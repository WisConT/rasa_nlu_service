she O

together O
for O
a O
three B-CARDINAL
- O
way O
meeting O
eventually O
. O


ah O
undoubtedly O
ah O
a O
very O
hasty O
project O
, O
especially O
that O
the B-GPE
hebrew I-GPE
state I-GPE
tried O
to O
implement O
this O
project O
alone O
, O
from O
the B-LOC
mediterranean I-LOC
sea I-LOC
to O
the B-LOC
red I-LOC
sea I-LOC
. O

and O
it O
was O
proved O
to O
them O
with O
certainty O
that O
the O
project O
is O
ineffective O
economically O
, O
as O
it O
will O
cost O
one B-MONEY
and I-MONEY
a I-MONEY
half I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

so O
they O
tried O
using O
their O
well O
- O
known O
means O
to O
transfer O
this O
project O
to O
another O
agency O
to O
implement O
it O
and O
finance O
it O
, O
while O
they O
reap O
the O
fruits O
from O
it O
. O

aha O
, O
aha O
. O

they O
have O
many O
goals O
ah O
for O
such O
a O
project O
, O
the O
most O
important O
of O
which O
is O
to O
build O
one O
hundred O
new O
settlements O
they O
have O
been O
planning O
to O
establish O
in O
the O
negev B-LOC
. O

ah O
. O

but O
now O
the O
fear O
is O
that O
they O
plan O
to O
build O
them O
across O
the O
extension O
of O
the O
new O
canal O
line O
from O
the B-LOC
red I-LOC
sea I-LOC
to O
the B-LOC
dead I-LOC
sea I-LOC
under O
various O
headers O
, O
including O
the O
headers O
ah O
of O
development O
and O
architecture O
and O
ah O
establishing O
new O
settlements O
. O

and O
since O
the O
subject O
has O
become O
open O
in O
jordan B-GPE
for O
everyone O
, O
there O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
the O
new O
construction O
projects O
that O
would O
be O
established O
on O
this O
line O
might O
reach O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
zionists B-NORP
. O

aha O
. O

and O
they O
might O
repeat O
the O
story O
as O
they O
started O
it O
in O
palestine B-GPE
by O
building O
settlements O
, O
and O
the O
eastern O
mountains O
will O
become O
occupied O
to O
the O
dead B-LOC
sea I-LOC
and O
araba B-LOC
valley I-LOC
, O
occupied O
by O
the O
zionists B-NORP
. O

aha O
, O
aha O
. O

this O
project O
is O
extremely O
dangerous O
, O
except O

%pw O
would O
n't O
%pw O
it O

a O

that O

deal O

the O

ordinarily O
the O

they O

because O

they O

one B-CARDINAL
of O

at O
the B-ORG

. O

mr. O
oriani B-PERSON
said O
his O
skepticism O
of O
the O
utah B-GPE
claims O
was O
initially O
confirmed O
when O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
experiments O
last B-DATE
spring I-DATE
failed O
to O
produce O
results O
. O

but O
he O
then O
borrowed O
a O
palladium O

from O

at O
texas B-ORG
a-amp-m I-ORG
who O
said O
they O
were O
getting O

`` O
the O

on O
the O

when O
it O

`` O

and O
produced O
excess O
heat O
for O
several B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O

down O
, O
he O
said O
. O

typical O
of O
other O
experiments O
, O
mr. O
oriani B-PERSON
said O
his O
experiment O
was O
`` O
very O
erratic O
. O
'' O

it O
would O
go O
along O
doing O
nothing O
but O
dissociating O
the O
heavy O
water O
and O
then O
at O
totally O
unpredictable O
times O
, O
it O
would O
begin O
producing O
excess O
heat O
for O
as O
long O
as O
10 B-TIME
or I-TIME
11 I-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
quieting O
down O
. O

the O
excess O
heat O
was O
15 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
to I-PERCENT
20 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
more O
than O
the O
energy O
involved O
in O
the O

of O

. O

mr. O
oriani B-PERSON
said O
the O
heat O
bursts O
were O
too O
large O
and O
too O
long O
to O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
sudden O
release O
of O
energy O
that O
might O
have O
slowly O
accumulated O
during O
the O
experiments O
' O
quiescent O
times O
, O
as O
some O
scientists O
have O
suggested O
. O

`` O
there O
is O
a O
reality O
to O
the O
excess O
energy O
, O
'' O
he O
said O
. O

other O
scientists O
said O
they O
also O
were O
getting O
sporadic O
bursts O
of O
excess O
heat O
lasting O
several B-TIME
hours I-TIME
at O
a O
time O
. O

the O
bursts O
often O
occur O
, O
they O
said O
, O
after O
they O
`` O
perturbed O
'' O
the O
experiments O
by O
raising O
or O
lowering O
the O
amount O
of O
electric O
current O

applied O
, O
or O
switching O
the O

off O

on O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
chemist O
privately O
suggested O
this O
hinted O
that O
some O
`` O
anomalous O
'' O
chemical O
reactions O
might O
be O
producing O
the O
heat O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
reason O
questions O
surround O
the O
heat O
experiments O
is O
that O
they O
involve O
unusually O
meticulous O
measurements O
. O

typically O
, O
the O
input O
energy O
ranges O
from O
a B-QUANTITY
third I-QUANTITY
of I-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
watt I-QUANTITY
to O
one B-QUANTITY
watt I-QUANTITY
and O
the O
excess O
energy O
is O
measured O
in O
tenths B-QUANTITY

a I-QUANTITY
watt I-QUANTITY
. O

one B-CARDINAL
exception O
is O
a O
continuing O
experiment O
at O
stanford B-ORG

one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O

mr. O

he O

any O
way O
to O
continuously O

the O
amount O

so O
it O

been O
difficult O

you O

dismiss O

the O
well O
interns B-ORG

%um O
interns B-ORG

yeah O
. O

yeah O

and O
then O
%um O
and O
then O
the O
next O
place O
which O
i O
was O
so O
hopeful O
about O
was O
was O
%um O
moden B-ORG
nisan I-ORG

yeah O

yeah O

that O
thing O
at O
haifa B-GPE
with O
%eh O
the B-ORG
young I-ORG

's I-ORG
leadership I-ORG
program I-ORG
. O

yeah O
? O

and O
the O
woman O
made O
it O
sound O
so O
promising O

and O
i O
waited O
two B-DATE
months I-DATE
to O
hear O
back O

mhm O
. O

and O
then O
i O
had O
n't O
heard O
from O
her O

and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
date O

so O
i O
called O

mhm O
. O

and O
she O
said O
oh O
i O
was O
going O
to O
fax O
you O
this O
evening O

%um O
you O
know O
we O
're O
not O
really O
sure O
what O
's O
happening O
. O

the O
position O
may O
be O
being O
redefined O

%eh O
. O

and O
then O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
, O
she O
called O
me O
and O
left O
a O
message O
saying O
oh O
you O
know O
they O
had O
all O
these O
things O
on O
the O
burner O

and O
r- O
i O
should O
really O
look O
someplace O
else O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
's O
going O
on O

and O

%hm O
. O

and O
so O
th- O
i O
had O
really O
stopped O
looking O
for O
things O
because O
he O
made O
it O
sound O
so O
promising O
and O
like O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
almost O
fulltime O
. O

%hm O
. O

and O
then O
that O
's O
a O
shame O

it O
you O

so O
instead O
it O

a O
ten O

a O

position O

and O
it O
requires O
fluent O
hebrew B-LANGUAGE

it O
's O
just O
totally O
different O
than O
what O
we O
had O
talked O
about O
. O

that O
's O
a O
shame O

and O
so O
then O
, O
meanwhile O

giva B-ORG

a O
a O
very O
short O

you O

the O

the O

one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O

the O

safety O
concerns O

, O
to O

key O
to O
the O
issue O
is O
that O
the O
bikes O
, O
in O
skillful O

, O
can O
go O
virtually O
anywhere O

in O

a O
thrill O
for O

for O

for O
harried O
public O

across O
the O

, O
the O
response O
is O
increasingly O
to O
shut O
the O

. O

the O
state O
of O
california B-GPE
, O
following O
the O
lead O
of O
some O
regional O

recently O
adopted O
regulations O

closed O

all O

the O

often O
these O

the O

potent O

it O

others O
, O
however O
, O
theorize O
that O
the O
artisans O
intentionally O
made O
the O

slightly O
larger O
than O
life O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
shrinkage O
that O
would O

not O

it O

the O
story O
of O
tumor O

goes O
back O
to O
the O
1970s B-DATE
, O
when O
a O
pediatrician O
named O
alfred B-PERSON
g. I-PERSON
knudson I-PERSON
jr. I-PERSON
proposed O
that O
retinoblastoma O
stemmed O
from O
two O
separate O
genetic O
defects O
. O

he O
theorized O
that O
in O
the O
eye O
cancer O
, O
an O
infant O
inherited O
a O
damaged O
copy O
of O
a O
gene O
from O
one O
parent O
and O
a O
normal O
copy O
from O
the O
other O
. O

the O
tumor O
, O
he O
suggested O
, O
developed O
when O
the O
second O
, O
normal O
copy O
also O
was O
damaged O
. O

but O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
prove O
dr. O
knudson B-PERSON
's O
`` O
two O
- O
hit O
'' O
theory O
. O

back O
then O
, O
scientists O
had O
no O
way O
of O
ferreting O
out O
specific O
genes O
, O
but O
under O
a O
microscope O
they O
could O
see O
the O
23 B-CARDINAL
pairs O
of O
chromosomes O
in O
the O
cells O
that O
contain O
the O
genes O
. O

occasionally O
, O
gross O
chromosome O
damage O
was O
visible O
. O

dr. O
knudson B-PERSON
found O
that O
some O
children O
with O
the O
eye O
cancer O
had O
inherited O
a O
damaged O
copy O
of O
chromosome O
no. O
13 B-CARDINAL
from O
a O
parent O
who O
had O
had O
the O
disease O
. O

under O
a O
microscope O
he O
could O
actually O
see O
that O
a O
bit O
of O
chromosome O
13 B-CARDINAL
was O
missing O
. O

he O
assumed O
the O
missing O
piece O
contained O
a O
gene O
or O
genes O
whose O
loss O
had O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
setting O
off O
the O
cancer O

but O
he O
did O
n't O
know O
which O
gene O

had O
disappeared O
. O

then O
, O
a O
scientific O
team O
led O
by O

, O
then O
at O
the B-ORG

by O
analyzing O

they O
found O
defects O
in O
the O
second O
copy O
of O
chromosome O
13 B-CARDINAL
in O
the O
exact O
area O
as O
in O
the O

it O
was O

the O

`` O

dr. O

next O
turned O
his O
attention O
to O

the O
second B-ORDINAL
biggest O
cancer O

in O
the O
u.s. B-GPE
after O

he O
believed O
colon O
cancer O
might O
also O
arise O
from O
multiple O
`` O

'' O
on O

genes O
, O
because O
it O
often O
seems O
to O
develop O
in O
stages O

it O
often O
is O
preceded O
by O
the O
development O
of O

in O
some O

become O
increasingly O
malignant O

dr. O

some O

only O

in O
both O

gradually O
, O
a O

picture O

emerged O

if O
both O

if O

deleted O

the O

it O

" O
what O

" O

in O

i O

exactly O

classified O

rather O

i O
was O
not O
expecting O
those O
answers O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
intensive O
pressure O
and O
the O
attack O
launched O
by O
our O
local O

, O
which O
has O
a O
bias O
for O
the O
liberal O
current O
, O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
endorse O
women O
driving O
. O

i O
believe O
it O
is O
not O
love O
and O
concern O
for O
women O
as O
much O
as O
this O
decision O
is O
the O
dream O
to O
pave O

for O
other O
horizons O
and O
projects O
to O
liberate O

walk O

. O

our O
attempt O
, O
as O
conservatives O
, O
to O
stand O
up O
against O
issues O
such O
as O
these O
must O
not O
be O
satisfied O
with O
only O
the O
fatwas O
of O
important O
scholars O
, O
but O
we O
must O
employ O
other O
means O
. O

i O
liked O
one B-CARDINAL
cartoonist O
who O
depicted O
the O
situation O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
her O
car O
while O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
tires O
failed O
, O
and O
how O
a O
young O
man O
came O
to O
rescue O
her O
. O

above O
his O
head O
hearts O
of O
love O
and O
infatuation O
were O
drawn O
. O

this O
cartoonist O
supported O
the O
issue O
with O
his O
brush O
and O
depicted O
how O
danger O
lurks O
if O
it O
is O
endorsed O
. O

now O
we O
are O
in O
need O
of O
such O
ideas O
more O
than O
we O
need O
rhetorical O
speeches O
that O
people O
are O
fed O
up O
with O
. O

since O
i O
think O
that O
publishing O
the O
statements O
made O
by O
athletes O
, O
actors O
, O
and O
singers O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
to O
help O
us O
to O
serve O
this O
cause O
, O
and O
since O
these O
interviews O
came O
through O
the O
newspaper O
al B-ORG

jazirah I-ORG

i O
think O
that O
if O

watan I-ORG

they O
would O
have O
stopped O

the O

because O
they O
are O
known O
for O
their O

they O
do O
not O
know O
neutrality O
when O
exposing O
and O
they O
do O
not O
like O
these O

as O
it O
happened O
with O

when O
it O

i O

following O
analysis O

currently O
the O
prc B-GPE
weapons O
which O
pose O
the O
greatest O
threat O
to O
taiwan B-GPE
are O
sukhoi B-PRODUCT

of O
these O
, O
the O

are O
already O
strategically O

be O
alert O

" O
we O
can O
defend O

with O

but O
we O
currently O
have O
only O
limited O
ability O
to O
intercept O

. O

the O
most O
important O
subject O
for O
the O

is O
to O

any O

from O
the O
point O
of O

, O
the O
us B-GPE
clearly O
does O
not O
want O

the O

negatively O

for O

, O
the O

would O
be O
enormous O
. O

the B-GPE
united I-GPE

has O
thus O
been O
deliberately O
unclear O
- O
it O
does O
not O
exclude O
taiwan B-GPE
from O

but O
it O

not O

while O

so O
this O

a O

thus O
, O
from O

it O

seems O
most O
practical O
for O

to O
have O
its O

moreover O

this O
is O
also O
necessary O
from O

in O

out O
that O
perhaps O
for O
some O

have O

but O
in O
taiwan B-GPE

where O

, O
because O
the O

accounted O
for O
this O

already O

rather O
, O
the O
main O
problem O
is O
in O
the O
nation O

military O
service O

which O
makes O
it O
difficult O

most O

at O

fifth B-ORDINAL
f B-ORG

16 I-ORG

held O
last B-DATE
december I-DATE
in O
hualien B-GPE
, O
there O
were O
" O
more O

. O
" O

this O
newly O
established O
26th B-ORG
fighter I-ORG
squadron I-ORG
has O
18 B-CARDINAL
fighter O
aircraft O
, O
but O
less B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
pilots O
. O

according O
to O
the B-ORG
air I-ORG
force I-ORG
, O
this O
problem O
is O
the O
result O
of O
the O
transition O
period O
to O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
aircraft O
. O

for O
pilots O
to O
qualify O
for O
the O
new O
aircraft O
, O
they O
must O
have O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
400 I-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
flying O
experience O
. O

but O
taiwan B-GPE
's O
pilots O
get O
limited O
time O
in O
the O
air O
, O
so O
there O
are O
n't O
enough O
qualified O
pilots O
. O

experts O
explain O
that O
taiwan B-GPE
has O
limited O
airspace O
, O
and O
virtually O
no O
space O
for O
training O
. O

moreover O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
virtually O
all O
of O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
group O
of O
pilots O
who O
went O
abroad O
to O
receive O
training O
for O
new O
fighter O
aircraft O
have O
left O
the O
military O
to O
fly O
for O
civilian O
airlines O
, O
so O
the O
problem O
of O
talent O
outflows O
is O
severe O
. O

the O
same O
applies O
to O
other O
types O
of O
high O
- O
tech O
material O
. O

doctrine O
, O
not O
weapons O

it O
is O
bad O
enough O
that O
high O
- O
tech O
weapons O
may O
be O
rendered O
irrelevant O
by O
the O
inability O
to O
utilize O
them O
properly O
. O

another O
problem O
is O
that O
they O
might O
be O
bypassed O
altogether O
by O
a O
different O

a O

what O

that O

we O

that O

in O

they O

that O

ah O
these O

agree O

it O

decent O

good O
people O
who O
are O
either O
devout O
moslems B-NORP

very O
religious O

grew O
up O

they O
are O
double O
victims O
of O
an O
outside O

which O
now O
develops O
islamophobia O

of O
their O

the O
problem O
is O
that O
the O

majority O
of O
these O
moslems B-NORP
are O
not O
part O

the O
terror O

the O

they O
also O
do O
not O
stand O
up O

the O

a B-DATE

we O

these O
are O
the O
four B-CARDINAL

they O

if O
i O
may O
use O
this O
expression O

only O
lately O

even O
after O

it O
seems O
that O
most O

not O

understand O
this O
weapon O

it O
is O
a O

its O
real O

the O

it O

it O

spectacular O

horrible O

many O
of O

it O

great O
detail O

one O
such O
murder O

with O
the O
help O

can O
destroy O

quite O
a O
while O
, O
as O
it O
did O
in O

in O

but O
the O
real O
fear O
comes O
from O
the O
undisputed O
fact O
that O
no O
defense O

no O
preventive O
measures O
can O
succeed O
against O
a O
determined O

we O
may O

the O

but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
murder O

you O
do O
not O
have O
to O
board O

the O

the O

through O

religious O

also O
through O
inciting O

it O
is O
this O
circle O

and O
that O
exposure O

can O

can O

these O
are O
the O
old O
- O
fashioned O
dilemmas O

but O
now O
we O
have O
an O
entire O
new O
set O
. O

do O
you O
raid O
a O
mosque O
, O
which O
serves O
as O
a O
terrorist O
ammunition O
storage O
? O

do O
you O
return O
fire O
, O
if O
you O
are O
attacked O
from O
a O

do O
you O
storm O
a O
church O
taken O
over O
by O
terrorists O
who O
took O
the O
priests O
hostages O
? O

do O
you O
search O
every O
ambulance O
after O
a O
few O
suicide O
murderers O
use O
ambulances O
to O
reach O
their O
targets O
? O

do O
you O
strip O
every O
woman O
because O
one O
pretended O
to O
be O
pregnant O
and O
carried O
a O
suicide O
bomb O
on O
her O
belly O
? O

do O
you O
shoot O
back O
at O
someone O
trying O
to O
kill O
you O
, O
standing O
deliberately O
behind O
a O
group O
of O
children O
? O

do O
you O
raid O
terrorist O
headquarters O
, O
hidden O
in O
a O
mental O
hospital O
? O

do O
you O
shoot O
an O
arch-murderer O
who O
deliberately O
moves O
from O
one O
location O
to O
another O
, O
always O
surrounded O
by O
children O
? O

all O
of O
these O
happen O
daily O
in O
iraq B-GPE
and O
in O
the O
palestinian B-NORP
areas O
. O

what O
do O
you O
do O
? O

well O
, O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
face O
the O
dilemma O
. O

but O
it O
can O
not O
be O
avoided O
. O

suppose O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
discussion O
, O
that O
someone O
would O
openly O
stay O
in O
a O
well O
- O
known O
address O
in O
teheran B-GPE
, O
hosted O
by O
the O
iranian B-NORP
government O
and O
financed O
by O
it O
, O
executing O
one O
atrocity O
after O
another O
in O
spain B-GPE
or O
in O
france B-GPE
, O
killing O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
innocent O
people O
, O
accepting O
responsibility O
for O
the O
crimes O
, O
promising O
in O
public O
tv O
interviews O
to O
do O
more O
of O
the O
same O
, O
while O
the B-ORG
government I-ORG
of I-ORG
iran I-ORG
issues O
public O
condemnations O
of O
his O
acts O
but O
continues O
to O
host O
him O
, O
invite O
him O
to O
official O
functions O
and O
treat O
him O
as O
a O
great O
dignitary O
. O

i O
leave O
it O
to O
you O
as O
homework O
to O
figur O
out O
what O
spain B-GPE
or O
france B-GPE
would O
have O
done O
, O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
. O

the O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
civilized O
world O
is O
still O
having O
illusions O
about O
the O
rule O
of O
law O
in O
a O
totally O
lawless O
environment O
. O

it O
is O
trying O
to O
play O
ice O
hockey O
by O
sending O
a O
ballerina O
ice O
- O
skater O
into O
the O
ring O
or O
to O
knock O
out O
a O
heavyweight O
boxer O
by O
a O
chess O
player O
. O

in O
the O
same O
way O
that O
no O
country O
has O
a O
law O
against O
cannibals O
eating O
its O
prime O
minister O
, O
because O
such O
an O
act O
is O
unthinkable O
, O
international O
law O
does O
not O
address O
killers O
shooting O
from O
hospitals O
, O
mosques O
and O
ambulances O
, O
while O
being O
protected O
by O
their O
government O
or O
society O
. O

international O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
handle O
someone O
who O
sends O
children O
to O
throw O
stones O
, O
stands O
behind O
them O
and O
shoots O
with O
immunity O
and O
can O
not O
be O
arrested O
because O
he O
is O
sheltered O
by O
a O
government O
. O

international O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
leader O
of O
murderers O
who O
is O
royally O
and O
comfortably O
hosted O
by O
a O
country O
, O
which O
pretends O
to O
condemn O
his O
acts O
or O
just O
claims O
to O
be O
too O
weak O
to O
arrest O
him O
. O

the O
amazing O
thing O
is O
that O
all O
of O
these O
crooks O
demand O
protection O
under O
international O
law O
, O
and O
define O
all O
those O
who O
attack O
them O
as O
`` O
war O
criminals O
, O
'' O
with O
some O
western O
media O
repeating O
the O
allegations O
. O

the O
good O
news O
is O
that O
all O
of O
this O
is O
temporary O
, O

because O
the O
evolution O
of O
international O
law O
has O
always O
adapted O
itself O
to O
reality O
. O

the O
punishment O
for O
suicide O
murder O
should O
be O
death O
or O
arrest O
before O
the O
murder O
, O
not O
during O
and O
not O
after O
. O

after O
every O
world O
war O
, O
the O
rules O
of O
international O
law O
have O
changed O
, O
and O
the O
same O
will O
happen O
after O
the O
present O
one O
. O

but O
during O
the O
twilight O
zone O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
harm O
can O
be O
done O
. O

the O
picture O
i O
described O
here O
is O
not O
pretty O
. O

what O
can O
we O
do O
about O
it O
? O

in O
the O
short O
run O
, O
only O
fight O
and O
win O
. O

in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
only O
educate O
the O
next O
generation O
and O
open O
it O
to O
the O
world O
. O

the O
inner O
circles O
can O
and O
must O
be O
destroyed O
by O
force O
. O

the O
outer O
circle O
can O
not O
be O
eliminated O
by O
force O
. O

here O
we O
need O
financial O
starvation O
of O
the O
organizing O
elite O
, O
more O
power O
to O
women O
, O
more O
education O
, O
counter-propaganda O
, O
boycott O
whenever O
feasible O
and O
access O
to O
western O
media O
, O
internet O
and O
the O
international O
scene O
. O

above O
all O
, O
we O
need O
a O
total O
absolute O
unity O
and O
determination O
of O
the O
civilized O
world O
against O
all O
three B-CARDINAL
circles O
of O
evil O
. O

allow O
me O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
to O
depart O
from O
my O
alleged O
role O
as O
a O
taxi O
driver O
and O
return O
to O
science O
. O

when O
you O
have O
a O
malignant O
tumor O
, O
you O
may O
remove O
the O
tumor O
itself O
surgically O
. O

you O
may O
also O
starve O
it O
by O
preventing O
new O
blood O
from O
reaching O
it O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
, O
thereby O
preventing O
new O
`` O
supplies O
'' O
from O
expanding O
the O
tumor O
. O

if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
is O
best O
to O
do O
both O
. O

but O
before O
you O
fight O
and O
win O
, O
by O
force O
or O
otherwise O
, O
you O
have O
to O
realize O
that O
you O
are O
in O
a O
war O
, O
and O
this O
may O
take O
europe B-LOC
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

in O
order O
to O
win O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
first B-ORDINAL
eliminate O
the O
terrorist O
regimes O
, O
so O
that O
no O
government O
in O
the O
world O
will O
serve O
as O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
these O
people O
. O

i O
do O
not O
want O
to O
comment O
here O
on O
whether O
the O
american B-NORP
- O
led O
attack O
on O
iraq B-GPE
was O
justified O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
or O
any O
other O
pre-war O
argument O
, O
but O
i O
can O
look O
at O
the O
post-war O
map O
of O
western B-LOC
asia I-LOC
. O

now O
that O
afghanistan B-GPE
, O
iraq B-GPE
and O
libya B-GPE
are O
out O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
terrorist O
states O
remain O
: O
iran B-GPE
, O
syria B-GPE
and O
lebanon B-GPE
, O
the O
latter O
being O
a O
syrian B-NORP
colony O
. O

perhaps O
sudan B-GPE
should O
be O
added O
to O
the O
list O
. O

as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
conquest O
of O
afghanistan B-GPE
and O
iraq B-GPE
, O
both O
iran B-GPE
and O
syria B-GPE
are O
now O
totally O
surrounded O
by O
territories O
unfriendly O
to O
them O
. O

iran B-GPE
is O
encircled O
by O
afghanistan B-GPE
, O
by O
the B-GPE
gulf I-GPE
states I-GPE
, O
iraq B-GPE

the O
moslem B-NORP
republics O
of O
the O
former O
soviet B-GPE

syria B-GPE
is O
surrounded O
by O
turkey B-GPE
, O
iraq B-GPE
, O
jordan B-GPE
and O
israel B-GPE
. O

this O
is O
a O
significant O
strategic O
change O
and O
it O
applies O
strong O
pressure O
on O
the O
terrorist O
countries O
. O

it O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
iran B-GPE
is O
so O
active O
in O
trying O
to O
incite O
a O
shiite B-NORP
uprising O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

i O
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
american B-NORP
plan O
was O
actually O
to O
encircle O
both O
iran B-GPE
and O
syria B-GPE
, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
resulting O
situation O
. O

in O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
the O
number O
one B-CARDINAL
danger O
to O
the O
world O
today O
is O
iran B-GPE
and O
its O
regime O
. O

it O
definitely O
has O
ambitions O
to O
rule O
vast O
areas O
and O
to O
expand O
in O
all O
directions O
. O

it O
has O
an O
ideology O
which O
claims O
supremacy O
over O
western O
culture O
. O

it O
is O
ruthless O
. O

it O
has O
proven O
that O
it O
can O
execute O
elaborate O
terrorist O
acts O
without O
leaving O
too O
many O
traces O
, O
using O
iranian B-NORP
embassies O
. O

it O
is O
clearly O
trying O
to O
develop O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

its O
so O
- O
called O
moderates O
and O
conservatives O
play O
their O
own O
virtuoso O
version O
of O
the O
`` O
good O
- O
cop O
versus O
bad O
- O
cop O
'' O
game O
. O

iran B-GPE
sponsors O
syrian B-NORP
terrorism O
, O

it O
is O
certainly O
behind O
much O
of O
the O
action O
in O
iraq B-GPE
, O

it O
is O
fully O
funding O
the O
hezbollah B-ORG

, O
through O
it O

the O
palestinian B-NORP
hamas B-ORG

it O

at O

in O

in O
south B-LOC
america I-LOC
and O
probably O
also O
in O
uzbekistan B-GPE
and O
saudi B-GPE
arabia I-GPE

and O
it O
truly O
leads O
a O
multi-national O
terror O
consortium O

which O
includes O

as O
minor O
players O
, O
syria B-GPE

certain O
shiite B-NORP
elements O

nevertheless O
, O
most O

still O
trade O

iran B-GPE

try O

it O
and O
refuse O
to O
read O
the O
clear O

in O

the O

it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
dry O
the O

of O
the O

it O
is O
pointless O
to O
try O
to O

the O
subtle O
differences O
between O
the O
sunni B-NORP
terror O
of O
al B-ORG

which O
is O
the O

it O
really O

what O
matters O

that O

they O

the O

that O

driving O

the O

story O
will O
surely O
end O
up O

extremely O

to O
other O
european B-NORP

who O

itself O

is O
the O
solution O
a O
democratic O
arab B-NORP
world O

if O
by O
democracy O
we O
mean O
free O

also O
free O

a O

then O
yes O
, O
democracy O
is O
the O

if O
democracy O

it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O

will O
be O

the O
one O
whose O

the O

we O

it O

a O

in O

it O

on O
the O

a O

be O
a O

today B-DATE
since O
we O
came O
we O
've O
been O
talking O
about O
this O
phrase O

brand O
, O
ah O
, O
but O
what O
exactly O
does O
it O
mean O
. O

because O
we O
also O
know O
that O
actually O
the O
engines O
in O
some O
models O
of O
chery B-ORG
are O
not O
made O
by O
the O
company O
itself O
, O
so O
how O
do O
we O
explain O
domestic O
brand O
. O

domestic O
brand O
, O
eh O
, O
actually O
is O
just O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
, O
it O
's O
our O
own O
baby O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
, O
the O
baby O
son O
is O
not O
adopted O
, O
but O
our O
very O
own O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
your O
own O
baby O
's O
arms O
and O
legs O
can O
be O
bought O
from O
other O
people O
and O
put O
on O
. O

so O
, O
so O
, O
eh O
, O
among O
these O
kinds O
of O
domestic O
brands O
, O
there O
is O
still O
some O
distance O
between O
the O
complete O
brand O
and O
the O
product O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

because O
the O
brand O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
incorporates O
the O
product O
, O
ah O
, O
incorporates O
the O
company O
, O
ah O
, O
incorporates O
a O
lot O
of O
content O
, O
and O
includes O
its O
denotation O
and O
its O
connotation O
, O
many O
emotional O
things O
, O
while O
the O
product O
itself O
, O
eh O
, O
is O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
brand O
, O
ah O
. O

yeah O
. O

so O
, O
how O
should O
we O
view O
this O
part O
of O
the O
product O
. O

we O
think O
that O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
is O
exactly O
, O
eh O
, O
in O
the O
process O
of O
independent O
innovation O
, O
then O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
completely O
cut O
ourselves O
off O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

because O
, O
for O
example O
, O
at O
present O
, O
we O
of O
are O
still O
using O
, O
using O
some O
chips O
from O
abroad O
as O
some O
of O
our O
chips O
in O
computers O
. O

so O
this O
entire O
process O
is O
a O
process O
of O
how O
to O
transform O
the O
main O
parts O
and O
the O
core O
parts O
by O
phases O
. O

first B-ORDINAL
we O
must O
have O
our O

, O
first B-ORDINAL
we O
must O
have O
the O
main O
part O

our O
own O

. O

then O
we O
must O
gradually O
, O
step O
by O

perfect O
the O

the O
nature O

but O
does O
it O

some O
atmospheric O
scientists O
think O
that O
even O
if O

the O

at O
an O

the O

it O
's O
easy O
to O
get O
something O
comparable O
by O
simply O
moving O
to O
a O
higher O
altitude O
in O
the O
u.s. B-GPE
. O

moreover O
, O
there O
are O
questions O
, O
particularly O
among O
atmospheric O
scientists O
who O
know O
this O
subject O
best O
, O
about O
the O
ability O
of O
anyone O
to O
know O
what O
in O
fact O
is O
happening O
to O
the O
ozone O
layer O
. O

it O
is O
generally O
agreed O
that O
when O
cfcs O
rise O
from O
earth O
to O
stratosphere O
, O
the O
chlorine O
in O
them O
is O
capable O
of O
interfering O
with O
the O
process O
through O
which O
ultraviolet O
rays O
split O
oxygen O
molecules O
and O
form O
ozone O
. O

but O
ozone O
creation O
is O
a O
very O
large O
- O
scale O
natural O
process O
and O
the O
importance O
of O
human O
- O
generated O
cfcs O
in O
reducing O
it O
is O
largely O
a O
matter O
of O
conjecture O
. O

the O
ozone O
layer O
is O
constantly O
in O
motion O
and O
thus O
very O
hard O
to O
measure O
. O

what O
scientists O
have O
known O
since O
the O
late O
1970s O
is O
that O
there O
is O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
layer O
over O
antarctica B-LOC
that O
expands O
or O
contracts O
from O
year B-DATE
to O
year B-DATE
. O

but O
it O
is O
at O
least O
worthy O
of O
some O
note O
that O
there O
are O
very O
few O
refrigerators O
in O
antarctica B-LOC
. O

moreover O
, O
surely O
someone O
has O
noticed O
that O
household O
refrigerators O
are O
closed O
systems O
, O
running O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
without O
either O
the O
cfc O
gas O
or O
the O

ever O
escaping O
. O

another O
argument O
of O
the O
environmentalists O
is O
that O
if O
substitutes O
are O
available O
, O
why O
not O
use O
them O
? O

mr. O
teagan B-PERSON
cites O
a O
list O
of O
substitutes O
but O
none O
, O
so O
far O
, O
match O
the O
nonflammable O
, O
nontoxic O
cfcs O
. O

butane O
and O
propane O
can O
be O
used O
as O
coolants O
, O
for O
example O
, O
but O
are O
flammable O
. O

moreover O
, O
new O

will O
be O
needed O
to O
protect O

from O
the O
new O
formulations O
, O
which O
, O
as O
with O
cfcs O
, O
are O
solvents O
. O

mr. O
teagan B-PERSON
points O
out O
as O
well O
that O
if O
the O
equipment O
designed O
to O
get O
along O
without O
cfcs O
is O
less O
efficient O
than O
current O
devices O
, O
energy O
consumption O
will O
rise O
and O
that O
will O
worsen O
the O
greenhouse O

. O

folks O
in O
the O

a O

where O
the O

. O

the O
thing O
is O
in O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
city I-GPE
it O
might O
be O
hot O
but O
at O

like O

like O
i O
need O
a O
car O
to O
get O
around O
to O
the O
places O
that O
i O
need O
to O
get O
to O
because O
%eh O
things O
are O
so O
sort O
of O
scattered O
around O

they O
're O
like O
it O
's O
like O

and O
i O
'm O
interested O
in O

more O
with O

and O
so O
that O
was O
really O
good O

we O
there O
was O
a O
concert O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O

and O
i O
felt O
that O
's O
great O
pretty O
good O
about O
my O
contribution O
to O
that O

like O
it O
was O
n't O
really O
exactly O
what O
i O
would O
want O

but O
i O
felt O
like O
like O
i O

oh O
that O
's O
great O
. O

yeah O

so O
that O
was O
g- O
that O
was O
good O

that O
was O
something O
that O
you O
know O
like O
y- O
being O
here O
gave O
me O
access O
to O
. O

i O
'm O
also O
learning O
a O
lot O
about O
computers O
like O
%um O
like O
about O
other O
things O
about O
computers O
like O
about O
%um O
you O
know O
how O
to O
do O
email O
and O
how O
to O
do O
like O
email O
's O
interesting O
. O
networking O

yeah O

yeah O

i O
mean O
if O
you O
get O
if O
you O
get O
a O
laptop O
and O
you O
should O
also O
try O
to O
get O
a O
modem O
and O
hook O
it O
up O
to O
a O
phone O
because O
then O
you O
can O
have O

i O
may O
have O
to O

well O
i O
mean O
like O
i O
have O
a O
lapt- O
i O
have O
a O
an O
email O
address O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
else O
that O
you O
know O
has O
an O
email O
address O

but O
it O
's O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
that O
i O
would O
like O

i O
'm O
trying O
to O
t- O

you O
can O
get O
contact O
with O
people O
easy O
. O

yeah O

i O
'm O
trying O
to O
like O
tell O
people O
because O
it O
only O
costs O
like O
a O
local O
phone O
call O

like O
if O
you O
if O
you O
call O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
i O
mean O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
write O
to O
somebody O
in O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
you O
could O
like O
you O
could O
like O
type O
it O
up O

it O
's O
like O
a O
%eh O
a O
fax O
%uh O
thing O
. O

yeah O

it O
's O
but O
it O
's O
better O

it O
's O
even O
cheaper O
than O
a O
fax O
i O
think O
because O
it O
's O
%um O

yeah O

and O
it O
it O
goes O
into O
the O
computer O

it O
's O
not O
like O
with O
paper O
. O

right O

it O
's O
not O
with O
paper O

but O
it O
's O
and O
it O
's O
cheaper O
because O
it O
's O
c- O
it O
's O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
local O
phone O
call O
whereas O
a O
fax O
takes O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
that O
the O
that O
the O
phone O
call O

oh O
that O
's O
great O
. O

no O

it O
's O
really O
great O

and O
then O
you O
can O
get O
access O
to O
all O
any O
as O
any O
information O
you O
really O
need O

i O
mean O
if O
you O
needed O
something O
about O
research O
or O
whatever O
you O

right O

right O

yeah O

this O
is O
amazing O
to O
me O
. O

yeah O

so O
yeah O
like O
the O
internet O
and O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O

so O
that O
's O
that O
's O
like O

so O
i O
'm O
learning O
about O
that O

so O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
cool O

and O
%um O
and O
then O
%uh O
that O
's O
great O
and O
i O
'm O

because O
that O

i O
think O

oh O
really O

oh O
that O
's O
well O

you O

well O
as O
frank B-PERSON

there O

there O
are O
many O
very O
devastating O
eh O
comments O
and O
conclusions O
about O
judy B-PERSON
miller I-PERSON
as O
a O
journalist O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
times B-ORG
had O
any O
choice O
though O
howie B-PERSON
. O
because O
remember O
as O
a O
press O
reporter O
back O
on O
july B-DATE
twenty I-DATE
- I-DATE
seventh I-DATE
the O
turmoil O
in O
the O

has O
been O
going O
on O

months B-DATE
about O
judy B-PERSON

and O
the O
way O
the O

has O
decided O

cover O
the O

the O
way O
they O
decided O
to O
present O
her O
as O
a O
martyr O
for O
the B-LAW
first I-LAW
amendment I-LAW
. O

and O
the O
main O
unanswered O
question O
here O
is O
why O
did O
arthur B-PERSON
sulzberger I-PERSON
the O
newspaper O
's O
publisher O
allow O
judy B-PERSON
miller I-PERSON
to O
hijack O
the O

the O

policy O
on O
that O

. O

and O
the O
similarities O
for O
the O
jayson B-PERSON
blair I-PERSON
case O
. O

remember O
after O
the O
jayson B-PERSON
blair I-PERSON
scandal O
broke O
we O
had O
a O
seven B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
word I-CARDINAL
story O
that O
did O
not O
give O
a O
full O
account O
of O
what O
happened O
. O
especially O
about O
why O
is O
a O
major O
institution O
like O
the O
times B-ORG
ignoring O
so O
many O
red O
flags O
. O

alright O
. O

in O
the O
story O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
things O
that O
we O
learn O
is O
that O
bill B-PERSON
keller I-PERSON
took O
off O
judy B-PERSON
miller I-PERSON
off O
her O
wmd O
beat O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
first B-ORDINAL

when O
he O
took O
eh O
the O

as O

. O

alright O
. O

well O
i O
uh O
i O
w- O
agree O
there O
are O
some O
unanswered O
questions O
. O

but O
i O
'm O
willing O
to O
give O
the O
times B-ORG
a O
little O
more O
credit O
than O
you O
for O
at O
least O
to O
attempting O
to O
answer O
uh O
many O
of O
the O
questions O
. O

and O
lucy B-PERSON
dalglish I-PERSON
here O
's O
the O
th- O
the O
thing O
that O
jumped O
out O
at O
me O
in O
the O
story O
. O

judy B-PERSON
miller I-PERSON
acknowledges O
that O
at O
lou- O
at O
louis B-PERSON
libby I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
request O
this O
is O
the O
dick B-PERSON
cheney I-PERSON
aide O
she O
agreed O
to O
refer O
to O
him O
and O
in O
stories O
not O
as O
a O
senior O
administration O
official O
but O
as O
a O
former O
hill B-LOC

because O
he O
had O
once O
worked O
on O
capitol B-LOC
hill I-LOC
. O

do O
you O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
? O

i- O
i O
i O
i O
thought O
that O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
misleading O
. O

and O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
odd O
. O

i O
mean O
her O
justification O
was O
that O
well O
he O
had O
been O
a O
former O
hill B-LOC
staffer O
. O

um O
but O
that O
was O
a O
strange O

i O

was O
strange O

i O
'll O

i O
'll O

-- O
i O

frank B-PERSON
sesno I-PERSON
the O

was O
so O
hamstrung O
by O
its O
passionate O
embrace O
of O
this O
reporter O
who O
after O
all O
was O
facing O
jail O
did O
go O
to O

. O

one O
can O
understand O
the O
emotions O
uh O
that O
were O
unleashed O
here O
. O

and O
yet O
the O
editors O
discouraged O
stories O
on O
the O

leak O
investigation O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
killed O
a O
piece O
written O
by O
a O

about O

libby I-PERSON
. O

was O
that O
an O
abdication O
of O
journalistic O
responsibility O
? O

maybe O
yeah O
maybe O
. O

i O
mean O
and O
it O
shows O
-- O
what O
it O
really O
shows O
howie B-PERSON
i O
think O
is O
just O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
for O
news O
organizations O
to O
report O
on O
themselves O
. O

you O
know O
wh- O

demand O
total O

whether O

we O

we O
want O

we O
want O
full O

but O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
do O
it O
themselves O
. O

in O
this O
case O
and O
the O
times B-ORG
makes O
it O
very O
plain O
in O
their O
story O
today B-DATE
they O
really O
suffered O
. O

they O
were O
behind O
on O
virtually O
every O
major O

even O
when O
she O

even O
when O

w- O

when O

yeah O
w- O
at O
the O

they O
did O

that O
sh- O
you O

and O
the O
question O

this O
is O
a O

not O

no O

we O

to O

talking O
to O
judy B-PERSON
off O
and O
on O
about O
this O
case O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

this O
was O
a O
very O
difficult O
decision O
. O

and O
you O
know O
what O
this O
all O
comes O
down O
to O
is O
you O
keep O
your O
promises O
when O
you O
make O
a O
promise O
to O
a O
confidential O
source O
. O

you O
'll O
recall O
six B-DATE
or I-DATE
eight I-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
howie B-PERSON
i O
w- O
-- O
i O
was O
on O
the O
show O
and O
we O
were O
talking O
about O
you O
know O
did O
russert B-PERSON
and O
kessler B-PERSON
and O
and O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
those O
guys O
did O
they O
break O
some O
trust O
by O
agreeing O
to O
testify O
and O
observing O
the O
waiver O
? O

what O
i O
think O
this O
situation O
and O
the O
turmoil O
that O
is O
obviously O
going O
on O
at O
the O
times B-ORG
right O
now O
points O
out O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
have O
a O
major O
problem O
in O
this O
country O
. O

it O
's O
that O
reporters O
believe O
they O
need O
to O
keep O
their O
promises O
to O
their O
sources O
. O

reporters O
will O
will O
try O
to O
do O
whatever O
they O
can O
as O
long O
as O
the O
law O
allows O
them O
to O
to O
protect O
those O
sources O
. O

right O
. O

but O
that O
sources O
these B-DATE
days I-DATE
um O
with O
the O
state O
of O
our O
law O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
federal O
shield O
law O
we O
have O
prosecutors O
and O
civil O
litigants O
going O
in O
there O
and O
interfering O
with O
the O
day O
to O
day O
operation O
of O
our O
newsrooms O
. O

and O
we O
just O
can O
tolerate O
this O
. O

and O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
- O

i O
think O
lucy B-PERSON
's O
on O
to O
something O
here O
if O
i O
can O
just O
say O
howie B-PERSON
. O

and O
i O
think O
this O
is O
very O
important O
because O
this O
is O
an O
ugly O
case O
. O

and O
even O
people O
close O
to O
judith B-PERSON
miller I-PERSON
say O
this O
is O
not O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
you O
'd O
really O
like O
to O
go O
to O
the O
mat O
on O
. O

you O
'd O
love O
to O
have O
a O
clear O
whistle O
blower O
case O
. O

you O
'd O
love O
to O
have O
a O
pentagon B-ORG
papers O
case O
. O

you O
'd O
love O
to O
have O
something O
where O
the O
-- O
where O
the O
well O
- O
being O
and O
the O
-- O
and O
the O
sanctity O
of O
the O
republic B-ORG
you O
know O
hangs O
in O
the O
balance O
. O

she O
did O
n't O
even O
report O
on O
this O
. O

but O
it O
does O
point O
out O
a O
very O
serious O
issue O
. O

and O
that O
is O
the O
whole O
notion O
of O
the O
use O
of O
and O
abuse O
of O
confidential O
sources O
the O
protections O
that O
reporters O
do O
or O
do O
n't O
have O
and O
the O
propensity O
of O
this O
government O
uh O
the O
united B-GPE
states I-GPE
government O
to O
have O
more O
secrecy O
not O
less O
. O

we O
've O
got O
to O
figure O
this O
out O
. O

well O
just O
to O
clarify O
uh O
she O
did O
ultimately O
uh O
testify O
about O
her O
confidential O
source O
. O

the O
whole O
issue O
was O
how O
voluntary O
was O
the O
waiver O
of O
her O
promise O
to O
scooter O
*libby O
libby B-PERSON
offered O
and O
why O
was O
she O
able O
to O
accept O
after O
being O
in O
jail O
as O
opposed O
to O
before O
being O
in O
jail O
. O

well O
exactly O
. O

and O
you O
know O
what O
howie B-PERSON
. O
. O

it O
's O
really O
-- O
it O
's O
really O
time O
for O
lucy B-PERSON
and O
other O
judy B-PERSON
miller I-PERSON
defenders O
to O
update O
her O
talking O
points O
because O
what O
lucy B-PERSON
just O
said O
just O
simply O
does O
not O
wash O
. O

the O
truth O
is O
that O
as O
howie B-PERSON
said O
she O
did O
testify O
. O

the O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
's O
very O
clear O
from O
the O
stories O
today B-DATE
that O
she O
could O
've O
asked O
uh O
scooter B-PERSON
libby I-PERSON
to O
call O
her O
so O
that O
she O
could O
hear O
the O
timber O
of O
his O
voice O
earlier O
. O

all O
of O
that O
could O
have O
happened O
. O

it O
did O
not O
happen O
because O
clearly O
judy B-PERSON
miller I-PERSON
is O
protecting O
another O
source O
that O
she O
still O
has O
not O
revealed O
to O
the O
american B-NORP
public O
. O

and O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
is O
. O

lucy B-PERSON
. O

. O

let O
me O
get O
a O
response O
from O
lucy B-PERSON
dalglish I-PERSON
. O

i O
think O
it O
's O
very O
obvious O
from O
what O
judy B-PERSON
wrote O
today B-DATE
she O
is O
protecting O
somebody O
else O
. O

and O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
reasons O
that O
this O
negotiation O
took O
so O
long O
is O
that O
not O
only O
was O
she O
negotiating O
what O
she O
was O
going O
to O
say O
about O
scooter B-PERSON
libby I-PERSON
but O
you O
got O
to O
-- O
but O
you O
got O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
i O
'm O
a O
lawyer O
there O
were O
lawyers O
involved O
in O
this O
. O

they O
had O
to O
negotiate O
with O
patrick B-PERSON
fitzgerald I-PERSON
what O
he O
would O
not O
talk O
about O
. O

they O
also O
had O
to O
negotiate O
whether O
or O
not O
there O
would O
be O
any O
type O
of O
um O
y- O
uh O
uh O
obstruction O
charges O
connected O
with O
contacting O
. O

once O
you O
invoke O
the O
wrath O
or O
the O
extreme O
interest O
of O
a O
federal O
prosecutor O
you O
have O
to O
be O
very O
very O
careful O
. O

you O
do O
n't O
mess O
with O
the O
feds O
. O

it O
's O
very O
clear O
in O
her O
story O
that O
she O
decided O
finally O
to O
testify O
because O
she O
got O
tired O
of O
jail O
because O
she O
was O
threatened O
with O
criminal O
contempt O
charges O
because O
she O
wanted O
to O
go O
out O
and O
now O
she O
's O
saying O
admitting O
finally O
write O
a O
book O
. O

all O
these O
things O
are O
there O
in O
black O
and O
white O
. O

and O
to O
continue O
to O
portray O
her O
as O
a O
martyr O
is O
not O
going O
to O
work O
. O

and O
on O
that O
point O
arianna B-PERSON
on O
that O
point O
she O
she O
says O
sh- O
- O

excuse O
me O
. O

judy B-PERSON
miller I-PERSON
says O
she O
's O
taking O
some O
time O
off O
from O
the O
paper O
. O

she O
wants O
to O
write O
a O
book O
. O

she O
would O
n't O
share O
her O
notes O
with O
her O
colleagues O
who O
were O
writing O
the O

do O
you O

you O
think O
she O
's O
saving O
it O
for O
the O
book O

well O
it O
's O
very O
clear O
that O
she O
would O
not O

welcome O
in O

and O
it O
's O
very O
clear O
eh O
as O
i O
reported O
again O
that O
when O

took O
her O
off O
her O

they O
were O
all O
hoping O
she O

instead O
she O
threw O
a O

she O
stayed O
on O

this O

the O

that O

folks O
did O
plenty O
of O
speculating O

of O
a O
certain O
top O
white B-ORG

if O
he O

has O
to O
go O
it O
undermines O
the O
key O

of O
this O
president O

his O

. O

if O
rove B-PERSON
gets O
indicted O
that O
could O
bring O
down O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
i O
think O
. O

my O
understanding O
from O
talking O
to O
somebody O
quite O
close O
to O
this O
investigation O
is O
that O
they O
think O
there O
are O
going O

be O
indictments O

and O
possibly O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
could O

among O
them O

if O
karl B-PERSON

if O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
is O

, O
what O
if O
he O
's O
not O
indicted O
? O

is O
n't O
this O
the O
worst O
kind O
of O
journalistic O
speculation O
? O

yeah O
. O

you O
know O
i O
i O
think O
it O
's O
always O
dangerous O
to O
speculate O
whether O
or O
not O
y- O
you O
're O
really O
besmirching O
someone O
's O
reputation O
. O
although O
i O
'm O
not O
sure O
you O
can O
do O
that O
with O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
. O

but O
it O
uh O
is O
very O
very O
you O
know O
eh O
irre- O
- O

i O
i O
would O
prefer O
that O
people O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
what O
the O
test- O
-- O
you O
know O
watching O
him O
testify O
and O
going O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
courthouse O
. O

but O
uh O
will O
it O
bring O
down O
the O
administration O
? O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

ah O
eh O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

well O
nobody O
knows O
. O

that O
's O
the O
point O
. O

arianna B-PERSON
huffington I-PERSON
i O
used O
to O
cover O
the O
justice O
department O
. O

not O
everybody O
who O
's O
under O
investigation O
winds O
up O
getting O
indicted O
. O

ah O
but O
you O
certainly O
and O
you O
're O
uh O
on O
a O
blog O
so O
maybe O
it O
's O
a O
different O
standard O
have O
speculated O
about O
rove B-PERSON
's O
fate O
as O
well O
. O

well O
not O
just O
rove B-PERSON
though O
. O

what O
we O
have O
speculated O
is O
that O
it O
might O
be O
a O
much O
more O
tangled O
web O
that O
fitzgerald B-PERSON
is O
after O
the O
whole O
iraq B-GPE
white B-ORG
house I-ORG

the O

that O
uh O
in O

basically O
sold O

a O

the O
american B-NORP
public O
based O
on O
lies O
. O

i O
mean O
that O
is O
really O
the O
web O
. O

but O
it O
seems O
and O
we O
find O
out O
today B-DATE
also O
from O
uh O
um O
the O
reporting O
on O
the O
miller B-PERSON
story O
, O
that O
uh O
fitzgerald B-PERSON
is O
after O
cheney B-PERSON
even O
in O
some O
of O
the O
questioning O
eh O
of O
miller B-PERSON
. O

i O
think O
those O
were O
fairly O
routine O
questions O
about O

you O
you O
you O
d- O
have O
judy B-PERSON

there O

you O
ask O
about O

he O
was O

it O
's O
very O
easy O
to O
sit O
here O
and O
say O
oh O
we O
should O
never O
speculate O
in O
journalism O
. O

it O
's O
irresponsible O
journalism O
. O

it O
's O
really O
how O
you O
speculate O
not O
that O
you O
speculate O
. O

the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
that O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
has O
been O
to O
the O
grand O
jury O
four B-CARDINAL
times O
. O

the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
that O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
people O
in O
washington B-GPE
and O
believe O
me O
they O
're O
not O
all O
journalists O
who O
are O
speculating O
what O
if O
the O
guy O
gets O
indicted O
. O

it O
would O
be O
irresponsible O
i O
think O
for O
the O
media O
not O
to O
reflect O
what O
the O
the O
th- O
discussion O
is O
here O
in O
town O
. O

and O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
republicans B-NORP
mostly O
republicans B-NORP
who O
are O
worried O
about O
this O
. O

alright O
i O
want O
to O
turn O
now O
to O
the O
uh O
president O

now O
look O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
this O
is O
uncomfortable O
to O
see O
. O

and O
what O
the O
problem O
this O
now O
creates O
for O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
is O
{is} O
it O
plays O
into O
the O
credibility O
issue O
that O
the O
president O
has O
that O
everything O
now O
is O
becoming O
a O
photo O
op O
and O
and O
a O
rehearsed O
event O
in O
order O
to O
rescue O
what O
are O
tumbling O
numbers O
on O
his O
performance O
on O
public O
support O
of O
iraq B-GPE
the O
whole O
bit O
. O

but O
the O
fact O
that O
anybody O
would O
think O
that O
you O
would O
do O
something O
like O
this O
a O
remote O
. O

i O
mean O
anybody O
in O
television O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
's O
complicated O
business O
. O

you O
have O
satellite O
delay O
. O

you O
have O
a B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
people O
sitting O
there O
. O

who O
's O
going O
to O
speak O
when O
. O

you O
do O
n't O
want O
awkward O
silences O
. O

you O
're O
going O
to O
walk O
through O
it O
. O

so O
that O
it O
happened O
does O
n't O
surprise O
me O
. O

that O
it O
hurts O
the O
president O
yeah O
that O
's O
inevitable O
too O
. O

arianna B-PERSON
huffington I-PERSON
does O
the O
staging O
here O
surprise O
you O
at O
all O
? O

well O
it O
's O
not O
the O
question O
of O
surpising O
me O
howie B-PERSON
. O

it O
's O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
war O
. O

this O
is O
not O
just O
any O
photo O
opportunity O
. O

of O
course O
that O
's O
part O
and O
parcel O
of O
the O
presidency O
. O

but O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
a O
war O
in O
which O
almost B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
young O
americans B-NORP
have O
died O
. O

and O
we O
are O
also O
using O
soldiers O
as O
props O
. O

yes O
it O
is O
shocking O
. O

and O
i O
think O
keith B-PERSON
olbermann I-PERSON
did O
a O
phenomenal O
job O
at O
exposing O
this O
on O
msnbc B-ORG
. O

alright O
. O

and O
i O
think O
more O
and O
more O
journalists O
are O
actually O
taking O
a O
hard O
look O
at O
what O
this O
administration O
is O
doing O
. O

and O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
leave O
it O
there O
. O

last O
word O

. O

louis B-PERSON
freeh I-PERSON
says O
that O
when O
clinton B-PERSON
met O
with O
crown B-PERSON
prince I-PERSON
abdullah I-PERSON
in O
nineteen B-DATE
ninety I-DATE
- I-DATE
eight I-DATE
, O
he O
did O
n't O
press O
for O
fbi B-ORG
access O
to O
suspects O
in O
the O
khobar B-FAC
towers I-FAC
bombing O
and O
he O
hit O
up O
the O
prince O
for O
a O
contribution O
to O
his O
presidential O
library O
. O

well O
not O
only O
is O
that O
false O
and O
president O
clinton B-PERSON
has O
said O
so O
but O
everybody O
at O
the O
meeting O
who O
attended O
the O
meeting O
not O
including O
louis B-PERSON
freeh I-PERSON
says O
it O
's O
false O
. O

and O
my O
problem O
with O
sixty O
minutes O
is O
that O
they O
never O
called O
anybody O
at O
the O
meeting O
. O

until O
friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
we O
did O
n't O
even O
know O
the O
charge O
was O
being O
made O
. O

and O
even O
then O
they O
were O
unwilling O
to O
put O
somebody O
on O
the O
air O
to O
contradict O
mister O
freeh B-PERSON
. O

sixty B-ORG
minutes I-ORG
says O
bill B-PERSON
clinton I-PERSON
was O
offered O
a O
chance O
to O
come O
on O
and O
give O
his O
rebuttal O
. O

what O
's O
wrong O
with O
that O
? O

well O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
it O
's O
absolutely O
amazing O
that O
sixty B-ORG
minutes I-ORG
thinks O
it O
's O
okay O
to O
air O
a O
false O
and O
malicious O
statement O
. O

this O
is O
a O
terrible O
charge O
that O
an O
fbi B-ORG
investigation O
was O
thwarted O
because O
president O
clinton B-PERSON
wanted O
to O
receive O
money O
for O
his O
library O
. O

the O
charge O
was O
false O
. O

and O
the O
only O
way O
that O
that O
can O
be O
countered O
is O
a O
former O
president O
of O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
? O

what O
about O
anybody O
at O
the O
meeting O
who O
was O
willing O
to O
be O
on O
? O

what O
about O
them O
doing O
reporting O
themselves O
before O
they O
air O
a O
false O
and O
demonstrably O
false O
charge O
? O

that O
's O
my O
problem O
. O

what O
about O
sandy B-PERSON
berger I-PERSON
the O
former O
national O
security O
advisor O
under O
president O
clinton B-PERSON
? O

he O
was O
at O
the O
meeting O
. O

he O
was O
in O
the O
room O
. O

did O
you O
offer O
him O
for O
an O
on O
- O
camera O
interview O
? O

well O
on O
friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O

you O
were O
n't O
there O
. O

i O
was O
not O
there O
. O

you O
're O
good O
on O

. O

but O
you O
were O
n't O
there O
. O

i O
uh O
i O
talked O
to O
sandy B-PERSON
berger I-PERSON
. O

we O
issued O
a O
statement O
from O
mister O
berger B-PERSON
. O

but O
this O
was O
friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
when O
we O
first B-ORDINAL
learned O
about O
it O
with O
sunday B-DATE
broadcast O
. O

why O
did O
n't O
sixty B-ORG
minutes I-ORG
invite O
mister O
berger B-PERSON
or O
other O
people O
at O
the O
meeting O
before O
friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
? O

why O
did O
it O
take O
us O
to O
get O
sixty B-ORG
minutes I-ORG
to O
do O
basic O
reporting O
to O
verify O
facts O
? O

it O
's O
not O
enough O
to O
have O
louis B-PERSON
freeh I-PERSON
say O
something O
is O
so O
based O
on O
an O
anonymous O
source O
. O

that O
's O
poor O
journalism O
. O

on O
that O
point O
let O
me O
read O
a O
statement O
from O
a O
sixty B-ORG
minutes I-ORG
spokesman O
. O

and O
this O
involves O
uh O
their O
saying O
that O
they O
contacted O
clinton B-PERSON
's O
office O
back O
in O
august B-DATE
with O
a O
detailed O
list O
of O
charges O
and O
then O
quote O
in O
subsequent O
phone O
calls O
the O
president O
's O
people O
said O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
interviewed O
. O

they O
gave O
no O
+substantive O
response O
to O
any O
of O
the O
allegations O
until O
lanny B-PERSON
davis I-PERSON
launched O
his O
pr O
campaign O
on O
the B-DATE
thursday I-DATE
before I-DATE
the I-DATE
broadcast I-DATE
and O
offered O
himself O
as O
the O
person O
from O
the O
camp O
who O
would O
merely O
disparage O
and O
attack O
freeh B-PERSON
rather O
than O
deal O
with O
his O
allegations O
. O

denials O
from O
president O
clinton B-PERSON
and O
sandy B-PERSON
berger I-PERSON
that O
did O
deal O
with O
freeh B-PERSON
's O
allegations O
were O
included O
in O
the O
sixty B-WORK_OF_ART
minutes I-WORK_OF_ART
report O
. O

well O
first O
of O
all O
it O
's O
false O
to O
say O
that O
i O
was O
asking O
to O
disparage O
freeh B-PERSON
. O

i O
was O
asking O
to O
tal- O
k- O
talk O
about O
facts O
that O
freeh B-PERSON
was O
saying O
that O
were O
not O
true O
. O

you O
do O
n't O
mind O
disparaging O
freeh B-PERSON
. O

m- O
m- O
my O
observation O
. O

n- O
no O
in O
fact O
i O
disparage O
any O
man O
who O
as O
fbi B-ORG
director O
has O
a O
personal O
pique O
rather O
than O
doing O
his O
job O
. O

that O
's O
disparaging O
. O

secondly B-ORDINAL
it O
is O
absolutely O
a O
misrepresentation O
that O
they O
told O
us O
before O
just B-DATE
the I-DATE
week I-DATE
before I-DATE
. O

when O
mister O
carson B-PERSON
the O
representative O
spoke O
to O
mister O
wallace B-PERSON
mister O
wallace B-PERSON
agreed O
that O
they O
had O
never O
verified O
what O
mister O
f- O
fee- O
uh O
freeh B-PERSON
had O
said O
. O

they O
never O
talked O
to O
mister O
freeh B-PERSON
. O

and O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
n't O
until O
that B-DATE
friday I-DATE
that O
we O
learned O
the O
substance O
of O
mister O
freeh B-PERSON
's O
charges O
. O

so O
sixty B-ORG
minutes I-ORG
i O
think O
has O
just O
said O
something O
that O
is O
false O
. O

when O
did O
the O
clinton B-PERSON
team O
find O
out O
that O
sixty B-ORG
minutes I-ORG
was O
going O
to O
report O
that O
louis B-PERSON

the O
khobar B-FAC

and O
the O

about O

when O
somebody O
named O

kurtz I-PERSON
wrote O
a O
story O
in O
the B-ORG
washington I-ORG
post I-ORG
on O
friday B-TIME
morning I-TIME
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
the O
clinton B-PERSON

learned O
about O
that O
false O
and O
demonstrably O
false O
charge O
that O
good O

by O
calling O
people O
who O

the O
meeting O
could O
have O
done O
would O
have O
verified O
that O
mister O
freeh B-PERSON
made O
a O
false O
charge O
. O

and O
even O
since O
that O
interview O
mister O
freeh B-PERSON
has O
backed O
off O
and O
has O
not O
told O
people O
who O
his O
source O
is O
. O

and O
he O
has O
n't O
even O
insisted O
that O
it O
was O

he O
just O
said O
somebody O
told O

it O

true O
. O

hold O
on O
. O

sixty B-ORG
minutes I-ORG
spokesman O
kevin B-PERSON

told O
me O
. O

jay B-PERSON
carson I-PERSON
is O
the O

you O

uh O
nobody O
put O
it O
on O
the O

. O

bad O
news O
judgement O
? O

uh O
i O
think O
so O
howie B-PERSON
. O

i O
'm O
not O
here O
to O
cric- O
make O
a O
news O
point O
though O
. O

i O
'm O
really O
making O
a O
larger O
point O
which O
is O
about O
the O
war O
on O
terrorism O
. O

i O
'm O
a O
firm O
believer O
. O

how O
we O
ever O
going O
to O
win O
this O
war O
? O

we O
're O
never O
going O
to O
win O
it O
by O
way O
of O
american B-NORP
intelligence O
finding O
this O
terrorist O
or O
that O
terrorist O
. O

we O
get O
lucky O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

but O
there O
's O
only O
{one?} O
way O
we O
win O
this O
war O
howie B-PERSON
is O
it O
takes O
a O
village O
. O

it O
only O
happens O
when O
the O
sunni B-NORP
muslim I-NORP
world O
basically O
turns O
people O
in O
and O
when O
the O
sunni B-NORP
muslim I-NORP
world O
restrains O
their O
own O
. O

and O
what O
was O
so O
shocking O
to O
me O
about O
this O
story O
a O
sunni B-NORP
jihadi I-NORP
suicide O
bomber O
blows O
up O
a O
mosque O
number B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
on O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
ramadan I-DATE
. O

what O
that O
tells O
you O
is O
that O
there O
's O
no O
controlling O
moral O
authority O
today B-DATE
in O
the O
sunni B-NORP
muslim I-NORP
world O
. O

well O
what O
is O
the O
bigger O
story O
? O

and O
that O
is O
a O
huge O
story O
. O

i O
think O
it O
should O
have O
been O
a O
big O
story O
. O

why O
was O
n't O
- O

is O
it O
because O
of O
iraq B-GPE
fatigue O
? O

um O
. O

i O
think O
it O
is O
yeah O
. O

think O
it O
's O
- O

are O
all O
the O
editors O
and O
producers O
and O
new O
executives O
feeling O
another B-DATE
day I-DATE
another O
bombing O
ten B-CARDINAL
killed O
twenty B-CARDINAL
killed O
fifteen B-CARDINAL
killed O
. O

and O
it O
does O
n't O
ha- O
rise O
anymore O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
newscast O
or O
the O
front O
page O
? O

right O
. O

yeah O
and O
i O
think O
that O
's O
right O
. O

there O
is O
iraq B-GPE
fatigue O
. O

and O
there O
's O
so O
much O
fatigue O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
sit O
back O
and O
say O
wait O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
. O

what O
happened O
today B-DATE
? O

a O
sunni B-NORP
muslim I-NORP
fundamentalist O
went O
into O
a O
mosque O
on O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
ramadan I-DATE
their O
holiest O
day O
. O

and O
no O
one O
says O
boo O
. O

this O
is O
-- O
this O
is O
civilization O
that O
when O
we O
we O
accidentally O
or O
deliberately O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
abused O
the O
koran B-WORK_OF_ART
people O
rioted O
in O
pakistan B-GPE
. O

yet O
their O
own O
houses O
of O
worship O
and O
holidays O
are O
being O
defiled O
. O

and O
i O
think O
it O
is O
a O
measure O
of O
how O
much O
we O
've O
kind O
of O
lost O
been O
numbed O
by O
all O
of O
this O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
sit O
back O
and O
say O
wow O
wait O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
. O

that O
really O
crosses O
the O
line O
. O

and O
we O
have O
to O
call O
them O
on O
it O
even O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
. O

you O
're O
recently O
back O
from O
iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
you O
write O
about O
driving O
in O
from O
kuwait B-GPE
. O

you O
were O
guarded O
by O
the O
us B-GPE
navy O
. O

and O
yet O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
harrowing O
experience O
. O

why O
so O
? O

um O
you O
know O
the O
south O
of O
iraq B-GPE
which O
is O
where O
i O
was O
the O
area O
around O
. O

this O
is O
the O
safe O
part O
. O

right O
exactly O
. O

i O
was O
in O
the O
safe O
district O
. O

i O
was O
guarded O
uh O
by O
the B-ORG
british I-ORG
royal I-ORG
marines I-ORG
actually O
because O
unfortunately O
they O
've O
had O
now O
um O
uh O
roadside O
bombs O
down O
there O
not O
suicide O
bombs O
. O

and O
it O
's O
part O
of O
the O
general O
continuing O
insecurity O
of O
iraq B-GPE
that O
um O
i O
'm O
afraid O
has O
plagued O
this O
story O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
. O

and O
it O
's O
been O
i O
've O
always O
felt O
the O
achille B-PERSON
's O
heel O
. O

you O
know O
my O
my O
criticism O
of O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
as O
you O
know O
how- O
we O
've O
talked O
about O
this O
before O
is O
not O
that O
this O
war O
is O
not O
important O
. O

i O
believe O
it O
is O
important O
much O
more O
important O
than O
i O
think O
the O
left O
has O
ever O
fully O
recognized O
. O

but O
it O
's O
so O
much O
harder O
than O
the O
right O
has O
ever O
been O
willing O
to O
acknowledge O
. O

and O
on O
that O
trip O
you O
put O
on O
body O
armor O
. O

their O
their O
rifles O
were O
out O
. O

yeah O
. O

um O
how O
does O
that O
affect O
your O
perception O
as O
a O
journalist O
? O

you O
're O
there O
. O

you O
're O
being O
protected O
. O

and O
you O
're O
must O
have O
been O
a O
little O
bit O
nervous O
of O
of O
what O
the O
safety O
situation O
is O
in O
there O
. O

well O
i O
'll O
tell O
you O
what O
's O
really O
frustrating O
from O
a O
journalist O
's O
point O
of O
view O
as O
one O
who O
have O
lived O
in O
beirut B-GPE
for O
nearly B-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
covered O
that O
war O
. O

when O
i O
worked O
in O
lebanon B-GPE
you O
could O
go O
anywhere O
on O
that O
story O
. O

you O
could O
cross O
lines O
. O

journalists O
worked O
for O
the O
most O
part O
until O
the O
very O
end O
with O
terry B-PERSON
anderson I-PERSON
the O
kidnappings O
targets O
. O

therefore O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
lebanon B-GPE
story O
i O
thought O
the O
best O
journalists O
there O
knew O
more O
than O
the O
lebanese B-NORP
. O

i O
always O
thought O
the O
best O
compliment O
you O
could O
get O
as O
a O
journalist O
is O
when O
you O
told O
the O
lebanese B-NORP
something O
they O
did O
n't O
know O
because O
you O
were O
moving O
around O
so O
much O
. O

what O
's O
so O
frustrating O
about O
the O
iraq B-GPE
story O
howie B-PERSON
no O
one O
has O
a O
bird O
's O
eye O
view O
. O

i O
care O
passionately O
about O
this O
story O
. O

i O
'm O
so O
interested O
in O
it O
. O

but O
because O
of O
the O
securtiy O
situation O
you O
ca O
n't O
move O
around O
with O
the O
freedom O
you O
want O
. O

and O
the O
brave O
reporters O
who O
are O
there O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
do O
n't O
have O
that O
freedom O
of O
movement O
either O
. O

and O
therefore O
it O
's O
limited O
. O

and O
in O
fact O
as O
you O
know O
the O
administration O
says O
because O
of O
the O
security O
situation O
and O
maybe O
because O
of O
some O
biases O
in O
the O
media O
. O

there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
things O
going O
on O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
progress O
being O
made O
we O
're O
not O
seeing O
reported O
by O
the O
press O
. O

do O
you O
think O
that O
is O
a O
credible O
argument O
at O
this O
point O
in O
the O
mess O
there O
? O

no O
because O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
bird O
's O
eye O
view O
. O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
say O
. O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
be O
so O
sure O
. O

but O
general O
casey B-PERSON
does O
n't O
have O
a O
bird O
's O
eye O
view O
. O

and O
that O
's O
why O
we O
get O
surprises O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

uh O
that O
's O
why O
we O
had O
an O
election O
where O
eight B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
suddenly O
turn O
out O
. O

and O
maybe O
you O
know O
we O
're O
going O
to O
see O
more O
surpises O
in O
the O
coming O
future O
there O
. O

but O
because O
no O
one O
can O
move O
around O
with O
the O
freedom O
that O
you O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
everyone O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
bird O
's O
eye O
view O
. O

and O
as O
a O
reporter O
as O
a O
columnist O
who O
really O
cares O
about O
this O
story O
i O
find O
that O
really O
frustra- O
- O

i O
can O
not O
report O
it O
the O
way O
i O
'd O
love O
to O
. O

so O
i O
've O
been O
there O
five B-CARDINAL
times O
. O

but O
it O
's O
episodic O
. O

it O
's O
here O
. O

it O
's O
there O
. O

it O
's O
never O
really O
putting O
your O
arms O
around O
the O
story O
. O

tak- O
pulling O
back O
the O
camera O
a O
bit O
in O
recent B-DATE
months I-DATE
you O
'd O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
iraq B-GPE
story O
has O
been O
overshadowed O
by O
katrina B-EVENT
by O
rita B-EVENT
by O
tom B-PERSON
delay I-PERSON
by O
harriet B-PERSON
miers I-PERSON
by O
valerie B-PERSON
plame I-PERSON
and O
now O
by O
this O
pakistan B-GPE
earthquake O
. O

um O
inevitable O
with O
a O
war O
that O
drags O
on O
and O
on O
. O

and O
i O
'm O
-- O
and O
these O
are O
all O
also O
important O
stories O
obviously O
. O

but O
uh O
do O
you O
feel O
it O
's O
getting O
the O
attention O
that O
it O
should O
? O

yeah O
. O

no O
because O
to O
me O
this O
is O
the O
whole O
ballgame O
of O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
. O

katrina B-EVENT
and O
rita B-EVENT
they O
'll O
come O
and O
go O
. O

but O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
made O
a O
very O
big O
claim O
um O
that O
it O
could O
go O
to O
iraq B-GPE
um O
and O
produce O
a O
decent O
forward O
looking O
government O
there O
. O

if O
that O
happens O
then O
i O
think O
president O
bush B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
a O
a O
very O
huge O
quiver O
you O
know O
in O
his O
uh O
legacy O
there O
. O

um O
if O
it O
-- O
if O
it O
does O
n't O
happen O
i O
think O
uh O
the O
administration O
will O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
complete O
and O
utter O
failure O
. O

so O
everything O
rides O
on O
this O
not O
just O
for O
the O
administration O
though O
but O
for O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
. O

these O
are O
huge O
stakes O
involved O
. O

and O
so O
i O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
gotten O
the O
attention O
it O
's O
deserved O
. O

and O
going O
back O
again O
to O
one O
of O
your O
iraq B-GPE
collumns O
uh O
you O
observed O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
military O
there O
which O
after O
all O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
increasingly O
shouldering O
the O
burden O
of O
this O
conflict O
. O

the O
slightly O
ragged O
quality O
left O
you O
feeling O
you O
write O
that O
if O
you O
pulled O
the O
us B-GPE
and O
british B-NORP
advisors O
out O
tomorrow B-DATE
the O
whole O
iraqi B-NORP
navy O
would O
collapse O
. O

that O
's O
a O
pretty O
pessimistic O
assessment O
and O
clearly O
at O
odds O
with O
what O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
defense I-ORG
department I-ORG
say O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

. O

not O
at O
odds O
though O
with O
what O
actually O
the O
military O
commanders O
have O
been O
saying O
which O
is O
that O
the O
number O
of O
really O
trained O
iraqi B-NORP
units O
you O
know O
are O
far O
fewer O
than O
than O
sometimes O
suggested O
by O
the O
administration O
. O

so O
you O
're O
saying O
there O
's O
a O
gap O
between O
what O
real O
time O
military O
commanders O
on O
the O
ground O
are O
willing O
to O
tell O
you O
not O
necessarily O
on O
the O
record O
. O

you O
quoted O
one B-CARDINAL
us B-GPE
senior O
official O
and O
what O
the O
president O
of O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
and O
the O
vice O
president O
and O
the O
dis- O
secretary O
of O
defense B-ORG
are O
saying O
to O
reporters O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

are O
we O
calling O
them O
on O
that O
? O

right O
d- O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
enough O
because O
there O
's O
-- O
there O
's O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
happy O
talk O
around O
this O
howie B-PERSON
basically O
. O

and O
a O
lot O
of O
numbers O
are O
thrown O
out O
. O

eighty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
we O
've O
got O
trained O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
twenty I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
next B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

here O
's O
what O
you O
learn O
when O
you O
go O
to O
iraq B-GPE
. O

where O
you O
have O
an O
iraqi B-NORP
commander O
who O
's O
a O
real O
leader O
of O
of O
soldiers O
okay O
you O
have O
a O
unit O
. O

and O
where O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
commander O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
unit O
. O

so O
the O
numbers O
the O
macro O
numbers O
do O
n't O
mean O
anything O
. O

so O
i O
went O
down O
to O
the O
-- O
to O
see O
the O
navy O
there O
. O

the O
navy O
of O
iraq B-GPE
has O
a O
terrific O
commander O
. O

so O
the O
people O
around O
him O
they O
'll O
follow O
him O
into O
battle O
. O

but O
you O
take O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
guy O
out O
there O
's O
no O
iraqi B-NORP
navy O
. O

and O
it O
's O
true O
of O
units O
all O
over O
the O
country O
. O

that O
's O
really O
the O
key O
. O

you O
say O
that O
you O
are O
angry O
uh O
that O
bush B-PERSON
has O
fought O
the O
war O
as O
though O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
. O

are O
you O
particularly O
angry O
as O
somebody O
who O
supported O
the O
war O
and O
took O
heat O
from O
some O
of O
your O
liberal O
friends O
for O
doing O
so O
? O

yes O
. O

absolutely O
because O
i O
believe O
this O
is O
important O
. O

i O
believe O
that O
something O
very O
big O
is O
at O
stake O
. O

we O
're O
dealing O
with O
a O
muslim B-NORP
arab I-NORP
civilization O
right O
now O
that O
's O
that O
's O
in O
decline O
, O
that O
's O
heading O
in O
the O
wrong O
direction O
in O
ways O
that O
are O
dangerous O
for O
them O
and O
i O
believe O
dangerous O
for O
the O
stability O
of O
the O
world O
. O

there O
's O
something O
really O
important O
here O
at O
stake O
. O

and O
what O
makes O
me O
so O
angry O
at O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
is O
not O
that O
they O
did O
n't O
frame O
the O
stakes O
. O

it O
is O
important O
. O

but O
they O
never O
never O
appreciated O
how O
difficult O
it O
was O
. O

they O
never O
prepared O
the O
army O
or O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
for O
how O
difficult O
it O
was O
. O

i O
mentioned O
the O
uh O
devastating O
earthquake O
in O
pakistan B-GPE
a O
region O
you O
're O
familiar O
with O
. O

um O
clearly O
it O
's O
become O
a O
pretty O
big O
story O
. O

but O
for O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
couple I-DATE
days I-DATE
i O
noticed O
it O
was O
n't O
that O
much O
of O
a O
television O
story O
. O

and O
the O
reason O
was O
no O
pictures O
no O
video O
. O

no O
yes O
. O

um O
but O
also O
m- O
maybe O
there O
was O
there O
a O
little O
bit O
less O
coverage O
because O
it O
's O
in O
a O
remote O
part O
of O
the O
world O
? O

uh O
westerners B-NORP
are O
more O
interested O
in O
new B-GPE
orleans I-GPE
than O
in O
pakistan B-GPE
? O

i O
think O
all O
of O
the O
above O
. O

we O
're O
so O
numbed O
also O
after O
katrina B-EVENT
and O
rita B-EVENT
. O

and O
now O
another O
earthquake O
. O

. O

it O
's O
just O
become O
uh O
one B-CARDINAL
natural O
disaster O
after O
another O
. O

to O
hear O
ten B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
forty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
then O
it O
's O
almost O
hard O
for O
a O
journalist O
to O
process O
. O

right O
. O

and O
it O
was O
remote O
. O

and O
people O
are O
exhausted O
i O
think O
both O
viewers O
and O
reporters O
. O

ahead O
have O
new B-ORG

been O
asked O
not O

monster O

more B-CARDINAL

a I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
copies O
better O
than O
any O
book O
you O
've O
ever O
written O
before O
. O

um O
you O
were O
recently O
proto- O
profiled O
about O
this O
in O
fortune B-ORG
magazine O
. O

and O
it O
uh O
pretty O
-- O
uh O
let O
's O
just O
say O
that O
it O
did O
n't O
say O
you O
walked O
on O
water O
but O
it O
came O
close O
. O

uh O
but O
one O
of O
the O
criticisms O
- O

what O
's O
wrong O
with O
that O
? O

it O
says O
that O
you O
're O
the O
composer O
of O
the O
nation O
's O
talking O
points O
which O
was O
news O
to O
me O
. O

uh O
one O
of O
the O
things O
it O
said O
was O
that O
uh O
in O
your O
book O
and O
in O
your O
writing O
that O
ceos O
play O
a O
very O
central O
role O
. O

and O
the O
suggestion O
was O
well O
ceos O
love O
you O
, O
you O
're O
asked O
to O
speak O
at O
all O
these O
corporate O
events O
, O
maybe O
because O
you O
m- O
give O
them O
a O
very O
large O
uh O
share O
of O
the O
narrative O
. O

yeah O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

that O
a O
reasonable O
observation O
? O

yeah O
it O
is O
a O
reasonable O
observation O
. O

and O
my O
reaction O
to O
that O
is O
look O
if O
i O
want O
to O
understand O
the O
underlying O
technology O
that O
is O
flattening O
the O
world O
who O
do O
i O
go O
to O
? O

do O
i O
go O
to O
the O
-- O
do O
i O
go O
to O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
central B-LOC
america I-LOC
? O

do O
i O
go O
to O
um O
uh O
the O
factory O
floor O
? O

or O
do O
i O
go O
to O
the O
innovators O
and O
entrepeneurs O
who O
actually O
put O
all O
this O
together O
? O

so O
i O
make O
no O
apology O
for O
that O
at O
all O
. O

um O
fact O
i O
would O
make O
a O
criticism O
of O
it O
. O

there O
are O
n't O
enough O
people O
during O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
who O
actually O
went O
out O
and O
talked O
to O
the O
innovators O
who O
are O
doing O
all O
of O
these O
things O
who O
are O
actually O
reshaping O
the O
world O
. O

just O
the O
opposite O
. O

we O
kind O
of O
had O
an O
enron B-ORG
effect O
. O

and O
enron B-ORG
effect O
was O
all O
ceos O
are O
guilty O
unless O
proven O
innocent O
, O
therefore O
who O
wants O
to O
talk O
to O
them O
? O

and O
therefore O
i O
would O
argue O
-- O
i O
would O
argue O
-- O
. O

wait O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
. O

wait O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
. O

journalists O
uh O
subscribe O
to O
stereotypes O
because O
there O
are O
a O
few O
crooks O
at O
major O
corporations O
because O
you O
know O
they O
're O
all O
bad O
guys O
? O

yeah O
yeah O
. O

yeah O
i O
w- O
-- O
i O
would O
say O
-- O
i O
would O
say O
. O

that O
's O
a O
-- O
uh O
that O
's O
a O
harsh O
uh O
assessment O
. O

i O
would O
say O
that O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
ignoring O
-- O
there O
's O
several O
things O
happened O
basically O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

i O
would O
call O
it O
a O
poli- O
-- O
a O
perfect O
storm O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
was O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
. O

that O
distracted O
us O
okay O
. O

the O
other O
was O
the O
enron B-ORG
effect O
. O

you O
know O
no O
one O
wanted O
to O
be O
sort O
of O
seen O
with O
ceos O
. O

and O
number B-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
was O
the O
dot O
com O
bust O
which O
made O
everyone O
think O
well O
all O
this O
globalization O
technology O
stuff O
is O
really O
over O
. O

and O
as O
a O
result O
i O
would O
argue O
that O
really O
masked O
what O
is O
actually O
a O
fundemental O
inflection O
point O
the O
flattening O
of O
the O
world O
that O
we O
're O
going O
from O
a O
vertical O
value O
creation O
model O
of O
command O
and O
control O
to O
a O
much O
more O
horizontal O
one O
of O
connect O
and O
collaborate O
. O

the O
argument O
of O
this O
book O
is O
that O
that O
shift O
is O
actually O
going O
to O
be O
as O
big O
-- O
have O
as O
big O
an O
effect O
over O
time O
as O
gutenberg B-PERSON
and O
the O
printing O
press O
. O

and O
i O
would O
argue O
a O
little O
bit O
that O
it O
got O
missed O
because O
of O
all O
these O
other O
distractions O
. O

but O
it O
's O
only O
had O
an O
effect O
on O
tom B-PERSON
friedman I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
career O
. O

in O
fact O
you O
were O
the O
playboy B-ORG
interview O
. O

hey O
put O
that O
paper O
down O
. O

. O

i O
i O
bought O
it O
for O
the O
articles O
. O

uh O
i O
enjoyed O
the O
interview O
. O

and O
you O
said O
in O
there O
that O
your O
wife O
uh O
edits O
all O
your O
columns O
and O
she O
says O
do O
n't O
publish O
it O
. O

yes O
she O
does O
. O

you O
go O
back O
and O
rewrite O
it O
. O

i O
'm O
afraid O
i O
do O
. O

. O

my O
wife O
andrea B-PERSON
edits O
them O
all O
. O

and O
when O
she O
says O
-- O
when O
she O
gives O
me O
thumbs O
down O
howie B-PERSON
i O
have O
to O
put O
it O
in O
a O
ball O
throw O
it O
in O
the O
-- O
in O
the O
circular O
flo- O
file O
and O
start O
over O
. O

and O
she O
's O
a O
tough O
editor O
. O

now O
your O
international O
readership O
on O
the O
new B-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
website O
has O
gone O
down O
because O
of O
this O
new O
experiment O
the O
times B-ORG
has O
where O
it O
costs O
forty B-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
ninety I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
a O
year O
for O
non-subscribers O
at O

to O

times B-ORG
columnists O
. O

that O
's O
got O
to O
be O
disappointing O
for O
you O
. O

you O
know O
it O
's O
-- O
um O
i O
'm O
torn O
. O

uh O
and O
i O
've O
-- O
i O
've O
said O
this O
to O
my O
bosses O
. O

um O
i O
want O
my O
paper O
to O
thrive O
. O

and O
if O
we O
have O
a O
situation O
where O
young O
people O
grow O
up O
in O
the O
world O
that O
thinks O
that O
newspapers O
are O
things O
you O
read O
for O
free O
online O
who O
's O
going O
to O
-- O
who O
's O
going O
to O
pay O
my O
travel O
expenses O
? O

and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
things O
about O
new B-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
online O
is O
i O
got O
to O
reach O
an O
audience O
that O
just O
was O
exponential O
to O
what O
you O
got O
in O
the O
dead O
tree O
edition O
of O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
. O

and O
i O
i O
partic- O
because O
i O
write O
about O
international O
affairs O
so O
i O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
young O
people O
in O
india B-GPE
and O
egypt B-GPE
and O
whatnot O
. O

and O
for O
them O
fifty B-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
that O
may O
be O
their O
-- O
that O
may O
be O
their O
tuition O
for O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

so O
i O
i O
'm O
honestly O
torn O
. O

i O
really O
hope O
this O
works O
because O
i O
want O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
to O
have O
a O
platform O
that O
is O
sustainable O
. O

but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
i O
hope O
we O
can O
eventually O
find O
a O
way O
to O
re-engage O
those O
people O
because O
definitely O
we O
've O
lost O
some O
of O
them O
. O

eh O
in O
the O
valerie B-PERSON
plame I-PERSON
leak O
investigation O
there O
's O
an O
allegation O
bouncing O
around O
the O
blogosphere O
that O
i O
just O
thought O
i O
would O
address O
with O
you O
which O
is O
that O
-- O
have O
new B-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
columnists O
somehow O
been O
told O
not O
to O
write O
about O
this O
because O
of O
judy B-PERSON
miller I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
involvement O
and O
being O
in O
jail O
, O
now O
being O
out O
of O

. O

absol- O
absolutely O
not O
. O

anybody O
tell O
you O
not O
to O
write O
about O
it O
? O

i O
mean O
they O
do O
n't O
tell O
me O
not O

about O
anything O
. O

i O
howie O
we O

that O

so O
um O
- O

did O
you O
even O
tell O
the O

? O

that O
's O
right O
. O
so O
there O
there O
there O
's O
no O

why O
why O
people O
have O
n't O
written O

i O

i O
'm O
focused O

a O

we O
do O
n't O
know O
obviously O
about O
the O

but O
why O
do O
you O

after O
all O
whether O
you O

but O
safety O
is O

not O
too O
big O
of O
a O

. O

the O
collision O
happened O
on O
the O
side O

. O

so O
, O
the O
side O

fully O

they O

at O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
collision O
was O
with O
the O
protective O
fence O
only O
, O
and O
the O
impact O
on O
the O
people O
was O
very O
small O
. O

in O
addition O
, O
there O
was O
the O
protection O
of O
the O
air O
curtain O
. O

so O
, O
there O
would O
surely O
not O
be O
a O
big O
problem O
. O

the O
real O
fatal O
collision O
was O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
one O
from O
the O
tailgating O
truck O
. O

at O
that O
time O
, O
all O
the O
airbags O
were O
already O
deflated O
. O

there O
was O
no O
protective O
effect O
. O

furthermore O
, O
the O
force O
of O
this O
one O
was O
extremely O
large O
. O

if O
the O
car O
had O
been O
stopped O
at O
an O
angle O
, O
then O
the O
head O
of O
the O
person O
sitting O
on O
one O
side O
would O
surely O
have O
hit O
the O
glass O
or O
the O
b O
column O
. O

meanwhile O
, O
there O
would O
not O
have O
been O
too O
much O
of O
a O
problem O
for O
someone O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

this O
is O
common O
knowledge O
. O

then O
it O
came O
down O
to O
who O
had O
the O
bad O
luck O
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
car O
that O
was O
angled O
out O
. O

it O
was O
perfectly O
correct O
for O
the O
front O
airbag O
not O
to O
open O
, O
because O
the O
front O
of O
the O
car O
was O
not O
damaged O
at O
all O
. O

none O
of O
the O
sensors O
received O
any O
signal O
of O
a O
collision O
. O

just O
imagine O
, O
this O
was O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

the O
people O
went O
backward O
abruptly O
. O

their O
bodies O
could O
have O
been O
supported O
by O
the O
seats O
, O
but O
the O
impact O
on O
their O
necks O
and O
heads O
was O
tremendous O
. O

when O
they O
went O
abruptly O
backward O
, O
any O
additional O
misfortune O
of O
the O
front O
airbag O
opening O
for O
no O
reason O
would O
have O
eliminated O
any O
chance O
of O
survival O
. O

so O
, O
of O
all O
the O
cars O
in O
the O
world O
, O
even O
a O
rolls B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
royce I-PRODUCT
, O
the O
front O
airbag O
will O
not O
open O
during O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

if O
the O
front O
airbag O
opened O
after O
being O
tailgated O
, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
quality O
problem O
, O
and O
would O
be O
extremely O
dangerous O
. O

the O
safety O
airbag O
's O
eruption O
could O
knock O
someone O
to O
death O
. O

so O
, O
infants O
are O
strictly O
forbidden O
from O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
seat O
. O

that O
was O
how O
the O
whole O
accident O
took O
place O
. O

the O
result O
of O
the O
accident O
investigation O
division O
will O
not O
be O
different O
from O
this O
. O

for O
this O
kind O
of O
accident O
, O
conclusions O
can O
be O
drawn O
from O
a O
single O
glance O
at O
the O
car O
wreckage O
. O

the O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
have O
no O
fault O
. O

all O
of O
the O
car O
's O
passive O
safety O
protections O
had O
already O
fully O
carried O
out O
their O
functions O
. O

so O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
ridiculous O
and O
unscientific O
to O
blame O
and O
suspect O
the O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
for O
such O
an O
accident O
. O

in O
particular O
, O
speculation O
about O
why O
the O
front O
airbags O
did O
not O
open O
was O
very O
amateurish O
. O

only O
by O
not O
opening O
would O
it O
have O
been O
correct O
. O

if O
they O
had O
opened O
, O
her O
assistant O
might O
still O
be O
lying O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O

if O
an O
accident O
occurs O
on O
the O
freeway O
, O
please O
get O
out O
of O
the O
car O
and O
leave O
immediately O
if O
you O
can O
move O
. O

many O
freeway O
accidents O
occur O
simply O
because O
people O
stay O
inside O
the O
car O
and O
sort O
out O
their O
thoughts O
, O
following O
which O
there O
is O
a O
fatal O
crash O
from O
a O
car O
following O
behind O
. O

about O
death O
, O
i O
have O
always O
believed O
that O
they O
do O
not O
leave O
the O
world O
. O

they O
only O
leave O
the O
human O
world O
. O

they O
are O
surely O
sharing O
the O
same O
world O
with O
us O
, O
with O

it O

every O

how O

we O

that O

the O

the B-GPE

how O

it O

when O

with O

many O

so O
instead O

they O

healthy O

are O

well O
they O
're O
just O

you O
have O
to O
remember O
this O
company O
was O
a O
very O
closed O
uh O

really O
s- O
founded O
by O
sam B-PERSON
walton I-PERSON

he O

he O
did O

he O
did O
n't O
believe O
in O
pr O
. O

he O
said O
all O
we O
need O
to O
do O
was O
open O

up O
and O
offer O

at O

. O

they O
're O
starting O
to O
realize O
that O
they O
need O

respond O
more O
and O
more O
. O

so O
they O
're O
just O
getting O
up O
to O
speed O
. O

but O
i O
think O
you O
're O
right O
. O

they O
should O
get O
out O
there O
and O
tell O
their O
side O
of O
the O

. O

is O
this O
going O
to O
be O
a O
big O

for O
them O
? O

no O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
big O
hit O
because O
there O
're O
other O
things O
out O
there O
. O

you O
know O
there O
's O
a O
negative O
documentary O

there O
's O
maybe O
a O

out O
there O
as O

they O

and O
a O

of O
people O
like O
to O

i O
mean O
they O
would O
n't O
be O
a O

to O
some O

if O
they O

n't O

you O

i O
think O
you O
look O
at O
the O
totality O
of O
his O

and O
what O
you O
see O
is O
a O
judge O
squarely O
within O

wasserstein B-PERSON
is O
a O
liberal O

except O
when O

and O
he O
is O
not O
alone O
. O

he O
's O
hired O
liberals O

and O
all O
i O
know O
is O
that O
we O
're O
all O
unanimously O
supporting O
the O

for O
his O
i- O

in O
his O

the O
kind O
of O
testimony O
that O
may O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
people O
like O

not O
even O
a O

nelson B-PERSON

to O

keeps O

the O

this O

the O

itself O
into O

. O

you O
read O
this O

and O
you O
think O
wow O
this O
is O
somebody O
who O
killed O
three B-CARDINAL
people O
? O

do O
you O
believe O
that O
that O
murderers O
can O
be O
reformed O
? O

is O
this O
man O
healthy O
? O

if O
he O
were O
to O
walk O
the O
streets O
again O
would O
he O
never O
kill O
again O
? O

w- O
we O
're O
not O
talking O
about O
letting O
him O
out O
of O
prison O
. O

we O
're O
talking O
about O
clemency O
to O
give O
him O
life O
without O
parole O
where O
we O
do O
n't O
kill O
him O
. O

and O
i O
have O
already O
made O
some O
uh O
efforts O
to O
put O
him O
into O
a O
particular O
program O
where O
he O
would O
uh O
be O
effective O
. O

one O
of O
the O
major O
prob- O
gang O
problems O
uh O
w- O
of O
the O
insanity O
of O

is O
young O
black O

young O

tookie B-PERSON
- O

right O

and O
tookie B-PERSON
has O
come O
up O
with O
some O
interesting O
observations O
about O
why O
this O
goes O
on O
as O
- O

uh O
they O
're O
good O
enough O
to O
put O
in O
my O
theoretical O
book O
on O
on O
gangsters O
. O

and O
i O
think O
he O
could O
be O
very O
effective O
in O
a O
program O
. O

and O
as O
i O
've O
indicated O
i O
've O
already O
talked O
to O
the O
director O
of O
uh O
of O
a O
program O
in O
the O
california B-GPE
prison O
system O
. O

and O
if O
governor O
schwarzenegger B-PERSON
really O
means O
what O
he O
says O
about O
uh O
the B-ORG
california I-ORG
department I-ORG
of I-ORG
corrections I-ORG
with O
emphasis O
on O
corrections O
and O
rehabilitation O
he O
should O
spare O

. O

but O
- O

he O
's O
really O
the O
only O
one O
who O
can O
do O
it O
. O

and O
as O
i O
've O
- O

well O

what O

you O

uh O
some O

perhaps O
should O
get O

this O

a O

lora B-PERSON

the O
answer O

is O
he O
? O

no O
he O
does O
n't O
do O
any O

our O

to O
basically O

when O
the O

president O

was O
so O
scared O
that O
the O
shah O

would O
blame O
him O
for O

him O
out O

make O
way O
for O
the O
ayatollah O
that O
he O
declared O

mr. O

he O
would O
go O

but O
that O
ghost O
would O
n't O
settle O
for O

he O
wanted O
money O

lots O

so O
mr. O
carter B-PERSON
formed O
three B-CARDINAL
new O
army B-ORG
divisions O

gave O
them O
to O
a O
new O
bureaucracy O
in O

called O
the B-ORG
rapid I-ORG

that O

he O
knew O
the O

neither O

it O

after O

i O

it O
made O

why O

he O

suddenly O

one B-TIME

both O

together O
caught O

threw O
him O

before O

marshall B-PERSON

someday O

they O

they O
had O

moving O

it O
turned O

all O

but O
the O
shah O
still O
kept O
leaping O
out O
at O
cap B-PERSON

so O
cap B-PERSON
bought O
a B-CARDINAL

$ B-MONEY
7 I-MONEY

that O
those O
seven B-CARDINAL

could O

then O
suddenly O

the O

all O

shows O
that O

another O

. O

no O

or O

after O

the B-ORG

adopted O
two B-CARDINAL
specific O

: O
if O
the O

250 B-CARDINAL

400 B-CARDINAL
points O
, O
the O

will O
close O
for O
an O
additional O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

the O
rationale O
is O
that O
an O

allow O

, O
calm O

it O
is O
impossible O

that O

a O
temporary O

may O
indeed O
discourage O
a O
selling O
panic O
from O
feeding O

itself O
. O

but O
there O
is O
also O
the O
possibility O
that O
shutting O

intensify O
fears O

cause O
an O
even O
more O

china B-GPE

in O
my O
view O

the O

in O

we O
clearly O
felt O
that O
the O
behavior O

the O

went O
beyond O
enforcement O

their O
behavior O
infringed O
on O

for O
example O
, O
when O
the O

between O
the O

the O

, O
" O
one O

took O
out O
a O

me O
; O
i O
used O
my O

to O
block O

, O
and O
another O
policeman O
kicked O
me O
in O
the O
stomach O
. O

i O
immediately O
squatted O
down O
, O
and O
then O
they O
beat O
me O
on O
the O
face O
and O
head O
, O
i O
do O

know O
who O
it O
was O
; O
i O
wiped O
my O
face O
with O
my O
hand O
, O
my O
hand O
was O
full O
of O
blood O
, O
they O
had O
broken O
open O
my O

. O
" O

although O
the O
peasants O
' O

the O
road O
was O
against O
the O
law O
, O
the O
police O
can O
maintain O
order O

but O
what O

the O

have O

even O
to O
kick O
a O

" O

it O
also O
might O
be O
said O
that O
when O
a O
mob O
situation O
arises O
the O
police O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
clash O
with O
the O
people O
; O
most O
often O
the O

are O
following O
orders O

suppress O
the O
mob O
and O
help O

restore O
order O

in O
life O
, O
some O
local O
government O

encounter O
problems O

fierce O
resistance O
from O

people O
; O
instead O
of O
thinking O
of O
ways O
to O
smooth O

resolve O
the O

, O
they O
first B-ORDINAL
think O
of O

they O
're O
accustomed O
to O
mobilizing O
the O
police O
force O
to O
forcefully O
carry O
that O
out O
. O

in O
fact O
the O
harsher O
the O
suppression O
the O
more O
likely O
there O
will O
be O
a O
conflict O
, O
bringing O
on O
even O
greater O
feelings O
of O
opposition O
between O

and O
between O

and O
the O
masses O
, O
which O
does O

. O

taking O
this O
case O
as O
an O
example O
, O
the O
common O
folk O
blocked O
the O

because O
the O
local O
government O
did O
not O
resolve O
the O
problem O
. O

if O
it O
had O
resolved O
it O
, O
no O
one O
would O
have O
broken O
the O
law O
! O

although O
you O
can O
say O
that O
blocking O
the O
road O
was O
illegal O
, O
it O
's O
also O
not O
a O
violent O
act O
; O
the O
police O
should O
have O
continued O
directing O
traffic O
, O
and O
they O
might O
not O
have O
resorted O
so O
quickly O
to O
force O
. O

who O
brought O
about O
the O
clash O
between O
the O
police O
and O
the O
villagers O
? O

who O
bears O
responsibility O
?! O

i O
believe O
we O
should O
first B-ORDINAL
look O
into O
the O
local O
government O
's O
nonfeasance O
in O
ignoring O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
people O
. O

" O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
masses O
are O
no O
small O
matter O
" O
is O
not O
just O
a O
slogan O
; O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
made O
real O
. O

now O
that O
there O
has O
been O
this O
disturbance O
, O
the O
concerned O
parties O
need O
to O
be O
vigilant O
; O
they O
take O
the O
initiative O
and O
pay O
compensation O
for O
the O
reinforcement O
work O
, O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O
. O

the O
reason O
is O
very O
simple O
: O
people O
's O
homes O
, O
which O
were O
originally O
unstable O
, O
can O
still O
be O
maintained O
for O
several B-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
; O
this O
shock O
was O
n't O
caused O
by O
the O
people O
, O
and O
compensation O
should O
be O
paid O
. O

moreover O
, O
it O
is O
useless O
to O
quibble O
further O
about O
how O
much O
money O
should O
be O
spent O
on O
the O
compensation O
issue O
. O

i O
believe O
there O
is O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
standard O
: O
if O
someone O
's O
house O
was O
destroyed O
, O
the O
party O
who O
destroyed O
it O
should O
restore O
it O
to O
its O
original O
condition O
, O
without O
regard O
to O
how O
much O
money O
the O
damage O
is O
worth O
, O
afraid O
to O
spend O
one B-MONEY
red I-MONEY
cent I-MONEY
; O
just O
restore O
it O
to O
the O
original O
condition O
. O

if O
the O
wrangling O
over O
the O
compensation O
issue O
goes O
on O
forever O
, O
then O
i O
believe O
the O
government O
is O
still O
not O
sincere O
in O
resolving O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
people O
's O
interests O
; O
if O
it O
drags O
on O
and O
on O
, O
it O
will O
only O
intensify O
the O

make O

, O
said O
the O
price O
action O
for O
all O
of O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
is O
the O
best O
he O
has O
seen O
on O
a O
weekly B-DATE
basis O
in O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

he O
said O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
's I-DATE
activity O
in O
gold O
could O
portend O
a O
move O
to O
$ O
390 B-MONEY
an O

for O

. O

he O
also O
said O
traders O
should O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
because O
`` O
if O
the O
stock O
market O
rallies O
, O
that O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O
the O
precious O

'' O

he O
said O
traders O
should O
be O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
how O

react O
to O
this O

. O

`` O
i O
expect O

see O
some O

will O
they O
kill O

they O
have O
every O

he O
noted O
that O
for O

there O
was O
some O
light O

interest O
in O
the O

grains O
and O
soybeans O

prices O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
will O
likely O
be O
dominated O
by O
reports O
on O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
corn O
and O
soybean O
harvest O
as O
well O
as O
by O
speculation O
about O
more O
purchases O
of O
u.s. B-GPE
crops O
by O
the B-GPE
soviet I-GPE
union I-GPE
. O

in O
recent B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
warm O
and O
dry O
weather O
has O
sped O
the O
midwest B-LOC
harvest O
and O
that O
is O
permitting O
farmers O
to O
rebuild O
the O
stockpiles O
that O
were O
cut O
by O
the O
1988 B-DATE
drought O
. O

if O
the O
weather O
allowed O
farmers O
to O
work O
in O
their O
fields O
over O
the B-DATE
weekend I-DATE
, O
many O
midwest B-LOC
grain O
elevators O

probably O
sell O

today B-DATE
at O
the B-ORG
chicago I-ORG
board I-ORG
of I-ORG
trade I-ORG
in O
order O
to O
hedge O
their B-DATE
weekend I-DATE
purchases O
from O
farmers O
. O

that O
selling O
of O
futures O
contracts O
by O
elevators O
is O
what O
helps O
keep O
downward O
pressure O
on O
crop O
prices O
during O
the O
harvest O
. O

traders O
will O
also O
watch O
for O
whether O
the B-GPE
soviet I-GPE
union I-GPE
continues O
its O
traditional O
fall O
buying O
of O
u.s. B-GPE
grain O
. O

so O
far O
this B-DATE
month I-DATE
, O
the O

have O
bought O
about B-QUANTITY
7.2 I-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
metric I-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
of O
u.s. B-GPE
corn O
. O

there O
may O
be O
some O
activity O
in O
soybean O
prices O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
as O
investors O
try O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
contract O
for O
november B-DATE
delivery O
. O

investors O
usually O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
take O
physical O
delivery O
of O
a O
contract O
, O
preferring O
instead O
to O
profit O
from O
its O
price O
swings O
and O
then O
end O
any O
obligation O
to O
take O
delivery O

there O
was O
a O

in O

, O
who O
encouraged O

, O
reasonable O

healthy O
way O

by O
reading O
professional O
books O

the O
most O
important O
aspect O
in O
being O
your O

is O
to O
learn O
to O
substitute O
the O
healthy O
way O
of O

for O
the O
unhealthy O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O

for O
example O
, O
ask O
two B-CARDINAL
people O
to O
observe O
the O
same O
glass O
, O
if O
one O
notices O
a O
tiny O
speckle O
and O
the O
other O
notices O
the O
mild O
color O
, O
then O
the O
former O
's O
thinking O
pattern O
might O
be O
pessimistic O
, O
while O
the O
latter O
might O
be O
more O
sensitive O
to O
the O
positive O
aspect O
of O
things O
, O
which O
is O
a O
healthy O
and O
optimistic O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O

thus O
, O
learn O
to O
observe O
the O
positive O
aspect O
of O
things O
has O
become O
an O
important O
training O
. O

to O
be O
your O
own O
psychiatrist O
, O
you O
should O
also O
learn O
to O
observe O
stress O

for O
example O
, O
if O
you O
have O
a O

your O

through O

you O

the O
reason O

your O

to O

" O
all O

have O
beautiful O

" O

it O

have O
stated O
that O
the O
2000 B-DATE
election O

has O
three B-CARDINAL
special O
characteristics O
: O

for O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
this O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
the O

a O
very O
real O
possibility O

secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
leading O
candidates O
are O
so O
close O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
tell O
who O
will O
win O

and O
third B-ORDINAL
, O
whatever O
the O
outcome O
, O
this O
is O
the O
beginning O
of O
taiwan B-GPE

post-strongman O
era O

in O
this O

, O
says O
wang B-PERSON
, O
new O
standards O
for O

are O
needed O

the O

be O
more O

just O
a O

wang B-PERSON

his O
personal O
analysis O

the O
pros O

for O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
candidates O
: O

chen B-PERSON
shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian I-PERSON
is O
the O
person O
who O
brings O
the O
most O
hope O

because O

policies O

be O
clearly O
different O

his O
biggest O

- O
not O
personal O

instability O

for O
example O
, O
sometimes O

sometimes O
in O

sometimes O

sometimes O
not O

james B-PERSON

his O
very O
success O
may O
be O
his O
weak O
point O
. O

he O
is O
often O
very O
proud O
of O
himself O
because O

that O
, O
although O

unfortunately O
, O
the O
effects O

visible O
only O
in O
the O

and O
it O
therefore O
has O
a O
relatively O
weak O
position O
in O

is O
often O
neglected O
because O

probably O
will O
not O
see O
the O

such O

little O
bit O
about O
the O
day O
she O
was O
born O
. O

when O
did O
you O
first O
see O
her O
? O

%um O
what O
happened O
is O
we O
went O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O

she O
was O
induced O
. O

mhm O
. O

so O
we O
get O
a O
phone O
call O

and O
th- O
, O
she O
was O
supposed O
to O
right O
finally O
. O
%um O
the O
birth O
mom O
was O
supposed O
to O
go O
in O
at O
%um O
, O
it O
's O
my O
thinking O
that O
this O
will O
be O
distributed O
publicly O
. O
right O
. O
at O
%um O
six B-TIME
thirty I-TIME
in O
the O
morning O

but O
she O
called O

and O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
beds O
. O

oh O
no O
. O

so O
she O
called O
us O
and O
told O
us O
that O
, O

but O
then O
they O
did O
get O
a O
bed O

and O
she O
went O
in O
at O
eight B-TIME
. O
mhm O
. O
or O
seven B-TIME
thirty I-TIME
or O
, O

i O
guess O
she O
went O
in O
at O
seven B-TIME
thirty I-TIME

and O
they O
started O
her O
at O
eight B-TIME
or O

so O
so O
we O
hopped O
in O
the O
car O
and O
drove O
down O
to O
be O
there O
mhm O
. O
%mm O
mhm O
. O
for O
the O
day O
. O

mhm O
. O

and O
%um O
, O
we O
hung O
out O
all O
day O
. O

we O
had O
%uh O
we O
had O
some O
difficult O
times O
with O
the O
lawyer O
down O
there O
. O

he O
was O
supposed O
to O
show O
up O

%mm O

mhm O
. O

and O
we O
waited O
all O
day O

and O
he O
never O
bloody O
showed O
up O
. O

oh O
no O
. O

and O
%um O
, O
he O
and O
also O
she O
was O
expecting O
him O
too O
. O
mhm O
. O
you O
know O

and O
so O
that O
was O
frustrating O
. O

yeah O
. O

but O
anyway O
we O
waited O
all O
day O

and O
%um O
but O
then O
five B-TIME
twenty I-TIME
five I-TIME
mae B-PERSON
was O
born O
. O

right O
. O

and O
the O
birth O
mother O
's O
mother O
was O
with O
her O
through O
the O
whole O
thing O

and O
she O
was O
fantastic O
. O

she O
was O
just O
great O
. O

she O
was O
so O
nice O
to O
us O
and O
so O
solid O
there O
for O
her O
daughter O
and O
just O
a O
wonderful O
uh-huh O
. O
mhm O
. O
woman O
person O

and O
%um O
she O
was O
great O
. O

she O
came O
out O
, O
you O
know O
, O
a O
couple O
times O
during O
the O
day O

she O
came O
out O
and O
gave O
us O
little O
progress O
reports O
of O
how O
things O
were O
going O

and O
actually O
it O
was O
very O
funny O
uh-huh O
. O
because O
the O
first O
time O
she O
out O
, O

i O
mean O
here O
we O
're O
out O
there O
sort O
of O
ringing O
our O
hands O
and O
uh-huh O
. O
sweating O
it O
out O
and O
wondering O
how O
everybody O
is O
going O
and O
everything O

and O
she O
came O
out O

and O
could O
i O
go O
downstairs O
because O
%um O
, O
her O
daughter O
wanted O
playing O
cards O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
i O
guess O
she O
was O
bored O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

you O
know O
passing O
the O
time O

so O
i O
went O
downstairs O
to O
get O
playing O

with O
her O

and O
uh-huh O
. O
and O
then O
later O
on O
she O
came O
out O

and O
she O
wanted O
some O
chewing O
gum O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

%um O
, O
i O
guess O
your O
mouth O
gets O
dry O

and O
you O
just O
want O
something O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
'm O
sure O
. O

, O
it O

yeah O
. O

and O
%um O
, O
then O
but O
they O
kind O
of O
held O
her O
back O
. O

i O
think O
the O
baby O
would O
've O
born O
, O
been O
born O
sooner O

but O
the O
doctor O
did O
n't O
get O

i O
thought O

there O
was O
like O
no O
stopping O
it O
. O

no O
they O
can O
hold O
you O
back O
%hm O
. O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
you O
know O
. O

%hm O
. O

once O
, O

depends O
how O
much O
stuff O
they O
give O
you O
. O

how O
much O
stuff O
they O
give O
you O
. O

yeah O
. O

stuff O

but O
anyway O
i O
think O
they O
were O
holding O
her O
back O
a O
little O
bit O
because O
they O
wanted O
the O
doctor O
there O
. O

mhm O

uh-huh O
. O

%um O
, O
and O
the O
doctor O
showed O
up O
around B-TIME
three I-TIME

and O
mae B-PERSON
was O
born O
at O
five B-TIME
twenty I-TIME
five I-TIME
. O

mhm O

and O
i O
, O

and O
%um O

, O

that O
's O
right O
. O

her O
mom O
came O
running O
out O
to O
tell O
us O
the O

bit O
worn O
. O

but O
she O
's O
got O
a O
nice O

and O
, O
you O

%um O
, O

you O

mhm O
. O

but O
did O
you O
get O

see O
her O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME

or O

a- O

well O

, O
there O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
%um O
delivery O
nurse O
who O
we O
had O
spoken O
to O
earlier O
in O
the O
day O
named O
tina B-PERSON
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

and O
what O
they O
do O
is O
they O
take O
the O
baby O
from O
the O
delivery O
room O
to O
the O
nursery O
. O

mhm O
. O

normally O
they O
go O
directly O

and O
tina B-PERSON
very O
, O
very O
sweetly O
zipped O
past O
the O

to O
the O
out O
, O
outer O
part O
of O
the O
nursery O
where O
we O
were O

mhm O
outside O

and O
let O

we O
held O
her O
for O
just O
a O
couple B-TIME

robert B-PERSON
. O

. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

instant O
. O

she O
just O
stopped O
screaming O
immediately O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
he O
held O
her O
for O
a O
little O
while O
. O

and O
then O
the O
nurse O
was O
afraid O
to O
take O
her O
back O
. O

said O
oh O
she O
's O
going O

uh- O

and O
she O
did O

uh-huh O

and O
off O
they O
went O
to O
the O
nursery O

and O
then O
you O
watched O
through O
the O
glass O

that O
must O
have O
been O
very O
reassuring O
for O
robert B-PERSON
. O

it O
was O
very O
nice O
was O
n't O
it O
. O

it O
was O
very O
wonderful O
for O
robert B-PERSON
and O
for O
me O
too O
just O
to O
see O
, O

i O
knew O
it O
would O
work O
too O
. O

very O
nice O
. O

yeah O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
is O
. O

he O
has O
some O
, O

you O
have O
a O
theory O
. O

body O
warmth O
or O
something O

but O
anyway O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
think O
it O
's O
partly O
it O

but O
there O
're O
certain O
kind O
of O
men O
who O
, O

i O
think O
it O
's O
men O
who O
have O
like O
these O
big O

i O
have O
this O
theory O
that O
it O
's O
men O
who O
are O
very O
broad O
right O
under O
the O
elbow O
you O
know O
like O
, O

wait O
a O
minute O
. O

broad O
under O
the O
elbow O
. O

you O
mean O
in O
the O
chest O
? O

like O

no O
. O

from O
the O
elbow O
down O
towards O
the O
wrist O
. O

oh O
. O

who O
have O
like O
these O
big O
broad O
forearms O
. O

i O
think O
babies O
like O
that O
. O

you O
think O
it O
gives O
, O
it O
gives O
security O
. O

i O
suppose O
. O

do O
you O
remember O
otto B-PERSON
who O
moved O
my O
filing O
cabinet O
that O
time O
in O
philadelphia B-GPE

he O
's O
another O
one O
? O
yes O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
yeah O
. O
he O
's O
big O
. O
he O
's O
sort O
of O
solid O
to O
me O
. O
who O

he O
's O
sort O
of O
very O
solid O

and O
they O
just O
love O
it O
. O

but O
robert B-PERSON
's O
not O
big O
like O
that O
. O

no O
, O

but O
he O
, O
but O
robert B-PERSON
is O
big O
below O
the O
elbows O
i O
'll O
bet O
if O
you O
check O
. O

i O
'll O
have O
to O
check O
out O
below O
robert B-PERSON
's O
elbows O

at O
any O
rate O
, O
%um O

so O
that O
was O
nice O

and O
then O
we O
watched O
through O
the O
nursery O
while O
they O
do O
, O

if O
you O
survive O
the O
first O
four O
hours O
of O
life O
in O
the O
nursery O
you O
'll O
survive O
anything O
after O
. O

it O
's O
the O
most O
sort O
of O
appalling O
introduction O
to O
life O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

but O
i O
was O
kind O
of O
scared O
at O
that O
point O
because O
we O
're O
looking O
in O
and O
there O
're O
all O
these O
nice O
sweet O
little O
pale O
babies O
lying O
there O
limp O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
there O
's O
mae B-PERSON

and O
she O
's O
big O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O

and O
she O
was O
bright O
red O

and O
she O
is O
screaming O

and O
she O
screamed O

and O
she O
screamed O

and O
she O
screamed O

and O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
them O
as O
soon O
as O
they O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

um O
- O
huh O

uh-huh O

they O
sort O
of O
get O
exhausted O
after O
two B-CARDINAL
screams O
and O
collapse O
. O

yeah O
. O

and O
she O
was O
healthy O
i O
guess O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
she O
just O
screamed O
and O
screamed O
and O
screamed O
and O
screamed O
and O
screamed O

and O
i O
thought O
oh O
my O
god O
what O
have O
we O
wrought O
here O
. O

did O
they O
tell O
you O
her O
apgar O
or O
whatever O
they O
call O
that O
? O

how O

they O
did O
n't O
tell O
us O
anything O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
at O
the O
hospital O
they O
were O
n't O
the O
, O
there O
were O
someth- O
, O
the O
individual O
people O
we O
had O
contact O
with O
were O
, O
were O
decent O
to O
us O
and O
friendly O

were O
nice O
. O

but O
%um O
the O
hospital O
policy O
was O
rather O
unfriendly O
to O
us O

and O
they O
would O
n't O
, O

like O
we O
had O
been O
told O
, O

we O
they O
have O
a O
room O
called O
the O
bonding O
room O

yeah O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
the O
whole O
purpose O
of O
the O
room O
is O
to O
let O
people O
be O
in O
it O
with O
the O
baby O
, O
who O
-- O
uh-huh O
. O
-- O
are O
going O
to O
be O
with O
the O
baby O
. O

right O
. O

and O
they O
would O
n't O
let O
us O
in O
there O

so O
, O
%mm O
. O
d- O
, O
it O
was O
really O
quite O
awful O
. O

they O
would O
n't O
let O
us O
, O

they O
did O
n't O
, O

they O
they O
gave O
us O

but O
they O
did O
n't O
tell O
us O
beans O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
mean O
they O
really O
did O
n't O
talk O
to O
us O
. O

they O
did O
n't O
offer O
us O
that O
parenting O
class O
that O
they O
offer O
to O
most O
people O
. O

mhm O
. O

we O
would O
have O
had O
to O
come O
back O
the O
next O
day O
to O
the O
hospital O
which O
of O
course O
we O
were O
n't O
going O
to O
do O
. O

%hm O
. O

mhm O
. O

%um O
, O
you O
know O
they O
really O
were O
n't O
very O
nice O

and O
yeah O
. O
i O
guess O
they O
have O
, O

their O
rules O
are O
just O
very O
rigid O
. O

%mm O
. O

and O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
lawyer O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
arranged O
for O
%um O
right O
. O
an O
additional O
bracelet O
. O

mhm O
. O

in O
other O
words O
, O
what O
happens O
is O
they O
put O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
the O
wrist O
of O
the O
baby O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
the O
ankle O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
the O
birth O
mother O

and O
then O
she O
has O
a O
, O
what O
you O
call O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
bracelet O
which O
she O
can O
give O
to O
whoever O
will O
be O
her O
coach O
through O
the O
birth O
and O
stuff O

and O
of O
course O
she O
had O
given O
it O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
%hm O
. O
mhm O
. O
%hm O
. O
i O
see O
. O
i O
see O
. O
which O
makes O

so O
the O
only O
way O
that O
they O
would O

was O
to O

would O
n't O
ask O
and O
which O
she O
would O

do O

was O

eh O
, O
well O
, O
president O
putin B-PERSON
and O
prime O
minister O
koizumi B-PERSON
, O
ah O
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
talked O
for O
a O
total O
of O
two B-TIME
and I-TIME
a I-TIME
half I-TIME
hours I-TIME
and O
signed O
a O
total O
of O
12 B-CARDINAL

. O

it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
quite O
a O
large O
number O
of O
documents O
were O
signed O
. O

however O
, O
the O
general O
reaction O
from O
scholars O
, O
media O
, O
or O
ordinary O
people O
here O
, O
er O
, O
is O
rather O
low O
key O
, O
because O
, O
er O
, O
there O
has O
been O
no O
progress O
on O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
issues O
that O
japan B-GPE
is O
relatively O
concerned O
with O
, O
the O
northern B-LOC
territories I-LOC
issue O
, O
er O
, O
and O
the O
oil O
pipeline O
route O
issue O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

regarding O
the O
northern B-LOC
territories I-LOC
issue O
, O
this O
russian O
, O
er O
, O
president O
putin B-PERSON
purposely O
avoided O
this O
issue O
, O
that O
is O
, O
he O
did O
not O
really O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
there O
has O
still O
been O
no O
progress O
on O
territorial O
issues O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
abandoned O
plans O
for O
a O
joint O
declaration O
. O

well O
, O
on O
the O
oil O
pipeline O
route O
issue O
, O
though O
the O
russian B-NORP
side O
promised O
to O
connect O
it O
with O
japan B-GPE
, O
there O
was O
no O
talk O
about O
prioritizing O
a O
connection O
with O
japan B-GPE
. O

the O
media O
here O
is O
concerned O
because O
russia B-GPE
already O
promised O
to O
prioritize O
connecting O
it O
with O
china B-GPE
, O
er O
, O
%pw O
, O
so O
the O
media O
here O
is O
concerned O
that O
it O
is O
an O
empty O
promise O
. O

in O
this O
way O
, O
japan B-GPE
may O
not O
get O
, O
er O
, O
any O
material O
benefit O
, O
while O
the O
russian B-NORP
side O
will O
have O
gained O
japan B-GPE

support O
for O
its O
wto B-ORG
accession O

er O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
at O
the O
business B-ORG

meeting O
, O
russian B-NORP
president O
putin B-PERSON
urged O
the O
japanese B-NORP
business O
community O
to O
invest O
in O
russia B-GPE
. O

however O
, O
due O
to O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
or O
little O
progress O
on O
the O
territorial O

, O
along O
with O
the O
business O

concerns O
with O
the O

in O

, O
well O
, O
it O
remains O
a O
big O
question O
how O
far O
economic O
cooperation O
can O
go O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

host O
. O

this O
was O
the O
main O
content O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
leaders O
' O
talks O
today B-DATE
. O

well O
, O
what O
kind O
of O
response O
did O
people O
in O
japan B-GPE
have O
to O
some O
of O
the O
achievements O
putin O
made O
during O
his O
trip O
to O
japan O
, O
well O
, O
some O
of O
the O
achievements O
this O
trip O
to O
japan B-GPE
has O
made O
? O

er O
, O
it O
is O
still O
rather O
, O
er O
, O
low O
key O
. O

because O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
ah O
, O
er O
, O
we O
also O
saw O
, O
er O
, O
in O
tokyo B-GPE
, O
some O
right O
- O
wing O
groups O
held O
demonstrations O
, O
demanding O
that O
russia B-GPE
return O
, O
return O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

well O
, O
they O
are O
also O
extremely O
dissatisfied O
because O
no O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

well O
, O
both O
the O
media O
and O
citizens O
have O
such O
concerns O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
they O
are O
afraid O
that O
resolution O
of O
territorial O
issues O
may O
take O
rather O
. O

host O
. O

okay O
, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
, O
professor O
wang B-PERSON
, O
for O
briefing O
us O
on O
the O
relevant O
information O
in O
japan B-GPE
. O

thank O
you O
! O

well O
, O
next O
we O
will O
return O
to O
the O
studio O
to O
interview O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
experts O
in O
the O
studio O
. O

just O
now O
, O
this O
professor O
wang B-PERSON
talked O
about O
putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
this O
time O
. O

although O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
signed O
12 B-CARDINAL
agreements O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
japan B-GPE
is O
not O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
content O
of O
the O
agreements O
, O
ah O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
content O
, O
because O
it O
seems O
that O
neither O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
issues O
that O
japan B-GPE
wanted O
greatly O
to O
talk O
about O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
and O
the O
oil O
pipeline O
issue O
, O
made O
the O
achievements O
they O
had O
anticipated O
. O

well O
, O
was O
this O
within O
the O
expectations O
of O
you O
two B-CARDINAL
experts O
? O

right O
, O
this O
is O
rather O
consistent O
with O
unanimous O
international O
public O
opinion O
analysis O
as O
well O
as O
our O
opinion O
these O
days O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
this O
, O
this O
, O
this O
discussion O
, O
it O
was O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
leaders O
of O
both O
sides O
, O
which O
by O
itself O
is O
an O
achievement O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

as O
we O
know O
, O
putin B-GPE
has O
kept O
putting O
off O
this O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
since O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
like O
back O
then O
when O
yeltsin B-PERSON
repeatedly O
postponed O
his O
trip O
to O
japan B-GPE
. O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
japan B-GPE
asked O
for O
too O
high O
a O
price O
. O

that O
is O
, O
it O
asked O
the O
russian B-NORP
president O
to O
come O
to O
japan B-GPE
to O
make O
concessions O
on O
territorial O
issues O
. O

well O
, O
%pw O
, O
well O
, O
the O
russian B-NORP
president O
was O
still O
unwilling O
, O
was O
unwilling O
to O
make O
concessions O
. O

therefore O
, O
the O
itinerary O
was O
not O
decided O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

well O
, O
russia B-GPE
's O
attitude O
was O
that O
it O
would O
not O
talk O
about O
territorial O
issues O
if O
it O
went O
. O

well O
, O
this O
japan O
, O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
japan B-GPE
, O
without O
discussion O
of O
territorial O
issues O
, O
the O
talks O
were O
viewed O
as O
making O
no O
progress O
. O

for O
japanese B-NORP
citizens O
, O
this O
was O
meaningless O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

it O
only O
provided O
koizumi B-PERSON
with O
a O
diplomatic O
stage O
. O

what O
method O
does O
he O
want O
to O
use O
to O
remedy O
the O
lethargic O
post-apec B-ORG
diplomatic O
situation O
? O

well O
, O
what O
russia B-GPE
actually O
wants O
is O
economic O
cooperation O
with O
japan B-GPE
, O

uh-huh O
. O

including O
the O
development O
of O
oil O
resources O
in O
eastern O
siberia B-LOC
, O
and O
, O
um O
, O
some O
other O
investment O
and O
trade O
. O

well O
, O
japan B-GPE
is O
still O
like O
this O
, O
saying O
first B-ORDINAL
return O
the O
territories O
, O
then O
we O
can O
talk O
about O
economics O
. O

well O
, O
this O
time O
, O
based O
on O
the O
outcome O
this O
time O
, O
i O
think O
this O
basic O
structure O
remains O
unchanged O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

er O
, O
director O
xing B-PERSON
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
this O
time O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
very O
important O
purposes O
of O
president O
putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
is O
to O
facilitate O
the O
progress O
of O
bilateral O
relations O
through O
economic O
development O
. O

but O
from O
what O
our O
professor O
wang B-PERSON
has O
just O
introduced O
, O
do O
you O
think O
putin B-PERSON
has O
achieved O
his O
aim O
? O

eh O
, O
he O
should O
be O
said O
to O
have O
achieved O
his O
aim O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

the O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
was O
in O
itself O
one O
of O
putin B-PERSON
's O
important O
aims O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

because O
with O
large O
preconditions O
having O
been O
set O
, O
and O
now O
the O
framework O
having O
being O
set O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
for O
putin B-PERSON
to O
have O
further O
substantive O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
to O
make O
major O
breakthroughs O
on O
the O
substantive O
issues O
of O
russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
japanese I-NORP
relations O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
as O
two B-CARDINAL
neighboring O
nations O
, O
ah O
, O
relations O
between O
them O
should O
be O
developed O
, O
development O
of O
relations O
should O
be O
further O
promoted O
. O

there O
should O
be O
exchanges O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
which O
would O
not O
work O
if O
putin B-PERSON
refuses O
to O
go O
, O
refuses O
to O
come O
. O

so O
, O
well O
, O
how O
did O
he O
come O
, O
how O
did O
he O
come O
to O
japan B-GPE
? O

as O
mentioned O
earlier O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
had O
been O
postponed O
again O
and O
again O
, O
but O
by O
way O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
opportunity O
, O
well O
, O
putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
was O
smoothly O
accomplished O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

as O
to O
what O
kind O
of O
result O
you O
want O
, O
that O
is O
another O
matter O
. O

right O
. O

but O
making O
the O
trip O
was O
significant O
in O
itself O
. O

what O
was O
the O
significance O
? O

it O
was O
that O
russia B-GPE
sent O
a O
very O
important O
message O
, O
that O
is O
, O
russia B-GPE
is O
willing O
to O
develop O
relations O
with O
japan B-GPE
. O

we O
sincerely O
have O
such O
a O
wish O
. O

a O
wish O
is O
the O
start O
of O
achieving O
results O
. O

we O
have O
such O
a O
start O
. O

both O
leaders O
saved O
a O
bit O
of O
face O
. O

right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
giving O
face O
to O
each O
other O
. O
also O
, O
on O
the O
surface O
we O
saw O
it O
looked O
fine O
, O
with O
12 O
, O
12 B-CARDINAL
documents O
signed O
as O
just O
mentioned O
. O

they O
both O
gave O
face O
. O

right O
. O

it O
is O
another O
matter O
if O
you O
care O
about O
the O
size O
of O
the O
documents O
. O

but O
they O
were O
signed O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
can O
we O
interpret O
it O
this O
way O
? O

based O
on O
the O
briefing O
given O
by O
you O
two B-CARDINAL
experts O
, O
both O
japanese B-NORP
prime O
minister O
junichiro B-PERSON
koizumi I-PERSON
and O
russian B-NORP
president O
putin B-PERSON
, O
they O
both O
achieved O
their O
own O
aims O
in O
form O
and O
got O
or O
, O
er O
, O
obtained O
what O
they O
wanted O
through O
this O
visit O
. O

on O
this O
point O
, O
their O
two B-CARDINAL
fates O
are O
connected O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
both O
sides O
have O
strong O
nationalist O
sentiments O
domestically O
and O
powerful O
parliaments O
. O

well O
, O
i O
think O
at O
this O
point O
it O
would O
be O
ludicrous O
for O
putin B-PERSON
to O
concede O
on O
the O
territorial O
issues O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
as O
you O
should O
know O
, O
it O
is O
entirely O
impossible O
, O
impossible O
behavior O
. O

right O
. O

well O
, O
it O
seems O
it O
may O
also O
be O
very O
difficult O
for O
koizumi B-PERSON
now O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
on O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
to O
return O
to O
what O
is O
called O
, O
er O
, O
economics O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
territories O
second B-ORDINAL

or O
the O
separation O

to O
jointly O
develop O
the O
four O
, O
four O
islands O
, O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
. O

well O
, O
in O
fact O
the O
theory O
of O
joint O
development O
was O
originally O
proposed O
by O
russia B-GPE
. O

well O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
in O
1996 B-DATE
, O
primakov B-PERSON
also O
proposed O
it O
when O
he O
was O
foreign O
minister O
. O

it O
had O
been O
raised O
prior O
to O
that O
too O
, O
but O
japan B-GPE
did O
not O
accept O
it O
at O
that O
time O
. O

well O
, O
why O
did O
taro B-PERSON
aso I-PERSON
recently O
again O
propose O
such O
a O
, O
er O
, O
such O
a O
suggestion O
? O

well O
, O
i O
checked O
some O
data O
, O
ah O
. O

japan B-GPE
's O
recent O
reaction O
is O
not O
japan B-GPE
's O
mainstream O
domestic O
opinion O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
domestic O
political O
circles O
in O
japan B-GPE
all O
opposed O
this O
suggestion O
by O
taro B-PERSON
aso I-PERSON
. O

uh-huh O
. O

they O
said O
that O
with O
joint O
development O
, O
russia B-GPE
would O
advocate O
adopting O
the O
current O
russian B-NORP
controlled O
situation O
, O
the O
current O
situation O
, O
and O
applying O
russian B-NORP
law O
. O

well O
, O
by O
making O
investments O
there O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
well O
, O
it O
would O
be O
equivalent O
to O
permanent O
recognition O
that O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
are O
russia B-GPE
's O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
this O
theory O
of O
joint O
development O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
make O
progress O
either O
. O

so O
under O
the O
current O
situation O
, O
the O
meeting O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
leaders O
itself O
was O
the O
greatest O
achievement O
this O
time O
. O

the O
rest O
did O
not O
have O
any O
substantive O
significance O
. O

right O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

i O
'd O
like O
to O
add O
a O
few O
words O

regarding O
the O
joint O
development O
he O
talked O
about O
, O
russia B-GPE
is O
also O
very O
interesting B-GPE
. O

now O
russia O
, O
the O
japanese B-NORP
proposed O
it O
, O
now O
russia B-GPE
instead O
rejected O
it O
. O

it O
rejected O
it O
, O
its O
government O
stated O
very O
clearly O
, O
we O
can O
not O
jointly O
develop O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O

this O
is O
a O

under O

from O

koizumi B-PERSON
reluctantly O
attended O
this O

furthermore O
, O
precisely O
because O
of O
this O
, O
putin B-PERSON

visit O

was O
basically O
confirmed O
. O

this O
time O
, O
on O
this O
visit O
between O
japan O
and O
the O
us O
, O
er O
, O
between O
russia B-GPE
and O
japan B-GPE
, O
ah O
, O
er O
, O
as O
far O
as O
japan B-GPE
was O
concerned O
, O
it O
really O
hoped O
that O
russian B-NORP
president O
putin B-PERSON
would O
talk O
about O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
during O
his O
visit O
. O

however O
, O
russia B-GPE
's O
thinking O
was O
, O
er O
, O
we O
want O
to O
develop O
the O
economy O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

there O
should O
be O
economic O
cooperation O
before O
we O
can O
talk O
about O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
, O
which O
means O
that O
currently O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
both O
insist O
on O
a O
condition O
from O
the O
other O
side O
. O

well O
, O
in O
this O
way O
, O
the O
conflict O
would O
become O
more O
conspicuous O
during O
the O
talks O
. O

well O
, O
was O
this O
also O
the O
reason O
that O
caused O
russian B-NORP
president O
putin B-PERSON
, O
in O
spite O
of O
" O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
being O
close O
neighbors O
" O
these B-DATE
five I-DATE

, O
to O
visit O
japan B-GPE
again O
only O
after O
these O
five O
years O
, O
an O
interval O
of O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
? O

this O
is O
already O
, O
this O
is O
not O
just O
during O
putin B-PERSON
's O
tenure O
, O
that O
is O
, O
it O
has O
been O
like O
this O
for O
the B-DATE
60 I-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
the O
war O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
, O
whether O
there O
should O
be O
a O
separation O
of O
politics O
and O
economics O
or O
not O
. O

that O
is O
, O
whether O
it O
should O
be O
economic O
cooperation O
first B-ORDINAL
or O
resolution O
of O
political O
issues O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
this O
eased O
for O
a O
period O
after O
the B-EVENT
cold I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
during O
the O
gorbachev B-PERSON
era O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
, O
gorbachev B-PERSON
recognized O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
issue O
between O
japan B-GPE
and O
russia B-GPE
. O

there O
was O
nothing O
like O
this O
in O
the O
past O
. O

in O
the O
past O
, O
only O
the O
issue O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
was O
recognized O
. O

well O
, O
there O
was O
once O
an O
opportunity O
for O
this O
, O
but O
japan B-GPE
again O
did O
not O
seize O
it O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

russia B-GPE
has O
changed O
a O
lot O
as O
well O
. O

well O
, O
later O
, O
that O
is O
, O
after O
several O
changes O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
during O
hashimoto B-PERSON
ryutaro I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
term O
, O
ah O
, O
russia B-PERSON
proposed O
separating O
politics O
from O
economics O
, O
to O
make O
progress O
on O
both O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

however O
, O
when O
it O
came O
to O
the O
critical O
moment O
, O
that O
is O
, O
on O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
perhaps O
due O
to O
japan B-GPE
's O
domestic O
nationalist O
sentiments O
and O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
any O
prime O
minister O
to O
claim O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
only O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

when O
talks O
on O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
came O
to O
a O
final O
decision O
, O
the O
japanese B-NORP
prime O
minister O
retreated O
again O
to O
the O
point O
that O
politics O
and O
economics O
could O
not O
be O
separated O
and O
that O
political O
issues O
should O
still O
be O
resolved O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
the O
russian B-NORP
president O
was O
exactly O
the O
opposite O
, O
that O
is O
, O
denying O
at O
critical O
moments O
that O
there O
were O
territorial O
issues O
, O
that O
is O
, O
sometimes O
even O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
give O
the O
territories O
to O
japan B-GPE
. O

so O
, O
this O
shows O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
resolve O
japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
russian I-NORP
relations O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

i O
think O
in O
the O
near O
future O
, O
er O
, O
the O
possibility O
of O
breakthrough O
progress O
is O
also O
very O
little O
, O
very O
small O
. O

eh O
, O
we O
all O
know O
japan B-GPE
is O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
largest O
economy O
in O
the O
world O
. O

furthermore O
, O
japan B-GPE
is O
also O
a O
very O
important O
investor O
overseas O
. O

however O
, O
a O
set O
of O
data O
shows O
that O
japanese B-NORP
investment O
in O
russia B-GPE
accounts O
for O
only O
1 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
its O
investments O
overseas O
, O
that O
is O
, O
just O
over O
700 B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
us I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

well O
, O
as O
russia B-GPE
should O
be O
said O
to O
badly O
need O
japanese B-NORP
funds O
, O
as O
well O
as O
badly O
needing O
japanese B-NORP
economic O
cooperation O
, O
well O
, O
how O
urgent O
do O
you O
think O
russia B-GPE
's O
need O
is O
? O

i O
think O
the O
time O
of O
russia B-GPE
's O
most O
urgent O
need O
is O
already O
over O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

the O
most O
urgent O
time O
was O
still O
the B-DATE
1990s I-DATE
. O

at O
that O
time O
, O
russia B-GPE
was O
indeed O
pressing O
for O
japanese B-NORP
investment O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

because O
russia B-GPE
was O
in O
a O
high O
degree O
, O
or O
deep O
degree O
of O
overall O
crisis O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

it O
was O
like O
a O
very O
thirsty O
man O
who O
needs O
to O
drink O
water O
. O

at O
such O
time O
, O
he O
needs O
, O
needs O
someone O
else O
to O
give O
him O
a O
cup O
of O
water O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
now O
, O
the O
economic O
crisis O
in O
russia B-GPE
is O
essentially O
over O
. O

well O
, O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
russia B-GPE
, O
er O
, O
it O
can O
make O
diplomatic O
arrangements O
calmly O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

therefore O
, O
i O
think O
japan B-GPE
, O
that O
is O
, O
again O
lost O
the O
best O
opportunity O
to O
enter O
the O
%pw O
russian B-NORP
market O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

it O
can O
not O
be O
said O
to O
have O
lost O
it O
forever O
. O

in O
other O
words O
, O
that O
time O
was O
the O
best O
, O
a O
relatively O
good O
period O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

why O
should O
we O
say O
that O
? O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
at O
that O
time O
if O
japan B-GPE
had O
made O
a O
very O
good O
investment O
in O
russia B-GPE
, O
well O
, O
japan B-GPE
, O
in O
terms O
of O
russia B-GPE
's O
economy O
, O
it O
could O
have O
helped O
russia B-GPE
's O
economic O
recovery O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
currently O
japan B-GPE
is O
very O
important O
to O
russia B-GPE
again O
. O

well O
, O
as O
a O
neighboring O
nation O
, O
especially O
as O
japan B-GPE
is O
a O
world O
economic O
power O
, O
russia B-GPE
really O
needs O
japanese B-NORP
investment O
, O
now O
not O
japanese B-NORP
aid O
, O
but O
its O
investment O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

it O
can O
also O
be O
said O
it O
is O
this O
way O
strategically O
. O

putin B-PERSON
's O
current O
strategy O
is O
to O
build O
a O
powerful O
nation O
, O
a O
strategy O
for O
making O
his O
country O
powerful O
and O
his O
people O
rich O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
this O
strategy O
is O
extremely O
clear O
. O

he O
used O
an O
expression O
, O
saying O
that O
russia B-GPE
's O
diplomacy O
is O
economic O
diplomacy O
. O

all O
economic O
%pw O
, O
diplomatic O
activities O
must O
promote O
russia B-GPE

prosperity O
, O
eh O
, O
development O
, O
and O
wealth O
and O
power O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
seen O
from O
this O
perspective O
, O
well O
, O
%pw O
japan B-GPE
is O
very O
important O
to O
russia B-GPE
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

therefore O
, O
just O
now O
you O
mentioned O
some O
figures O
regarding O
russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
japanese I-NORP
relations O
, O
that O
is O
, O
economic O
and O

for O

as O
japan B-GPE
, O
well O
, O
it O
invested O
only O
700-plus B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
in O

this O

extremely O

billion I-MONEY
. O

well O
, O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
's I-DATE
trade O
volume O
was O
perhaps O
more B-MONEY
than I-MONEY
9 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
. O

this O
year O
, O
%pw O
, O
koizumi B-PERSON
said O
it O
may O
exceed O
100 B-MONEY
trillion I-MONEY
. O

this O
is O
a O
very O
small O
figure O
in O
terms O
of O
trade O
relations O
between O
two B-CARDINAL
countries O
. O

it O
has O
nearly O
reached O
200 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
between O
china B-GPE
and O
japan B-GPE
. O

so O
. O

right O
. O

here O
it O
has O
a O
comparison O
. O

er O
, O
between O
russia B-GPE
and O
japan B-GPE
, O
the O
trade O
volume O
only O
equals O
, O
of O
sino B-NORP
- I-NORP
japanese I-NORP
trade O
volume O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
twenty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
second I-CARDINAL
. O

uh-huh O
. O

right O
. O

it O
seems O
to O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
twenty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
second I-CARDINAL
, O
or O
one B-CARDINAL
nineteenth I-CARDINAL
. O

well O
, O
what O
does O
this O
status O
show O
? O

right O
, O
just O
about O
, O
eh O
. O

it O
shows O
-- O
i O
will O
explain O
two B-CARDINAL
issues O
-- O
one B-CARDINAL
, O
it O
may O
show O
that O
the O
economic O
environment O
in O
russia B-GPE
is O
indeed O
not O
very O
good O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

in O
general O
, O
none O
of O
the O
various O
countries O
, O
eh O
, O
large O
nations O
in O
the O
world O
, O
have O
entered O
the O
russian B-NORP
market O
with O
much O
ease O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

this O
is O
an O
objective O
factor O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
subjective O
factor O
too O
. O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
it O
is O
not O
that O
japan B-GPE
does O
not O
need O
the O
russian B-NORP
market O
. O

perhaps O
some O
non-economic O
factor O
is O
playing O
a O
role O
. O

it O
has O
always O
been O
the O
territorial O
issue O
. O

well O
, O
as O
we O
said O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
nationalist O
sentiment O
plays O
a O
great O
role O
here O
. O

so O
one O
very O
important O
aim O
of O
putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
this O
time O
, O
which O
i O
also O
think O
is O
very O
clever O
, O
is O
to O
put O
aside O
some O
very O
sensitive O
old O
territorial O
topics O
. O

this O
topic O
is O
hard O
to O
tackle O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

however O
, O
he O
can O
promote O
the O
development O
of O
economic O
relations O
, O
as O
economics O
is O
a O
dynamic O
factor O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

putin B-PERSON
came O
this O
time O
bringing O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
100 I-CARDINAL
people O
, O
such O
a O
large O
delegation O
, O
to O
japan B-GPE
. O

he O
still O
intends O
to O
solicit O
businesses O
and O
investment O
, O
to O
use O
our O
chinese B-NORP
expression O
, O
yet O
this O
intention O
is O
very O
obvious O
. O

right O
, O
right O
. O

right O
, O
i O
think O
. O

however O
, O
based O
on O
this O
outcome O
, O
the O
form O
still O
seems O
to O
have O
outdone O
the O
content O
. O

i O
think O
that O
with O
regard O
to O
japan B-GPE
's O
relations O
with O
russia B-GPE
, O
it O
has O
been O
like O
this O
since O
the B-DATE
1970s I-DATE
. O

when O
tanaka B-PERSON
kakuei I-PERSON
went O
there O
, O
he O
also O
did O
this O
. O

i O
will O
invest O
, O
i O
will O
give O
you O
aid O
to O
develop O
eastern O
siberia B-LOC
. O

that O
's O
because O
russia B-GPE
has O
a O
vast O
area O
of O
land O
. O

we O
know O
the O
population O
is O
small O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
they O
can O
not O
develop O
it O
. O

that O
is O
, O
the O
treasure O
is O
all O
hidden O
underground O
. O

well O
, O
at O
that O
time O
it O
, O
it O
still O
, O
they O
still O
wanted O
to O
solve O
the O
population O
problem O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
this O
, O
that O
is O
, O
japan B-GPE
used O
economics O
for O
political O
purposes O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
now O
it O
seems O
that O
koizumi B-PERSON
has O
still O
not O
changed O
this O
course O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
this O
way O
, O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
dead O
knot O
can O
be O
untied O
. O

also O
, O
if O
things O
continue O
like O
this O
, O
increasing O
the O
nations O
' O
mutual O
trust O
can O
never O
be O
realized O
. O

yes O
, O
this O
is O
, O
eh O
, O
just O
now O
director O
xing B-PERSON
mentioned O
a O
very O
important O
issue O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
nationalist O
sentiment O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
regarding O
putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
this O
time O
, O
the O
media O
earlier O
predicted O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
that O
when O
the O
time O
came O
, O
there O
would O
be O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
%pw I-CARDINAL
60 I-CARDINAL
groups O
totaling O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
700 I-CARDINAL
people O
, O
along O
with O
more O
than O
200 O
propaganda O
trucks O
, O
hey O
, O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
200 I-CARDINAL
propaganda O
trucks O
on O
the O
streets O
of O
downtown O
tokyo B-GPE
, O
to O
protest O
against O
putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
. O

well O
, O
what O
forces O
do O
these O
people O
and O
groups O
holding O
street O
protests O
represent O
? O

what O
are O
they O
asking O
for O
? O

and O
what O
impact O
will O
it O
have O
on O
putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
? O

okay O
. O

they O
are O
some O
focused O
right O
- O
wing O
groups O
, O
similar O
to O
a O
gang O
society O
. O

but O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
this O
russian B-NORP
issue O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
can O
not O
be O
simply O
regarded O
as O
a O
handful O
of O
people O
making O
trouble O
, O
because O
there O
are O
widespread O
historical O
grievances O
among O
ordinary O
people O
in O
japan B-GPE
against O
russia B-GPE
. O

i O
have O
had O
contact O
with O
many O
japanese B-NORP
. O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
this O
involves O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
northern B-LOC
territories I-LOC
issue O
. O

well O
, O
i O
think O
it O
originated O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
and O
involves O
three B-CARDINAL
major O
issues O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
is O
that O
historically O
and O
legally O
, O
it O
has O
changed O
several O
times O
. O

for O
instance O
, O
in O
1855 B-DATE
, O
in O
1875 B-DATE
, O
and O
in O
1905 B-DATE
after O
the B-EVENT
russo I-EVENT
- I-EVENT
japanese I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
, O
and O
also O
ww B-EVENT
ii I-EVENT
, O
at O
these O
critical O
points O
, O
ownership O
of O
the O
territories O
was O
constantly O
changing O
. O

with O
ancestors O
constantly O
changing O
, O
both O
sides O
had O
their O
own O
arguments O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
ownership O
of O
the B-LOC
northern I-LOC
territories I-LOC
has O
changed O
several O
times O
, O
and O
there O
has O
been O
no O
single O
law O
. O

therefore O
, O
there O
is O
truth O
on O
both O
sides O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

now O
russia B-GPE
says O
this O
was O
the O
result O
of O
wwii B-EVENT
international O
laws O
and O
treaties O
, O
with O
the O
us B-GPE
also O
recognizing O
it O
at O
that O
time O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

the O
entire O
international O
community O
recognizes O
that O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
should O
belong O
to O
russia B-GPE
. O

both O
the B-LAW
yalta I-LAW
agreement I-LAW
and O
article B-LAW
2 I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
san I-LAW
francisco I-LAW
treaty I-LAW
recognize O
japan B-GPE
's O
relinquishment O
of O
the B-LOC
kuril I-LOC
islands I-LOC
. O

however O
, O
then O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
nationalist O
sentiment O
, O
that O
is O
, O
japan B-GPE
believes O
that O
the B-GPE
soviet I-GPE
union I-GPE
unilaterally O
broke O
the B-LAW
pact I-LAW
of I-LAW
neutrality I-LAW
, O
sending O
troops O
into O
northeast B-LOC
china I-LOC
and O
defeating O
the B-ORG
kwantung I-ORG
army I-ORG
. O

for O
things O
like O
this O
, O
as O
japan B-GPE
looks O
at O
this O
piece O
of O
history O
-- O
also O
, O
japanese B-NORP
captives O
were O
dragged O
to O
siberia B-LOC
to O
labor O
camps O
-- O
i O
heard O
there O
were O
100,000 B-CARDINAL
, O
200,000 B-CARDINAL
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
there O
is O
also O
a O
nationalist O
sentiment O
issue O
; O
also O
, O
including O
this O
, O
these O
have O
all O
been O
brought O
together O
. O

therefore O
, O
unraveling O
this O
historical O
feud O
, O
the O
northern B-LOC
territories I-LOC
issue O
, O
is O
not O
so O
clear O
- O
cut O
, O
since O
history O
, O
society O
, O
and O
law O
, O
as O
well O
as O
nationalist O
sentiments O
are O
all O
entangled O
together O
. O

yeah O
. O

just O
now O
you O
mentioned O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

well O
, O
today B-DATE
we O
have O
been O
talking O
about O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
. O

well O
, O
how O
exactly O
did O
the O
four B-CARDINAL

with O
highly O

the O
ownership O

these O

has O
long O
been O
a O
dead O
knot O
in O
russian B-NORP

japanese I-NORP

that O
has O
been O
difficult O

in O

japan B-GPE
again O
said O

the O

proposal O
could O
definitely O

for O

, O
japanese B-NORP

due O
to O
the O

today B-DATE
, O
already O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
50 I-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
the O

the O

in O

literal O
sense O
, O
if O
the O
two B-CARDINAL

have O
not O

, O
it O
means O
at O
this O
point O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
nations O
are O
still O
at O
war O
. O

as O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
experts O
are O
constantly O
discussing O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
is O
a O
dead O
knot O
in O
japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
russian I-NORP
relations O
, O
yet O
this O
dead O
knot O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
currently O
both O
sides O
have O
this O
idea O
, O
they O
want O
to O
untie O
this O
dead O
knot O
. O

well O
, O
we O
noticed O
, O
er O
, O
just O
now O
this O
short O
clip O
also O
talked O
about O
it O
, O
at O
that O
time O
the B-GPE
soviet I-GPE
union I-GPE
agreed O
to O
return O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
but O
, O
but O
, O
eh O
, O
japan B-GPE
never O
agreed O
. O

but O
now O
, O
we O
also O
notice O
that O
the O
japanese O
side O
again O
proposed O
, O
taro B-PERSON
aso I-PERSON
proposed O
a O
new O
idea O
, O
the O
joint O
development O
that O
the B-GPE
soviet I-GPE
union I-GPE
had O
previously O
talked O
about O
. O

well O
, O
can O
this O
point O
lead O
to O
a O
breakthrough O
in O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
nations O
' O
resolution O
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
? O

i O
think O
it O
is O
very O
hard O
, O
as O
joint O
development O
and O
sovereignty O
of O
the O
islands O
are O
, O
ah O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
concepts O
. O

it O
wo O
n't O
work O
, O
either O
, O
eh O
, O
eh O
. O

but O
this O
is O
relevant O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

oh O
, O
as O
i O
just O
mentioned O
, O
it O
was O
against O
a O
large O
background O
that O
russia B-GPE
first B-ORDINAL
proposed O
it O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

with O
quite O
a O
troubled O
economy O
, O
quite O
a O
troubled O
economy O
, O
russia B-GPE
needed O
japanese B-NORP
investment O
, O
needed O
japan B-GPE
to O
get O
involved O
through O
this O
channel O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
now O
that O
its O
economy O
has O
greatly O
improved O
, O
russia B-GPE
does O
not O
need O
to O
take O
this O
diplomatic O
risk O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

this O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
. O

second B-ORDINAL
, O
russia B-GPE
should O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
rather O
strong O
nation O
. O

well O
, O
this O
place O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
, O
is O
a O
very O
sensitive O
region O
for O
the O
russian B-NORP
psyche O
. O

any O
small O
, O
small O
diplomatic O
or O
economic O
action O
will O
affect O
the O
psyche O
of O
russian B-NORP
citizens O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
, O
well O
, O
putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
this O
time O
, O
or O
during O
his O
visit O
to O
japan B-GPE
, O
or O
prior O
to O
this O
, O
there O
were O
rallies O
in O
the O
far B-LOC
east I-LOC
region O
, O
including O
the O
sakhalin B-LOC
area O
, O
meant O
to O
give O
many O
warnings O
to O
putin B-PERSON
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
russian B-NORP
politicians O
also O
made O
many O
appeals O
regarding O
this O
. O

well O
, O
one O
russian B-NORP
politician O
stated O
very O
clearly O
that O
while O
russia B-GPE
's O
territory O
is O
vast O
, O
russia B-GPE
does O
not O
have O
territories O
to O
spare O
. O

this O
is O
a O
very O
, O
very O
, O
eh O
, O
tough O
kind O
of O
issue O
. O

well O
, O
as O
i O
just O
said O
very O
clearly O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
legal O
and O
historical O
complications O
, O
the O
repeated O
change O
of O
ownership O
, O
and O
then O
national O
sentiments O
as O
well O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
are O
also O
strategically O
very O
important O
. O

that O
is O
, O
does O
n't O
russia B-GPE
advocate O
a O
double O
- O
headed O
eagle O
policy O
? O

right O
, O
right O
. O

it O
is O
both O
a O
european B-NORP
and O
asian B-NORP
nation O
. O

well O
, O
if O
he O
wants O
development O
in O
asia B-LOC
, O
wo O
n't O
he O
close O
the O
door O
if O
he O
loses O
hold O
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
now O
? O

uh-huh O
. O

fisheries O
. O

the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
not O
only O
have O
mineral O
deposits O
, O
oil O
, O
and O
fisheries O
, O
but O
also O
for O
military O
strategy O
, O
they O
are O
key O
positions O
in O
the B-LOC
pacific I-LOC
ocean I-LOC
. O

in O
the B-LOC
pacific I-LOC
ocean I-LOC
, O
right O
. O

currently O
russia B-GPE
seems O
to O
be O
in O
a O
period O
of O
low O
tide O
, O
but O
it O
wo O
n't O
stay O
this O
way O
forever O
. O

right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
. O

it O
is O
still O
a O
large O
nation O
. O

it O
is O
still O
a O
large O
nation O
. O

it O
is O
also O
an O
international O
power O
. O

therefore O
, O
none O
of O
its O
leaders O
can O
easily O
give O
away O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

it O
, O
if O
it O
, O
let O
me O
again O
add O
some O
words O
, O
if O
it O
wants O
joint O
development O
, O
japanese B-NORP
companies O
and O
japanese B-NORP
influence O
will O
enter O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

right O
, O
right O
. O

well O
, O
after O
entering O
, O
economy O
, O
economic O
influence O
may O
lead O
to O
political O
influence O
. O

currently O
that O
would O
seem O
to O
benefit O
japan O
. O

yes O
. O

it O
would O
benefit O
japan B-GPE
. O

russia B-GPE
has O
foreseen O
the O
consequences O
. O

that O
's O
why O
russia B-GPE
now O
rejects O
it O
. O

it O
was O
originally O
proposed O
by O
russia B-GPE
, O
but O
rejected O
by O
japan B-GPE
. O

uh-huh O
. O

this O
is O
a O
new O
incarnation O
, O
but O
with O
different O
political O
significance O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

well O
, O
since O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
is O
a O
dead O
knot O
in O
bilateral O
relations O
that O
can O
not O
be O
untied O
, O
and O
also O
both O
are O
working O
hard O
, O
yet O
with O
seemingly O
little O
hope O
in O
sight O
, O
well O
, O
how O
can O
japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
russian I-NORP
relations O
develop O
under O
such O
circumstances O
? O

i O
think O
both O
sides O
generally O
know O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
' O
levels O
of O
political O
operations O
, O
knowing O
that O
territorial O
issues O
are O
hard O
to O
resolve O
. O

so O
, O
with O
this O
issue O
having O
gone O
on O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
both O
sides O
may O
have O
a O
bottom O
line O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
say O
we O
will O
stay O
opposed O
to O
each O
other O
as O
long O
as O
it O
is O
unresolved O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
it O
may O
be O
like O
this O
. O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
in O
the O
future O
both O
sides O
may O
become O
more O
reasonable O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

that O
is O
, O
looking O
farther O
ahead O
, O
normalization O
of O
relations O
will O
still O
be O
gradually O
developed O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
, O
do O
n't O
always O
get O
stuck O
on O
the O
territorial O
issue O
. O

but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
territorial O
issue O
is O
also O
quite O
important O
and O
sensitive O
. O

so O
it O
is O
unrealistic O
for O
you O
to O
say O
there O
will O
be O
breakthrough O
progress O
in O
japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
russian I-NORP
relations O
and O
that O
their O
economic O
and O
trade O
relations O
will O
suddenly O
achieve O
100 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
the O
prospects O
for O
japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
russian I-NORP
relations O
are O
not O
too O
good O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
, O
it O
will O
be O
a O
normal O
, O
that O
is O
, O
very O
common O
, O
very O
, O
relatively O
bland O
kind O
of O
relationship O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
, O
russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
japanese I-NORP
relations O
, O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
russia B-GPE
, O
i O
do O
n't O
see O
many O
changes O
in O
the O
large O
framework O
of O
russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
japanese I-NORP
relations O
. O

well O
, O
mr. O
xing B-PERSON
, O
how O
do O
you O
view O
russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
japanese I-NORP
relations O
? O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
these O
basic O
tones O
have O
been O
set O
. O

the O
main O
issue O
is O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

however O
, O
current O
signs O
show O
that O
russia B-GPE
and O
japan B-GPE
are O
moving O
forward O
on O
economic O
issues O
, O
on O
economic O
cooperation O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

yes O
. O

i O
will O
give O
two B-CARDINAL
examples O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
example O
is O
that O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
toyota B-ORG
motor I-ORG
has O
invested O
in O
st. B-GPE
petersburg I-GPE
. O

uh-huh O
. O

in O
addition O
, O
putin B-PERSON
attended O
the O
ribbon O
- O
cutting O
ceremony O
. O

this O
is O
quite O
, O
quite O
a O
clear O
signal O
. O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
russia O
-- O
japan B-GPE
has O
now O
invested O
in O
russia B-GPE
. O

second B-ORDINAL
, O
what O
japan B-GPE
hopes O
to O
get O
is O
, O
hey O
, O
russia B-GPE
's O
oil O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

though O
russia B-GPE
did O
not O
make O
a O
final O
commitment O
, O
there O
is O
already O
a O
general O
framework O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
eventually O
russia B-GPE
's O
oil O
pipeline O
will O
be O
connected O
to O
a O
pacific B-LOC
ocean I-LOC
port O
, O
which O
will O
benefit O
japan B-GPE
. O

uh-huh O
. O

that O
is O
, O
although O
there O
are O
obstacles O
in O
bilateral O
relations O
, O
they O
are O
still O
exploring O
forward O
movement O
. O

right O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

okay O
, O
well O
, O
today B-DATE
we O
will O

they O
've O
been O
here O
five O
years O
now O
, O
five O
years O
this O
summer O
because O
we O
were O
figuring O

. O
both O
oscar B-PERSON
and O
lehia B-PERSON
%um O
. O

he O

just O

eighteen B-DATE
now O

wow O
. O

he O
does O
n't O
live O

%um O
. O

he O
had O
kind O
of O
, O

well O
, O
so O
it O
's O
a O
long O
long O
story O

but O
%um O
at O
one O
point O
when O
i O
got O
real O
irritated O
with O
oscar B-PERSON
everybody O
in O
the O
family O
insisted O
that O
i O
was O
an O
idiot O
and O
i O
should O
make O
him O
take O
care O
of O
his O
children O
which O
you O
know O
i O
really O
believed O
when O
i O
was O
there O

and O
i O
and O
i- O
i O
mean O
it O
does O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
intellectual O
sense O
, O
i O
guess O
. O

but O
it O
really O

i O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
that O
to O
the O
kids O

but O
i O
did O

and O
so O
i O
sent O
them O
to O
stay O
with O
him O

and O
then O
i O
felt O
bad O
about O
it O
immediately O

and O
then O
he O
would O
n't O
let O
them O
come O
back O

and O
so O
it O
turned O
into O
a O
situation O
where O
lehia B-PERSON
was O
really O
the O
one O
that O
wanted O
to O
come O
back O
and O
oscar B-PERSON
junior O
kind O
of O
%um O
decided O
that O
living O
with O
his O
father O
was O
what O
he O
wanted O

mhm O

and O
lehia B-PERSON
's O
mom O
used O
to O
beg O
him O
to O
let O
her O
come O
back O

and O
he O
'd O
say O
yes O

and O
then O
he O
'd O
hang O
up O
the O
phone O

and O
he O
'd O
say O
i O
'd O
never O
let O
you O
go O
back O
there O
you O
know O
. O

i O
mean O
it O
was O
real O
stupid O
. O

it O
was O
n't O
really O
that O
he O
wanted O
her O
around O

but O
it O
was O
just O
it O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

people O
do O
stupid O
things O
. O

%hm O
. O

're O
living O
with O
him O
? O

probably O
two O

she O
and O
i O
worked O
it O
out O
where O
i O
got O
power O
of O

and O
she O
called O

one O
day O
when O
there O
was O
nobody O
in O

but O
her O

and O
i O
drove O
and O

her O
and O
kind O
of O
stole O
her O
back O

it O
was O
kind O
of O
exciting O

i O
could O
n't O
believe O
that O
i O
'd O
ever O
do O
that O

but O
oh O
well O
it O
was O
very O
exciting O
actually O
because O
oh O
my O
gosh O
i O
mean O
i O
had O
to O
drive O
like O
two B-TIME
and I-TIME
half I-TIME
hours I-TIME

so O
we O
you O
know O
you O
did O
n't O

at O
any O
moment O
somebody O
might O
be O
coming O
home O
. O

i O
said O
get O
your O
stuff O
ready O

and O
i O
called O
her O
when O
i O
got O
to O
the O
corner O
, O
you O

it O
was O
, O

. O

i O
mean O
there O
's O
was O
n't O
one O
inch O
of O
space O
left O

and O
then O
we O
just O
flew O
out O
of O
there O
, O

and O
we O
went O
to O
the O
nearest O
mcdonalds B-ORG
to O
kind O
of O
repack O
where O
we O
could O
breathe O
easy O

oh O
my O

almost O
committed O
suicide O
once O

but O
you O
know O
he O
does O
n't O
even O

any O
of O
it O
because O
it O
's O
not O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
care O
about O
his O
kids O
but O
he O
's O
not O
really O
capable O
of O
being O
a O
father O
. O

you O
know O

. O

they O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
burden O

sometime O
next B-DATE
week I-DATE

yeah O

but O
that O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
in O
a O
nutshell O
all O
the O
things O
that O
have O
been O
going O
on O

and O

wow O

i O

well O
it O
's O
interesting O
. O

. O

well O
i O

n't O

? O

let O
's O
see O
, O

well O
i O
came O
back O

i O
i O
taught O
adult O
basic O
education O
because O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
job O
in O
home O
ec O
which O
is O

it O
's O
probably O
still O
that O
way O

and O
i O
went O
for O
my O
masters O
in O
counseling O

and O
uh-huh O
%um O
actually O
i O
was O
asked O
to O
come O
back O
and O
be O
the O
counselor O
at O
the O
american B-NORP
school O

and O
that O
was O
the O
year O
i O
was O
pregnant O
with O
noel B-PERSON

and O
i O
was O
really O
torn O

i O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O

but O
my O
doctor O
did O
n't O
want O
me O
to O
go O
back O
to O
honduras B-GPE
because O
i O
'd O
been O
so O
sick O
before O
. O

he O
felt O
that O
y- O

mhm O
. O

i O
really O
needed O
. O

we O
did O
n't O
know O
how O
the O
pregnancy O
was O
going O
to O
go O

but O
i O
i O
feel O
like O

i O
really O
i O
mean O
i O
was O
n't O
really O
paying O
that O
much O
attention O
to O
what O
he O
said O

but O
that O
did O
influence O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

so O
i O
did O
n't O
go O

%hm O
. O

and O
%uh O
, O
let O
's O
see O
, O

what O
would O
i O
, O

i O
guess O
i O
was O
working O
part O
time O
that O
year O
doing O
part O
time O
counseling O
jobs O

and O
then O
that B-DATE

the O
other O
one O
was O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
a O
principal O
to O
come O
back O
%um O

mhm O
. O

but O
i O
ended O
up O
. O

i O
wanted O
to O
go O
into O
high O
school O
counseling O

but O
i O
could O
n't O
because O
the O
principal O
was O
out O
on O
this O
boat O
they O
told O
me O
and O
he O
c- O
had O
to O
make O
the O
decision O

it O
's O
like O
oh O
i O
need O
th- O
i O
need O
this O
need O

fast O
because O
i O
'm O
pregnant O
and O
i O
can O
not O
, O
you O
know O
, O
risk O
losing O
a O
job O
. O

so O
i O
ended O
up O
working O
at O
the O
sure O
. O
community O
college O
which O
was O
n't O
what O
i O
wanted O
at O
the O
time O

but O
a- O
as O
it O
's O
turned O
out O
it O
probably O
was O
the O
best O
%um O

and O
i O
like O
it O
real O
well O
. O

i O
l- O
i O
was O
cou- O
i O
counseled O
for O
about O
five O

i O
just O

think O
he O

going O

more O

going O
to O
hurt O
the O
country O
. O

i O
think O
the O

a O
-- O
is O
a O
bad O
one O

i O
think O
the O
wa- O
way O
he O

is O

is O
a O

david B-PERSON
you O
know O
the O
president O
does O
n't O
he O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
looking O
like O
the O
little O
rich O
kid O
who O
is O
not O
winning O
the O
game O
so O
he O
says O
it O
's O
my O
ball O
. O

i O
'm O
going O
home O
with O
it O
? O

well O
i O
have O
a O
theory O
about O
this O
chris B-PERSON
which O
is O
that O
every O
time O
somebody O
accuses O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
about O
being O
abrasive O
or O
abusive O
to O
subordinates O
or O
you O
know O
difficult O
to O
work O
with O
as O
somebody O
who O
is O
just O
going O
to O
break O
all O
the O
china O
in O
the O
place O
the O
president O
says O
oh O
yeah O
this O
is O
why O
i O
like O
the O
guy O
. O

this O
is O
exactly O
what O
i O
want O
at O
the B-ORG
united I-ORG
nations I-ORG
. O

and O
i O
'm O
-- O
i O
'm O
only O
half O
kidding O
. O

i O
really O
think O
that O
that O
is O
a O
big O
part O
of O
this O
that O
the O
president O
uh O
yes O
he O
may O
be O
ruffling O
feathers O
here O
but O
he O
does O
n't O
mind O
if O
he O
-- O
to O
deal O
with O
the B-ORG
united I-ORG
nations I-ORG
the O
president O
wants O
to O
do O
it O
in O
a O
pretty O
hardline O
way O
. O

but O
it O
uh O
but O
does O
n't O
-- O
well O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
this O
about O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
appointment O
because O
he O
can O
only O
be O
appointed O
through O
uh O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
next O
session O
of O
congress B-ORG
which O
is O
in O
early B-DATE
oh I-DATE
seven I-DATE
it O
's O
really O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

how O
can O
he O
really O
be O
a O
permanent O
representative O
and O
have O
the O
stature O
of O
one O
? O

well O
i O
think O
that O
's O
a O
big O
question O
. O

uh O
i O
me- O
it O
is O
a O
question O
that O
was O
posed O
to O
the O
un B-ORG
secretary O
- O
general O
today B-DATE
. O

i O
mean O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
the O
president O
has O
got O
some O
time O
to O
work O
with O
him O
. O

he O
has O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
up O
there O
. O

he O
knows O
he O
has O
got O
you O
know O
the O
president O
's O
authority O
. O

everybody O
up O
there O
in O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
understands O
that O
as O
well O
that O
he O
can O
push O
the O
the O
us B-GPE
agenda O
. O

and O
then O
we O
'll O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

i O
mean O
if O
he O
can O
prove O
to O
some O
democrats B-NORP
that O
uh O
he O
can O
work O
well O
with O
others O
up O
there O
perhaps O
he O
changes O
some O
minds O
. O

maybe O
that O
's O
-- O
uh O
that O
's O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

but O
the O
bottom O
line O
this O
is O
that O
this O
is O
not O
an O
administration O
that O
thinks O
very O
highly O
of O
the B-ORG
united I-ORG
nations I-ORG
. O

and O
the O
only O
real O
engagement O
we O
want O
to O
have O
at O
the O
un B-ORG
is O
to O
try O
to O
clean O
the O
place O
up O
. O

and O
so O
they O
're O
going O
to O
stand O
by O
the O
guy O
they O
think O
who O
can O
really O
do O
that O
. O

and O
this O
is O
very O
much O
a O
statement O
that O
the O
president O
was O
not O
going O
to O
be O
deterred O
from O
making O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
views O
of O
the O
un B-ORG
and O
how O
it O
ought O
to O
operate O
. O

how O
ra- O
how O
big O
a O
role O
has O
the O
vice O
president O
had O
in O
this O
appointment O
and O
this O
continuation O
to O
fight O
for O
him O
to O
the O
point O
of O
naming O
him O
a O
recess O
appointment O
? O

i O
think O
huge O
. O

and O
and O
in O
fact O
it O
's O
the O
vice O
president O
who O
's O
very O
close O
to O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
, O
who O
has O
been O
a O
real O
stalwart O
for O
him O
throughout O
this O
process O
. O

and O
i O
think O
it O
's O
perfectly O
clear O
that O
uh O
that O
he O
made O
the O
argument O
to O
the O
president O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
wobble O
on O
this O
one O
, O
that O
this O
is O
an O
important O
player O
in O
our O
agenda O
with O
the B-ORG
united I-ORG
nations I-ORG
. O

okay O

senator O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
about O
the O
democrats B-NORP
. O

the O
president O
referred O
to O
a O
handful O
of O
democrats B-NORP
. O

who O
is O
he O
talking O
about O
. O

who O
held O
up O
this O
nomination O
? O

well O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
there O
were O
fifty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
votes O
for O
cloture O
. O

so O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
united B-GPE
states I-GPE
senate B-ORG
supported O
ending O
the O
debate O
. O

i O
think O
bolton B-PERSON
would O
have O
gotten O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
votes O
to O
be O
confirmed O
. O

so O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
senate B-ORG
supported O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
. O

and O
in O
most O
democracies O
majorities O
actually O
get O
their O
way O
. O

senate B-ORG
procedure O
allows O
a O
minority O
to O
block O
this O
nomin- O
nomination O
. O

and O
they O
did O
. O

chris B-PERSON
two B-CARDINAL
other O
things O
. O

the O
bottom O
line O
is O
you O
're O
forgetting O
there O
's O
a O
conference O
on O
un B-ORG
reform O
major O
conference O
september B-DATE
fourteenth I-DATE
through I-DATE
the I-DATE
sixteenth I-DATE
. O

the O
president O
is O
going O
to O
be O
there O
make O
a O
major O
statement O
now O
he O
has O
got O
somebody O
who O
is O
there O
, O
who O
is O
his O
guy O
, O
who O
is O
going O
to O
work O
with O
him O
over O
these B-DATE
six I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

this O
is O
an O
important O
period O
of O
time O
. O

we O
've O
been O
six B-DATE
months I-DATE
without O
a O
permanent O
representative O
. O

the O
time O
was O
to O
do O
it O
now O
. O

and O
the O
president O
i O
believe O
did O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

let O
's O
listen O
to O
senator O
and O
former O
former O
majority O
leader O
trent B-PERSON
lott I-PERSON
of O
mississippi B-GPE
the O
united B-GPE
states I-GPE
senator O
from O
that O
state O
. O

here O
's O
what O
he O
said O
that O
he O
opposed O
the O
recess O
appointment O
of O
uh O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
. O

i O
have O
advised O
against O
it O
. O

uh O
i O
think O
that O
he O
was O
not O
confirmed O
. O

and O
if O
he O
went O
in O
there O
he O
would O
be O
limited O
to O
like B-DATE
seventeen I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

uh O
perhaps O
uh O
he O
would O
not O
be O
weakened O
. O

but O
uh O
you O
know O
it O
it O
appears O
to O
me O
that O
he O
would O
. O

uh O
but O
uh O
i O
i O
would O
recommend O
against O
a O
recess O
appointment O
. O

what O
do O
you O
make O
of O
that O
senator O
coleman B-PERSON
? O

i O
disagree O
with O
my O
my O
friend O
and O
respected O
colleague O
trent B-PERSON
lott I-PERSON
. O

bottom O
line O
is O
that O
this O
is O
an O
important O
moment O
. O

this O
un B-ORG
is O
is O
reeling O
from O
the O
aftermath O
of O
the O
investigation O
that O
we O
've O
done O
on O
oil O
for O
food O
. O

and O
they O
've O
been O
reeling O
from O
from O
the O
child O
prostitution O
in O
africa B-LOC
from O
the O
sexual O
harassment O
of O
top O
un B-ORG
personnel O
. O

they O
finally O
understand O
they O
have O
got O
to O
make O
change O
. O

uh O
hopefully O
get O
a B-PERSON
john I-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
who O
can O
force O
the O
chinese B-NORP
and O
zimbabwe B-GPE
and O
sudan B-GPE
to O
understand O
that O
we O
have O
got O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
odious O
human B-ORG
rights I-ORG
commission I-ORG
. O

and O
so O
the O
time O
is O
now O
. O

eh O
george B-PERSON
bush I-PERSON
is O
only O
going O
to O
be O
in O
office O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

that O
that O
that O
's O
how O
permanent O
permanent O
will O
be O
. O

uh O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
will O
be O
there O
during O
probably O
the O
most O
important O
time O
for O
the B-ORG
united I-ORG
nations I-ORG
in O
many B-DATE
many I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

do O
you O
think O
there O
's O
a O
value O
in O
itself O
in O
having O
someone O
to O
go O
up O
there O
and O
just O
waste O
the O
place O
i O
mean O
in O
other O
words O
just O
give O
tough O
speeches O
try O
to O
humiliate O
them O
uh O
try O
to O
get O
them O
out O
and O
get O
them O
straightened O
out O
by O
just O
making O
fun O
of O
them O
by O
basically O
trashing O
some O
of O
those O
third B-LOC
world I-LOC
members O
that O
have O
contributed O
to O
this O
uh O
horror O
in O
some O
of O
these O
cases O
you O
mentioned O
? O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
anyone O
-- O
uh O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
's O
-- O
there O
's O
any O
basis O
for O
saying O
that O
's O
what O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
do O
. O

john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
by O
the O
way O
was O
a O
very O
effective O
assistant O
of O
state O
. O

he O
helped O
the O
un B-ORG
get O
rid O
of O
its O
odious O
zionism B-NORP
is O
racism O
resolution O
in O
nineteen B-DATE
ninety I-DATE
- I-DATE
one I-DATE
when O
people O
said O
that O
could O
n't O
be O
done O
. O

so O
do O
n't O
underestimate O
the O
skill O
of O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
. O

is O
there O
a O
time O
to O
be O
tough O
? O

yeah O
. O

and O
he O
can O
be O
tough O
. O

is O
there O
a O
time O
to O
be O
persuasive O
? O

yeah O
. O

he O
can O
be O
persuasive O
. O

he O
's O
got O
a O
record O
of O
doing O
that O
. O

un B-ORG
officials O
themselves O
have O
said O
that O
. O

malloch B-PERSON
brown I-PERSON
has O
said O
that O
. O

kofi B-PERSON
annan I-PERSON
has O
said O
that O
. O

so O
i O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
simply O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
as O
a O
tough O
guy O
who O
is O
going O
to O
push O
folks O
around O
. O

but O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
things O
done O
. O

the O
moment O
for O
reform O
is O
now O
. O

and O
if O
we O
miss O
that O
moment O
shame O
on O
us O
. O

do O
you O
worry O
about O
him O
rattling O
the O
cage O
of O
uh O
the O
head O
of O
north B-GPE
korea I-GPE
with O
comments O
like O
he O
's O
a O
tyrannical O
dictator O
? O

you O
're O
dealing O
with O
a O
guy O
who O
is O
living O
on O
booze O
most O
of O
the O
time O
and O
delusions O
and O
movies O
and O
girlfriends O
provided O
for O
him O
. O

do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
safe O
to O
call O
him O
names O
? O

you O
're O
not O
talking O
about O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
now O
when O
you O
say O
that O
, O
right O
? O

no O
i O
'm O
talking O
about O
the O
head O
of O
north B-GPE
korea I-GPE
. O

do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
safe O
to O
to O
rattle O
the O
cage O
of O
a O
crazy O
man O
? O

uh O
chris B-PERSON
as O
you O
-- O
chris B-PERSON
as O
as O
as O
you O
well O
know O
- O

i O
should O
n't O
say O
crazy O
man O
. O

he O
might O
hear O
this O
. O

how O
about O
an O
unusual O
leader O
? O

eh O
everything O
that O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
said O
about O
kim B-PERSON
jong I-PERSON
was O
approved O
by O
the B-ORG
state I-ORG
department I-ORG
. O

there O
's O
not O
a O
record O
on O
it O
not O
a O
single O
thing O
in O
the O
record O
. O

i O
sat O
through O
all O
the O
*hearings O
hearings O
and O
read O
all O
the O
stuff O
. O

there O
's O
not O
a O
single O
thing O
that O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
said O
that O
was O
n't O
approved O
by O
higher O
powers O
. O

tyrannical O
dictator O
hellish O
nightmare O
on O
the B-DATE
eve I-DATE
of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
nation O
talks O
? O

that O
's O
what O
he O
is O
. O

oh O
yeah O
we O
know O
that O
. O

the O
truth O
hurts O
so O
much O
with O
this O
guy O
- O

so O
your O
listeners O
understand O
-- O
your O
listeners O
understand O
there O
's O
not O
a O
single O
thing O
that O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
said O
during O
that O
entire O
process O
that O
was O
not O
vetted O
, O
that O
was O
not O
cleared O
and O
that O
was O
not O
approved O
. O

so O
he O
is O
a O
tyrannical O
dictator O
for O
whatever O
reason O
folks O
said O
. O

that O
's O
the O
-- O
that O
's O
the O
approach O
we O
're O
going O
to O
use O
. O

and O
so O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
was O
n't O
off O
the O
reservation O
and O
was O
n't O
speaking O
out O
of O
school O
. O

he O
was O
speaking O
truth O
. O

and O
it O
was O
approved O
truth O
. O

what O
do O
you O
think O
about O
his O
comment O
that O
we O
we O
we O
could O
lose O
the O
top O
ten B-CARDINAL
floors O
of O
the O
un B-ORG
building O
and O
it O
would O
n't O
hurt O
? O

i O
hope O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
an O
office O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
top O
ten B-CARDINAL
floors O
. O

uh O
yeah O
you O
sound O
like O
barbara B-PERSON
boxer I-PERSON
now O
chris B-PERSON
. O

you O
know O
the O
reality O
he O
was O
saying O
that O
-- O
he O
was O
saying O
that O
-- O
he O
was O
saying O
that O
comment O
to O
a O
group O
-- O
he O
was O
saying O
that O
comment O
to O
a O
group O
of O
folks O
. O

it O
was O
-- O
it O
was O
a O
meeting O
in O
which O
they O
're O
talking O
about O
one B-CARDINAL
world O
government O
. O

he O
was O
saying O
hey O
folks O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

oh O
do O
n't O
. O

no O
no O
. O

now O
now O
we O
're O
at O
war O
. O

what O
did O
you O
just O
say O
? O

uh O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

and O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
folks O
would O
say O
the O
un B-ORG
has O
not O
been O
as O
effective O
as O
it O
should O
be O
. O

my O
investigation O
has O
*shown O
shown O
mismanagement O
at O
least O
perhaps O
corruption O
at O
worst O
. O

right O
. O

an- O
and O
so O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
folks O
saying O
you O
got O
to O
make O
change O
in O
the O
un B-ORG
. O

that O
's O
what O
that O
was O
all O
about O
. O

and O
the O
un B-ORG
recognized O
it O
now O
. O

that O
's O
why O
they O
're O
holding O
this O
meeting O
on O
reform O
. O

that O
's O
why O
the O
president O
is O
going O
to O
be O
speaking O
there O
. O

and O
he O
has O
got O
a O
guy O
by O
his O
side O
who O
can O
help O
make O
that O
happen O
. O

so O
i O
should O
n't O
have O
quoted O
him O
. O

i O
made O
a O
mistake O
there O
senator O
. O

you O
you O
you O
just O
jumped O
on O
me O
because O
i O
quoted O
him O
saying O
it O
would O
be O
all O
right O
if O
they O
lost O
the O
top O
ten B-CARDINAL
floors O
of O
the O
un B-FAC
. O

and O
and O
was O
i O
wrong O
to O
do O
that O
? O

no O
. O

it O
was O
a O
comment O
. O

it O
eh O
eh O
it O
was O
n't O
-- O
it O
was O
n't O
your O
quote O
. O

it O
was O
your O
comment O
eh O
that O
you O
said O
how O
would O
you O
feel O
if O
you O
were O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
floors O
. O

tell O
me O
what O
you O
should O
do O
here O
. O

that O
's O
what O
brabara B-PERSON
boxer I-PERSON
said O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
our O
hearings O
. O

oh O
did O
she O
say O
that O
? O

oh O
oh O
that O
was O
a O
mistake O
on O
my O
part O
. O

yeah O
absolutely O
. O

and O
the O
and O
the O
reality O
-- O
wait O
and O
the O
reality O
is O
again O
the O
context O
in O
which O
he O
said O
that O
was O
very O
clear O
i O
think O
few O
would O
argue O
with O
it O
and O
that O
is O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
a O
one B-CARDINAL
world O
government O
. O

the O
un B-ORG
is O
not O
going O
to O
dictate O
american B-NORP
foreign O
policy O
and O
how O
america B-GPE
defends O
itself O
. O

on O
the O
other O
hand O
we O
need O
to O
work O
with O
the O
un B-ORG
. O

john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
has O
showed O
the O
ability O
to O
do O
that O
. O

and O
i O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
mischaracterize O
him O
simply O
as O
a O
tough O
or O
a O
tough O
guy O
or O
a O
bully O
. O

did O
it O
bother O
you O
that O
when O
he O
filled O
out O
that O
questionnaire O
in O
the O
-- O
uh O
uh O
be- O
before O
your O
senate B-ORG
foreign I-ORG
relations I-ORG
committee I-ORG
your O
committee O
that O
he O
failed O
to O
note O
, O
in O
fact O
he O
denied O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
interviewed O
as O
part O
of O
the O
uh O
uh O
inspector O
general O
's O
investigation O
of O
the O
initial O
causes O
for O
the O
war O
in O
iraq B-GPE
? O

yeah O
it O
does O
bother O
-- O
it O
bothers O
me O
any O
time O
uh O
s- O
somebody O
says O
something O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
not O
to O
be O
accurate O
. O

on O
the O
other O
hand O
if O
he O
was O
simply O
somebody O
that O
somebody O
talked O
to O
but O
there O
is O
n't O
any O
indication O
he O
was O
involved O
central O
to O
the O
story O
i O
have O
less O
concern O
. O

but O
does O
it O
bother O
me O
? O

yes O
it O
did O
. O

i O
wish O
it O
did O
n't O
happen O
. O

do O
you O
think O
the O
un B-ORG
can O
still O
play O
the O
role O
that O
fdr B-PERSON
and O
the O
other O
americans B-NORP
at O
that O
time O
thought O
it O
could O
of O
being O
the O
peacemaking O
uh O
organization O
to O
keep O
us O
from O
fighting O
war O
after O
war O
in O
the O
world O
? O

can O
they O
ever O
play O
that O
role O
? O

chris B-PERSON
i O
i O
hope O
so O
. O

and O
i O
think O
that O
's O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
whole O
un B-ORG
reform O
effort O
. O

that O
's O
what O
this O
is O
about O
uh O
that O
we O
really O
do O
have O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the B-ORG
human I-ORG
rights I-ORG
commission I-ORG
. O

we O
have O
to O
change O
the O
focus O
of O
the O
un B-ORG
so O
they O
're O
not O
spending O
one B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
sixty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
on O
their O
communications O
department O
and O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
on O
their O
auditing O
function O
. O

uh O
we O
've O
got O
to O
do O
structural O
reform O
. O

we O
've O
-- O
we O
've O
got O
to O
do O
internal O
management O
reform O
. O

if O
it O
does O
that O
then O
in O
fact O
the O
un B-ORG
can O
live O
out O
what O
it O
-- O
what O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
. O

it O
's O
not O
doing O
that O
today B-DATE
. O

i O
'd O
like O
to O
change O
it O
because O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
us B-GPE
can O
be O
the O
so- O
world O
's O
sole O
peacekeeper O
and O
world O
's O
sole O
humanitarian O
providers O
. O

so O
we O
need O
an O
effective O
united B-ORG
nations I-ORG
. O

it O
's O
presently O
scarred O
presently O
tainted O
. O

uh O
let O
's O
get O
about O
reform O
. O

and O
hopefully O
it O
can O
get O
to O
where O
fdr B-PERSON
thought O
it O
could O
be O
. O

thank O
you O
very O
much O
sen- O

from O

to O
president O

's O
recent O
recess O

of O
john B-PERSON

plus O
what O
is O
the O
significance O
of O
the O
timing O
of O
today B-DATE

coming O
up O
, O
president O
bush B-PERSON
says O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
is O
the O
right O
person O
for O
the O
job O
. O

but O
democrats B-NORP
call O
him O
damaged O
goods O

the O

president O
bush B-PERSON
's O
recess O
appointment O
of O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
as O
un B-ORG
ambassador O
may O
be O
controversial O
among O
democrats B-NORP
. O

but O
it O
's O
not O
without O
precedent O
. O

and O
the O
move O
has O
energized O
both O
sides O
as O
they O
prepare O
for O
the O

hardball B-WORK_OF_ART

after O

bush B-PERSON
not O
to O
go O
through O
with O
this O
recess O
appointment O
the O
reaction O
today B-DATE
from O
democrats B-NORP
was O
harsh O
. O

this O
man O
uh O
sadly O
if O
we O
had O
a O
secret O
roll O
call O
would O
not O
be O
approved O
by O
the O
senate B-ORG
. O

both O
in O
the O
democratic B-NORP
and O
republicans B-NORP
sides O
serious O
misgivings O
about O
whether O
he O
has O
the O
qualifications O
for O
this O
important O
assignment O
. O

and O
some O
democrats B-NORP
said O
the O
president O
's O
action O
is O
a O
stick O
in O
the O
eye O
just O
as O
the O
senate B-ORG
is O
preparing O
for O

hearings O
of O
john B-PERSON
roberts I-PERSON
the O
president O

nominee O

this O
president O
has O
more O
disdain O
for O
the O

states I-GPE
congress B-ORG
than O
any O
president O
i O
've O
seen O
in O
my O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
there O
. O

the O
president O
's O
power O
to O
make O
recess O

comes O
from O
the O

and O
it O
's O
a O
power O
that O
dates O
back O
to O
george B-PERSON

andrea B-PERSON
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
paradigms O
for O
un B-ORG
ambassador O
. O

there O
's O
adlai B-PERSON
stevenson I-PERSON
the O
old O
liberal O
who O
really O
came O
through O
during O
the B-EVENT
cuban I-EVENT
missile I-EVENT
crisis I-EVENT
because O
everybody O
in O
the O
world O
believed O
he O
was O
n't O
a O
hawk O
. O

and O
then O
there O
was O
daniel B-PERSON
patrick I-PERSON
moynihan I-PERSON
who O
went O
over O
there O
and O
took O
took O
on O
the B-LOC
third I-LOC
world I-LOC
on O
issues O
like O
uh O
the O
issues O
of O
anti-israel B-GPE
sort O
of O
rhetoric O
over O
there O
and O
he O
won O
those O
battles O
. O

what O
are O
we O
looking O
at O
here O
a O
smart O
diplomat O
or O
a O
tough O
talker O
? O

i O
think O
a O
tough O
talker O
. O

but O
what O
he O
needs O
to O
learn O
and O
what O
i O
think O
he O
's O
been O
warned O
about O
uh O
from O
diplomats O
up O
there O
is O
that O
you O
need O
votes O
. O

and O
he O
ca O
n't O
go O
in O
with O
a O
mandate O
that O
the O
president O
has O
given O
him O
to O
shake O
the O
place O
up O
with O
some O
of O
those O
pungent O
sound O
bites O
and O
get O
along O
with O
enough O
people O
especially O
because O
his O
own O
credibility O
was O
really O
on O
the O
line O
on O
some O
of O
the O
tough O
issues O
that O
he O
's O
going O
to O
confront O
iran B-GPE
iraq B-GPE
north B-GPE
korea I-GPE
. O

so O
since O
he O
's O
been O
accused O
of O
twisting O
the O
intelligence O
on O
exactly O
those O
issues O
he O
needs O
some O
allies O
. O

and O
he O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
develop O
those O
allies O
now O
. O

he O
will O
have O
the O
brits B-NORP
and O
some O
of O
the O
other O
traditional O
american B-NORP
allies O
. O

but O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
goodwill O
up O
there O
. O

that O
said O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
has O
experience O
. O

he O
was O
very O
successful O
in O
a O
previous O
incarnation O
in O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
when O
he O
was O
able O
to O
defeat O
the O
zionism B-NORP
is O
racism O
uh O
resolution O
there O
back O
then O
. O

and O
he O
's O
a O
smart O
guy O
. O

so O
i O
would O
n't O
bet O
against O
him O
. O

what O
about O
the O
the O
european B-NORP
and O
the O
world O
press O
. O

are O
they O
going O
to O
destroy O
him O
before O
he O
gets O
started O
for O
being O
a O
recess O
appointment O
? O

sure O
but O
kofi B-PERSON
annan I-PERSON
look O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
strength O
himself O
especially O
with O
critics O
here O
in O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
. O

so O
while O
he O
would O
like O
to O
warn O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
as O
he O
did O
today B-DATE
that O
there O
are O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
ninety I-CARDINAL
other O
representatives O
the O
us B-GPE
has O
a O
certain O
special O
clout O
. O

and O
annan B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
him O
. O

uh O
i O
guess O
that O
if O
bolton B-PERSON
had O
not O
said O
some O
of O
the O
things O
that O
he O
had O
said O
in O
the O
past O
that O
you O
know O
the O
un B-ORG
secretariat O
has O
thirty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
eight I-CARDINAL
floors O
and O
you O
could O
lose O
ten B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
without O
losing O
anything O
those O
kinds O
of O
quotes O
are O
going O
to O
kind O
of O
haunt O
him O
. O

do O
you O
think O
there O
's O
any O
danger O
in O
the O
world O
of O
causing O
a O
real O
war O
in O
north B-GPE
korea I-GPE
again O
another B-EVENT
korean I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
by O
calling O
the O
north B-NORP
korean I-NORP
dictator O
what O
he O
is O
? O

i O
mean O
he O
calls O
him O
a O
tyrannical O
dictator O
. O

and O
he O
says O
he O
's O
-- O
it O
's O
a O
nightmare O
all O
over O
there O
. O

all O
true O
. O

but O
here O
's O
a O
guy O
on O
jack B-PRODUCT
daniels I-PRODUCT
most O
of O
the O
time O
in O
a O
world O
of O
delusion O
. O

is O
there O
any O
chance O
he O
might O
just O
rattle O
that O
cage O
too O
hard O
? O

well O
actually O
condi B-PERSON
rice I-PERSON
herself O
in O
her O
own O
confirmation O
hearing O
had O
rattled O
that O
cage O
. O

and O
they O
've O
walked O
way O
back O
from O
that O
. O

what O
rice B-PERSON
is O
proving O
as O
secretary O
is O
that O
she O
's O
much O
more O
pragmatic O
as O
secretary O
of O
state B-ORG
than O
she O
was O
a O
national O
security O
adviser O
on O
iran B-GPE
and O
on O
north B-GPE
korea I-GPE
. O

so O
she O
's O
taken O
this O
this O
posture O
she O
's O
reflecting O
the O
president O
's O
view O
as O
adjusted O
for O
second B-ORDINAL
term O
and O
bolton B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
to O
follow O
that O
line O
. O

he O
ca O
n't O
really O
go O
off O
on O
his O
own O
. O

and O
if O
he O
does O
i O
think O
she O
'll O
reel O
him O
right O
back O
in O
. O

how O
many O
months B-DATE
before O
condi B-PERSON
rice I-PERSON
has O
to O
apologize O
or O
defend O
uh O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
his O
language O
? O

maybe O
two B-CARDINAL
. O

okay O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
andrea B-PERSON
mitchell I-PERSON
. O

two B-DATE
months I-DATE
it O
is O

i O
'm O
joined O

steve B-PERSON
mcmahon I-PERSON
democratic B-NORP
political O

i O
did O
n't O

he O

long O
and O
ben B-PERSON

a O
republican B-NORP
attorney O
and O
adviser O
to O
the O
conservative O
group O
progress B-ORG
for I-ORG
america I-ORG
and O
also O
a O
man O
whose O
card O
has O
been O
stamped O
by O
working O
hard O
to O
win O
the O
president O
's O

in O
florida B-GPE
right O
? O

yes O
sir O
. O

does O
n't O
it O
seem O
to O
you O
that O
people O
like O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
and O
john B-PERSON
roberts I-PERSON
the O
un O
-- O
the O
uh O
the O
uh O
supreme B-ORG
court I-ORG
nominee O
have O
all O
earned O
their O
spurs O
through O
this O
sort O
of O
red O
badge O
of O
courage O
down O
in O
the O
florida B-GPE
recount O
? O

i O
think O
it O
was O
the O
other O
way O
around O
. O

i O
think O
in O
florida B-GPE
we O
recruited O
the O
best O
and O
the O
brightest O
and O
people O
with O
who O
we O
knew O
would O
be O
excellent O
in O
really O
a O
tough O
and O
historical O
setting O
and O
that O
's O
where O
those O
guys O
came O
in O
. O

is O
that O
where O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
learned O
how O
to O
be O
so O
belligerent O
down O
there O
in O
uh O
- O

okay O
let O
me O
ask O
this O
were O
they O
-- O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
a O
tough O
shot O
. O

the O
democrats B-NORP
who O
voted O
against O
bolton B-PERSON
and O
denied O
him O
an O
up O
or O
down O
vote O
in O
the O
senate B-ORG
were O
n't O
they O
just O
in O
a O
certain O
way O
trying O
to O
separate O
themselves O
from O
having O
voted O
for O
the O
war O
? O

this O
is O
their O
chance O
to O
basically O
say O
to O
the O
president O
and O
to O
the O
country O
we O
're O
not O
part O
of O
this O
war O
policy O
of O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
and O
the O
president O
. O

i O
actually O
think O
it O
was O
-- O
it O
was O
their O
chance O
to O
stand O
up O
and O
say O
we O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
somebody O
who O
was O
an O
architect O
of O
a O
war O
, O
who O
was O
an O
architect O
of O
the O
misleading O
information O
that O
we O
got O
and O
that O
the O
world O
got O
. O

many O
of O
the O
world O
uh O
then O
later O
followed O
us O
into O
war O
- O

if O
they O
bought O
it O
back O
before O
why O
are O
they O
not O
buying O
it O
now O
? O

well O
because O
they O
've O
-- O
they O
've O
learned O
from O
their O
mistake O
. O

i O
mean O
obviously O
you O
know O
when O
you O
-- O
when O
you O
lead O
a O
nation O
and O
a O
world O
into O
war O
um O
and O
you O
are O
-- O
eh O
and O
you O
have O
the O
kind O
of O
record O
that O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
has O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
went O
to O
florida B-GPE
and O
fought O
in O
the O
recount O
i O
think O
it O
you O
know O
the O
democrats B-NORP
got O
smart O
. O

is O
your O
party O
ready O
now O
to O
come O
out O
against O
this O
war O
. O

or O
are O
they O
still O
going O
to O
play O
it O
both O
ways O
? O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
party O
is O
playing O
it O
both O
ways O
. O

i O
think O
our O
party O
is O
going O
to O
hold O
our O
president O
accountable O
. O

oh O
yes O
they O
are O
. O

support O
the O
troops O

more O
armor O

eh O
uh O
are O
you O

but O
chris B-PERSON
you O
can O
be O
against O

and O
be O
in O

of O
the O

uh O
uh O
you O
know O
i O
think O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
pe- O
- O

you O
ca O
n't O
answer O
that O
, O
can O

well O
of O
course O
the B-ORG

them O
what O
it O

- O

have O
you O
got O
a O
party O
on O
taxes O
on O

what O
is O
your O
position O

whether O
we O

well O
i O
think O
we O
should O
roll O

the O
president O

does O
the B-ORG
democratic I-ORG
party I-ORG
believe O
that O

i O
think O
the O
presiden- O

the B-ORG
democratic I-ORG
party I-ORG
has O
said O
you O
know O
the O
problem O
is O
- O

the B-ORG
republican I-ORG
party I-ORG
is O
for O
the O

there O
there O
's O
a O
beauty O
here O
to O
this O
kind O
of O
symmetry O
here O
. O

well O
absolutely O
. O

the O
republicans B-NORP
know O
where O
they O
stand O
. O

the O
democrats B-NORP
they O
are O
still O
looking O
for O
an O
opportunity O
. O

no O
no O
no O
. O

the O
democrats O
the O
democrats B-NORP
believe O
that O
the O
president O
has O
driven O
this O
country O
into O
a O
recession O
. O

the O
economy O
is O
is O
on O
the O
wrong O
track O
. O

so O
therefore O
what O
are O
you O
going O
to O
do O
about O
it O

a O
principled O
guy O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
skills O
. O

he O
has O
the O
support O
of O
the O
president O
of O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
the O
secretary O
of O
state B-ORG
a O
majority O
of O
the O

kofi O

. O

the B-ORG
united I-ORG
nations I-ORG
is O
doing O
important O
reform O
work O
. O

and O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
is O
the O
right O
guy O
. O

and O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
in O
and O
do O
his O
job O
and O
not O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
carping O
from O
the O
democrats B-NORP
. O

he O
's O
basically O
going O
to O
waste O
the O
other O
side O
the O
third B-LOC
world I-LOC
people O
and O
just O
and O
just O
blow O
them O
up O
every B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

no O
absolutely O
not O
. O

that O
's O
not O
his O
mandate O
and O
goal O
. O

his O
mandate O
and O
goal O
is O
to O
fulfill O
the O
foreign O
policy O
of O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
. O

and O
that O
absolutely O
includes O
helping O
the O
people O
of O
the B-LOC
third I-LOC
world I-LOC
. O

he O
is O
so O
good O
, O
is O
n't O
he O
? O

he O
's O
so O
good O
. O

i O
think O
it O
's O
like O
sending O
frank B-PERSON
rizzo I-PERSON
to O
the O
un B-ORG
. O

but O
that O
's O
just O
a O
thought O
you O
know O
. O

a O
tough O
customer O
a O
tough O
cop O
or O
else O
how O
about O
hall O
monitor O
. O

yeah O
exactly O
. O

you O
know O
one O
of O
these O
tough O
guys O
to O
go O
get O
these O
bozos O
in O
line O
. O

i O
mean O
i O
'm O
talking O
from O
the O
the O
subjunctive O
mood O
of O
this O
administration O
. O

well O
he O
obviously O
thinks O
he O
he O
is O
a O
hall O
monitor O
. O

i O
mean O
you O
you O
know O
the O
president O
may O
refer O
to O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
as O
the O
architect O
. O

but O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
is O
the O
architect O
of O
a O
misleading O
misleading O
the O
country O
misleading O
the O
world O
into O
a O
war O
. O

and O
um O
and O
then O
you O
know O
basically O
during O
his O
confirmation O
hearings O
he O
was O
asked O
whether O
he O
had O
ever O
been O
in- O
interrogated O
as O
part O
of O
an O
investigation O
. O

he O
did O
n't O
tell O
the O
truth O
about O
that O
. O

i O
mean O
this O
is O
an O
administration O
that O
that O
basically O
is O
rewarding O
somebody O
for O
not O
telling O
the O
truth O
consistently O
over O
a O
long O
period O
of O
time O
and O
for O
-- O
and O
for O
belligerently O
abusing O
his O
staff O
. O

i O
i O
do O
n't O
believe O
in O
the O
-- O
in O
the O
senate B-ORG
debate O
. O

your O
party O
stuck O
by O
what O
you O
just O
said O
about O
blaming O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
for O
the O
war O
. O

in O
fact O
they O
sort O
of O
nickeled O
and O
dimed O
him O
on O
not O
giving O
him O
a O
fair O
up O
or O
down O
vote O
on O
much O
less O
relevant O
points O
. O

we O
do O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
papers O
that O
we O
think O
we O
need O
. O

and O
they O
kept O
playing O
that O
sort O
of O
rope O
a O
dope O
game O
. O

there O
was O
nothing O
about O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
as O
the O
architect O
for O
the O
war O
. O

it O
was O
a O
much O
shriller O
sort O
of O
less O
relevant O
debate O
that O
you O
guys O
did O
. O

could O
n't O
could O
n't O
the O
strategy O
of O
the O
president O
be O
this O
guy O
is O
going O

the O
united B-GPE
states I-GPE
senate B-ORG
eventually O
confirm O
this O
guy O
to O
a O
full O
appointment O
. O

yeah O
i O
think O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
surprise O
people O
the O
un B-ORG
- O

will O
they O
-- O
will O
that O
happen O
? O

yes O
depending O
on O
the O
election O
results O
. O

oh O
depending O
on O
- O

what O
do O
you O
mean O
? O

well O
the O
he O
is O
-- O
his O
his O
term O
ends O
in O
january B-DATE
of I-DATE
oh I-DATE
seven I-DATE
. O

there O
are O
senate B-ORG
elections O
in O
november B-DATE
of I-DATE
oh I-DATE
six I-DATE
. O

so O
if O
your O
party O
picks O
up O
seats O
he O
'll O
get O
confirmed O
? O

yeah O
when O
we O
pick O
up O
the O
five B-CARDINAL
seats O
to O
give O
us O
filibuster O
proof O
. O

it O
will O
be O
easy O
. O

and O
without O
that O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
performance O
will O
do O
it O
. O

what O
a O
standard O
you O
're O
setting O
. O

in O
other O
words O
if O
they O
get O
a O
veto O
uh O
uh O
uh O
what O
do O
you O
call O
it O
a O
fili- O
filibuster O
proof O
majority O
- O

he O
'll O
-- O
he O
will O
-- O
he O
will O
go O
up O
-- O
he O
will O
go O
up O
and O
get O
confirmed O
anyways O
because O
of O
the O
job O
he O
's O
going O
to O
do O
. O

somebody O
somebody O
said O
on O
one O
of O
the O
weekend B-DATE
shows O
i O
think O
they O
're O
right O
if O
it O
were O
a O
secret O
vote O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
would O
n't O
carry O
the O
republican B-NORP
caucus O
. O

and O
i O
think O
that O
's O
absolutely O
right O
. O

and O
if O
it O
were O
an O
up O
or O
down O
vote O
he O
would O
have O
been O
confirmed O
because O
he O
had O
a O
majority O
of O
support O
in O
the O
senate B-ORG
. O

do O
you O
think O
he O
would O
carry O
the O
republican B-NORP
caucus O
vote O
? O

yes O
he O
had O
a O
majority O
-- O
he O
had O
a O
majority O
of O
support O
on O
the O
cloture O
petitions O
. O

it O
was O
n't O
enough O
to O
get O
sixty B-CARDINAL
. O

are O
we O
going O
anywhere O
in O
this O
uh O
cia B-ORG
investigation O
? O

here O
's O
the O
question O
i O
ask O
you O
. O

will O
this O
end O
up O
in O
a O
simple O
report O
from O
uh O
from O
patrick B-PERSON
fitzgerald I-PERSON
the O
investigator O
the O
prosecutor O
from O
chicago B-GPE
. O

or O
will O
he O
end O
up O
with O
some O
really O
serious O
indictments O
ben B-PERSON
ginsberg I-PERSON
? O

i O
think O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
. O

but O
no O
it O
does O
n't O
appear O
like O
right O
now O
that O
there O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
uh O
indictments O
certainly O
on O
the O
leak O
. O

but O
there O
is O
it O
seems O
a O
lot O
going O
on O
beneath O
the O
surface O
and O
certainly O
a O
lot O
of O
speculation O
uh O
going O
on O
in O
washington B-GPE
. O

so O
you O
're O
not O
-- O
you O
're O
betting O
against O
perjury O
indictments O
? O

i O
would O
-- O
i O
i O
would O
-- O
i O
would O
suspect O
no O
. O

obstruction O
of O
justice O
indictments O
. O

but O
as O
i O
say O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
going O
on O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
perjury O
or O
obstruction O
if O
there O
are O
indictments O
at O
all O
. O

i O
i O
i O
think O
it O
's O
pretty O
difficult O
to O
have O
an O
investigation O
of O
this O
length O
at O
this O
cost O
to O
put O
a O
new B-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
uh O
reporter O
in O
jail O
for O
this O
length O
of O
time O
. O

steve B-PERSON
did O
n't O
they O
work O
for O
the O
secretary O
of O
agriculture O
for O
years B-DATE
and O
go O
for O
like B-DATE
three I-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

and O
they O
never O
got O
anything O
on O
the O
guy O
? O

. O

well O
this O
investigation O
they O
never O
put O
a O
reporter O
in O
jail O
-- O
they O
never O
put O
a O
reporter O
in O
jail O
for O
something O
. O

in O
fact O
it O
's O
never O
happened O
before O
. O

. O

they O
got O
him O
with O
the O
basketball O
tickets O
. O

but O
she O
's O
not O
talking O
. O

they O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
witness O
. O

well O
they O
've O
got O
plenty O
of O
witnesses O
. O

and O
they O
have O
got O
plenty O
-- O
they O
have O
got O
plenty O
of O
ammunition O
. O

what O
do O
you O
think O
charge- O
- O

steve B-PERSON
what O
's O
the O
charge O
going O
to O
be O
? O

i O
think O
-- O
i O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
see O
perjury O
or O
obstruction O
of O
justice O
because O
i O
i O
frankly O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
on O
a O
-- O
on O
a O
technical O
specific O
intent O
crime O
like O
the O
one O
that O
was O
originally O
alleged O
they O
're O
going O
to O
-- O
they O
're O
going O
to O
probably O
return O
an O
indictment O
because O
it O
's O
a O
specific O
intent O
crime O
. O

but O
on O
obstruction O
and O
on O
perjury O
it O
looks O
like O
there O
's O
plenty O
of O
room O
. O

joe B-PERSON
wilson I-PERSON
says O
that O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
will O
be O
frog O
- O
walked O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
white I-FAC
house I-FAC
. O

uh O
uh O
he O
means O
in O
chains O
. O

do O
you O
think O
that O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
? O

i O
i O
think O
that O
's O
unlikely O
. O

unlikely O
. O

this O
investigation O
got O
so O
much O
scrutiny O
from O
the O
media O
when O
it O
started O
that O
if O
you O
were O
going O
to O
do O
a O
no O
prosecution O
in O
this O
case O
you O
would O
have O
to O
ask O
a O
huge O
number O
of O
questions O
just O
as O
the O
prosecutor O
is O
doing O
to O
be O
able O
to O
come O
up O
with O
that O
no O
prosecution O
. O

you O
know O
what O
i O
think O
? O

by O
the O
way O
- O

i O
think O
they O
've O
got O
a O
huge O
paper O
trail O
. O

they O
've O
been O
interviewing O
people O
interrogating O
them O
before O
a O
grand O
jury O
for O
months B-DATE
. O

they O
have O
so O
many O
potential O
contradictions O
. O

and O
having O
watched O
what O
this O
fellow O
pet- O
uh O
patrick B-PERSON
fitzgerald I-PERSON
did O
in O
chicago B-GPE
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
ago I-DATE
with O
the O
adm- O
daley B-PERSON
administration O
where O
he O
took O
down O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
top O
guys O
on O
patronage O
which O
most O
people O
would O
say O
is O
n't O
that O
what O
they O
do O
out O
there O
in O
chicago B-GPE
, O
i O
think O
he O
's O
serious O
business O
. O

i O
would O
look O
out O
for O
this O
guy O
if O
i O
were O
in O
the O
-- O
in O
the O
white B-ORG
house I-ORG
staff O
. O

yeah O
and O
by O
the O
way O
i O
was O
-- O
i O
was O
commenting O
on O
the O
frog O
- O
walk O
. O

i O
think O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
may O
have O
a O
real O
problem O
on O
his O
hands O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
'll O
be O
frog O
- O
walked O
. O

i O
think O
if O
there O
's O
any O
way O
the O
president O
can O
stand O
by O
his O
man O
he O
will O
but O
it O
's O
going O
to O
get O
maybe O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
difficult O
for O
him O
to O
do O
that O
. O

is O
anybody O
going O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
white B-ORG
house I-ORG
staff O
who O
has O
been O
indicted O
ben B-PERSON
? O

once O
indicted O
. O

i O
think O
once O
you O
're O
indicted O
it O
's O
difficult O
to O
keep O
anyone O
on O
a O
white B-ORG
house I-ORG
staff O
. O

do O
you O
think O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
the O
big O
second B-ORDINAL
term O
booboo O
of O
this O
administration O
? O

like O
they O
always O
seem O
to O
have O
one B-CARDINAL
. O

this O
president O
has O
n't O
suffered O
one B-CARDINAL
yet O
. O

iran B-EVENT

monica B-PERSON
they O
all O
seem O
to O

a O

uh O
ba- O
uh O
you O
know O
sherman B-PERSON
adams I-PERSON
with O
eisenhower B-PERSON
the O
court O
packing O
by O
fdr B-PERSON
. O

it O
's O
almost O
automatic O
this O
second B-ORDINAL
term O
problem O
. O

and O
if O
-- O
and O
if O
you O
look O
at O
the O
way O
they O
've O
handled O
this O
publicly O
ba- O
basically O
if O
they O
handled O
it O
within O
the O
grand O

the O
same O
way O
they O
handled O
it O
publicly O
by O
dissembling O

misleading O
and O
in O
some O
cases O
maybe O
ou- O
outright O
misrepresentation O
of O
the O
truth O
it O
it O
it O
it O
seems O
pretty O
likely O
that O
it O
's O
going O
to O
lead O
to O
some O
criminal O
activity O
because O
this O
guy O
is O
there O
to O
do O
a O
job O
and O
he O
's O
not O
a O
partisan O
but O
he O
's O
a O
very O
tough O
prosecutor O
. O

in O
fact O
he O
was O
originally O
uh O
an O
appointee O
of O
the O
president O
's O
father O
. O

so O
this O
is O
not O
a O
democratic B-NORP
witch O
hunt O
. O

it O
's O
a O
very O
serious O
matter O
. O

and O
i O
think O
you O
know O
these O
guys O
may O
have O
some O
problems O
on O
their O
hand O
. O

ben B-PERSON
do O
you O
think O
. O

a O
lot O
of O
fights O
that O
have O
been O
going O
on O
last B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
days I-DATE
whether O
it O
's O
the O
j- O
nomination O
to O
the B-ORG
united I-ORG
nations I-ORG
of O
john B-PERSON
bolton I-PERSON
the O
issue O
of O
the O
-- O
of O
the O
the O
leak O
investigation O
if O
you O
write O
the O
history O
now O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
from I-DATE
now I-DATE
, O
what O
the O
real O
fight O
is O
about O
is O
the O
recriminations O
over O
whether O
we O
should O
have O
gone O
to O
war O
. O

and O
that O
is O
what O
the O
fight O
is O
about O
. O

well O
i O
'm O
not O
sure O
i O
agree O
with O
that O
. O

it O
seems O
to O
me O
the O
overlook O
story O
is O
the O
real O
accomplishments O
of O
the O
congress B-ORG
bipartisan O
uh O
on O
friday B-DATE
and O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

yeah O
. O

you O
had O
energy O
. O

you O
had O
transportation O
. O

uh O
you O
've O
had O
tort O
reform O
. O

you O
've O
had O
bankruptcy O
bills O
. O

you O
got O
an O
economy O
that O
's O
going O
along O
uh O
pretty O
well O
. O

this O
has O
been O
an O
aura O
of O
-- O
an O
era O
of O
achievement O
for O
the O
president O
. O

and O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
be O
going O
back O
looking O
at O
this B-DATE
period I-DATE
in I-DATE
time I-DATE
uh O
in O
that O
-- O
in O
that O
lens O
yeah O
. O

as O
fail O
period O
. O

uh O
i O
i O
think O
the O
story O
of O
this O
administration O
especially O
this O
this O
second B-ORDINAL
term O
is O
arrogance O
and O
abuse O
of O
power O
. O

i O
mean O
basically O
anybody O
who O
gets O
in O
their O
way O
they O
knock O
down O
. O

as O
bad O
as O
fdr B-PERSON
in O
the O
second O
term O
? O

worse O
worse O
chris B-PERSON
way O
- O

as O
clinton B-PERSON
during O
lewinsky B-PERSON
? O

well O
you O
know O
uh O
we O
've O
learned O
that O
perjury O
is O
a O
problem O
for O
public O
officials O
. O

and O
we O
learned O
it O
from O
so- O
a O
matter O
as O
unusual O
as O
clinton B-PERSON
and O
monica B-PERSON
. O

but O
in O
fact O
ben B-PERSON
i O
think O
i O
sat O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
shows O
with O
you O
talking O
about O
that O
very O
subject O
. O

and O
you O
had O
a O
differen- O
-- O
you O
were O
singing O
a O
different O
tune O
then O
, O
were O
n't O
you O
? O

okay O
we O
learned O
a O
lot O
tonight B-TIME
. O

not O
be O
? O

in O
early O
early B-DATE
two I-DATE
thousand I-DATE
seven I-DATE
because O
the O
senate B-ORG

be O
packed O
with O
republicans B-NORP

no O
because O
he O
's O
going O

do O
such O
a O
good O
job O
he O
's O
going O
to O
deserve O

with O
melanie B-PERSON
just O
back O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
ago I-DATE
what O
did O
you O
smell O
over O
there O
? O

what O
did O
you O
see O
? O

well O
first O
of O
all O
it O
was O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
and I-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
degrees I-QUANTITY
in O
the O
shade O
in O
iraq B-GPE

um O
and O
when O
you O
're O
wearing O
like O
i O
was O
twenty B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
of O
body O
armor O
um O
and O
sweating O
through O
your O
clothes O
and O
trying O
to O
stay O
hydrated O
um O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
sandstorm O
um O
where O
we O
were O
trapped O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
different O
occasions O
it O
was O
pretty O
grueling O
tough O
work O
and O
an O
assignment O
that O
made O
me O
have O
a O
tremendous O
appreciation O
of O
what O
our O
troops O
are O
going O
through O
on O
a O
day O
to O
day O
basis O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

what O
did O
you O
-- O
what O
did O
you O
get O
from O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
? O

do O
they O
like O
us O
. O

do O
they O
dislike O
us O
. O

are O
they O
neutral O
? O

are O
they O
waiting O
to O
see O
who O
wins O
or O
what O
? O

i O
think O
that O
many O
of O
of O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
at O
least O
the O
ones O
with O
whom O
i O
spoke O
felt O
very O
strongly O
that O
they O
appreciated O
the O
american B-NORP
presence O
there O
. O

they O
are O
obviously O
extremely O
concerned O
about O
the O
level O
of O
violence O
that O
is O
is O
coming O
from O
the O
insurgency O
. O

but O
there O
's O
a O
reason O
for O
it O
. O

and O
you O
have O
n't O
heard O
this O
discussed O
in O
the O
mainstream O
media O
because O
nobody O
has O
brought O
it O
up O
. O

the O
reason O
why O
they O
are O
concerned O
is O
because O
they O
know O
that O
the O
upcoming O
august O
and O
december O
referential O
-- O
uh O
the O
constitutional O
referendum O
is O
terribly O
important O
. O

the O
insurgency O
made O
a O
strategic O
and O
tactical O
error O
by O
not O
disrupting O
the O
last O
election O
back O
in O
january B-DATE
. O

they O
know O
that O
it O
's O
coming O
time O
around O
. O

but O
if O
those O
elections O
go O
successfully O
as O
the O
american B-NORP
military O
is O
hoping O
and O
planning O
for O
as O
well O
as O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
army O
then O
they O
're O
-- O
we O
are O
going O
to O
start O
discussing O
the O
possibility O
of O
drawing O
down O
down O
our O
troops O
. O

and O
that O
's O
something O
that O
i O
learned O
and O
reported O
on O
while O
i O
was O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
it O
was O
n't O
until O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
later I-DATE
i O
finally O
started O
seeing O
something O
in O
the O
front O
pages O
of O
the O
daily O
newspapers O
. O

paul B-PERSON
you O
helped O
fight O
that O
war O
. O

your O
reaction O
to O
what O
melanie B-PERSON
just O
said O
? O

well O
i O
think O
it O
's O
great O
that O
some O
reporters O
are O
headed O
over O
there O
and O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
taste O
and O
a O
feel O
for O
what O
soldiers O
like O
me O
lived O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

and O
i O
was O
there O
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
in O
central B-LOC
baghdad I-LOC
. O

and O
i O
saw O
the O
good O
the O
bad O
and O
everything O
in O
between O
. O

and O
i O
think O
reporters O
need O
to O
really O
continue O
to O
go O
outside O
their O
area O
of O
comfortability O
outside O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
. O

but O
i O
think O
the O
reality O
is O
that O
ms. O
morgan B-PERSON
like O
most O
reporters O
are O
really O
spoon O
- O
fed O
uh O
their O
experience O
there O
. O

they O
're O
prada- O
-- O
they O
're O
provided O
with O
with O
dod B-ORG
contractors O
or O
uh O
military O
security O
personnel O
. O

and O
what O
they O
get O
is O
a O
very O
narrow O
understanding O
of O
what O
the O
day O
to O
day O
life O
is O
. O

not O
enough O
reporters O
are O
really O
going O
outside O
of O
that O
comfortability O
factor O
and O
going O
beyond O
that O
to O
try O
to O
experience O
what O
we O
as O
soliders O
experience O
. O

what O
makes O
-- O
wha- O
what O
what O
makes O
you O
assume O
that O
i O
stayed O
inside O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
? O

that O
's O
another O
thing O
that O
you O
've O
written O
about O
me O
that O
is O
a O
lie O
. O

that O
's O
not O
what O
i O
said O
ma'am O
. O

what O
i O
said O
was O
that O
you O
did O
n't O
get O
out O
of O
your O
comfortbility O
zone O
. O

what O
you O
- O

if O
i O
could O
finish O
i O
'll O
respond O
. O

i O
think O
that O
you O
were O
there O
for O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

and O
i O
think O
you O
got O
your O
feet O
wet O
. O

and O
that O
's O
nice O
. O

but O
then O
you O
back O
to O
your O
comfortable O
house O
in O
the O
civilian O
world O
. O

and O
the O
soliders O
stayed O
there O
. O

excuse O
me O
paul B-PERSON
. O

i O
think O
if O
you O
really O
wanted O
a O
taste O
of O
that O
experience O
you O
could O
spend O
more O
time O
there O
. O

excuse O
me O
paul B-PERSON
. O

i O
have O
spent O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
as O
as O
a O
correspondant O
. O

i O
was O
in O
bejing B-GPE
when O
when O
college O

were O
being O
murdered O

i O
covered O
their O
dead O

i O
have O
been O
to O
beirut B-GPE
in O
nineteen B-DATE
eighty I-DATE

i O
've O

i O
have O
ha- O

let O
me O
go O

melanie B-PERSON
i O
want O
to O
get O
some O
reporting O
here O
an O
opportunity O
to O
report O
. O

when O
you O
talked O
to O
regular O
iraqis B-NORP
what O
were O
they O
telling O
you O
? O

did O
you O
get O
a O
sense O
- O

i O
know O
you O
could O
n't O
take O
a O
poll O
in O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

but O
what O
were O
they O
saying O
about O
our O
presence O
? O

many O
of O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
were O
fearful O
because O
of O
the O
extraordinary O
level O
of O
ied O
improvised O
explosive O
devices O
that O
were O
going O
off O
and O
killing O
people O
. O

but O
here O
's O
the O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
. O

the B-DATE
day I-DATE
that O
i O
was O
there O
there O
were O
-- O
uh O
there O
were O
thirty B-CARDINAL

school O
children O
who O
were O
killed O
about B-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
blocks O
away O
from O
where O
i O
was O
located O
because O
an O
american B-NORP
soldier O
had O
the O
audacity O
to O
hand O
them O
candy O
because O
we O
were O
at O
the O
same O
time O
passing O
out O
soccer O
balls O
um O
at O
orphanages O
. O

we O
we O
talked O
to O
these O
people O
. O

they O
are O
grateful O
because O
we O
are O
feeding O
and O
helping O
to O
train O
these O
people O
to O
take O
over O
the O
responsibility O
for O
their O
government O

and O
it O
's O
a O
responsibility O
chris B-PERSON
that O
they O
are O
very O
eager O
to O
assume O

do O
you O
believe O
this O
is O
to O
me O
- O

i O
'm O
not O
over O
there O
. O

i O
have O
n't O
been O
over O

the O
question O
i O
want O
to O
know O
is O
who O
is O
going O
to O
win O
this O
war O
based O
on O
fighting O
zeal O

we O
saw O
for O
years O

everybody O
else O
knows O
for O

the O
minority O
in O

those O

what O
i O

is O
that O
when O
i O

iraqi B-NORP
general O

and O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
is O
the O
iraqis O
keep O

no O

how O
many O

they O
come O

they O
-- O
and O
and O
more O
people O
-- O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
as O
many O
people O
joined O
that O
line O
at O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
police O
recruiting O
station O
after O
the O

you O

you O
can O
not O
breathe O

at O
these O
people O
without O
them O
breathing O
it O
in O
inhaling O
it O
and O
enjoying O
and O
wanting O
it O
even O
more O
badly O
. O

the O
same O
question O
to O
you O
paul B-PERSON
. O

you O
know O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
world B-EVENT
war I-EVENT
two I-EVENT
the O
worst O
thing O
that O
happened O
uh O
in O
the O
century O
uh O
the O
uh O
the O
french B-NORP
army O
was O
bigger O
and O
more O
impressive O
than O
the O
german B-NORP
army O
. O

but O
the O
german B-NORP
army O
wanted O
to O
kill O
. O

it O
wanted O
to O
take O
land O
. O

it O
had O
revenge O
in O
its O
heart O
. O

it O
had O
that O
ferocity O
of O
the O
fighter O
. O

the O
french B-NORP
did O
not O
. O

they O
wanted O
the O
thing O
over O
with O
. O

they O
wanted O
the O
phony O
war O
to O
continue O
. O

do O
you O
think O
the O
shia B-NORP
who O
are O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
new O
government O
have O
that O
fighting O
hatred O
or O
whatever O
you O
want O
to O
call O
it O
the O
zeal O
to O
defeat O
bullies O
this O
time O
. O

or O
are O
we O
going O
to O
lose O
this O
fight O
? O

. O

you O
know O
i O
think O
that O
's O
the O
bigger O
question O
. O

and O
the O
bigger O
question O
is O
are O
we O
winning O
or O
are O
we O
losing O
? O

are O
we O
making O
more O
than O
we O
're O
killing O
? O

and O
i O
think O
that O
's O
the O
real O
question O
we O
have O
to O
answer O
. O

and O
day O
to O
day O
what O
i O
saw O
was O
that O
we O
were O
in O
the O
macro-perspective O
making O
more O
enemies O
than O
we O
're O
killing O
. O

and O
this O
goes O
beyond O
iraq B-GPE
. O

how O
are O
we O
doing O
that O
? O

what O
did O
you O
see O
? O

by O
by O
our O
occupation O
and O
also O
by O
our O
bullying O
tactics O
by O
our O
failure O
to O
offer O
economic O
solutions O
and O
diplomatic O
solutions O
our O
failure O
to O
have O
enough O
interpreters O
on O
the O
ground O
our O
failure O
to O
provide O
a O
secure O
situation O
. O

we O
've O
never O
had O
enough O
troops O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

and O
when O
i O
got O
to O
baghdad B-GPE
at O
the O
outset O
we O
could O
n't O
provide O
overwhelming O
force O
to O
establish O
security O
. O

and O
we O
've O
been O
playing O
catchup O
*ever O
ever O
since O
. O

should O
we O
have O
gone O
in O
not O
gone O
in O
or O
gone O
in O
with O
greater O
strength O
? O

of O
those O
three B-CARDINAL
options O
what O
are O
you O
more O
comfortable O
with O
? O

go O
in O
not O
go O
in O
or O
go O
in O
with O
greater O
strength O
. O

ah O
as O
a O
solider O
it O
was O
not O
up O
to O
me O
whether O
or O
not O
we O
went O
in O
. O

but O
it O
is O
now O
you O
're O
a O
citizen O
. O

what O
should O
we O
have O
done O
? O

i O
went O
in O
. O

i O
w- O
- O

right O
. O

i O
think O
when O
we O
went O
in O
there O
and O
when O
we O
committed O
to O
doing O
it O
we O
should O
have O
done O
it O
the O
right O
way O
. O

and O
colin B-PERSON
powell I-PERSON
called O
for O
overwhelming O
force O
. O

general O
shinseki B-PERSON
said O
we O
needed O
several B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
of O
troops O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

and O
what O
we O
really O
need O
from O
the O
*journalistic O
journalistic O
community O
and O
the O
administration O
is O
honest O
candor O
about O
where O
are O
we O
now O
and O
how O
long O
are O
we O
going O
to O
be O
there O
? O

and O
i O
think O
when O
ms. O
morgan B-PERSON
she O
goes O
over O
there O
and O
cheerleads O
and O
really O
does O
n't O
provide O
an O
accurate O
analysis O
of O
the O
long O
term O
obstacles O
that O
we O
're O
up O
against O
it O
's O
disingenuous O
. O

okay O
if O
you O
're O
president O
last O
question O
paul B-PERSON
should O
we O
send O
more O
troops O
over O
there O
or O
bring O
them O
all O
back O
? O

what O
should O
we O
do O
? O

it O
it O
depends O
on O
what O
you O
want O
to O
achieve O
. O

well O
what O
do O
you O
want O
to O
achieve O
? O

but O
i O
think O
-- O
i O
think O
if O
we O
want O
to O
lock O
down O
a O
security O
situation O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
more O
troops O
. O

more O
troops O
. O

and O
i O
think O
that O
's O
a O
political O
- O

that O
is O
the O
conservative O
argument O
. O

and O
we O
hear O
that O
from O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
bill B-PERSON
kristol I-PERSON
john B-PERSON
mccain I-PERSON
. O

yeah O
. O

and O
that O
's O
a O
- O

a O
lot O
of O
people O
think O
uh O
jon B-PERSON
kyl I-PERSON
more O
troops O
. O

we O
'll O
be O
right O
back O
with O

you O

melanie B-PERSON
how O
do O
we O
get O
the O
straight O
scoop O
on O
what O
's O
happening O
in O
iraq B-GPE
because O
people O
tell O
me O
there O
's O
only O
two B-CARDINAL
ways O
to O
go O
over O
there O
as O
a O
journalist O
i O
think O
your O
experience O
confirms O
this O
you O
either O
go O
over O
there O
and O
stay O
in O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
or O
that O
that O
part O
of O
uh O
uh O
which O
is O
very O
secure O
and O
it O
's O
basically O
a O
compound O
or O
you O
go O
out O
with O
a O
unit O
as O
an O
embedded O
-- O
uh O
basically O
part O
of O
the O
unit O
an O
embedded O
reporter O
. O

you O
never O
really O
get O
to O
mix O
with O
the O
locals O
. O

uh O
how O
do O
you O
do O
it O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
they O
're O
-- O
we O
're O
actually O
winning O
the O
uh O
war O
over O
there O
. O

well O
that O
's O
exactly O
what O
i O
did O
. O

i O
went O
out O
um O
and O
visited O
with O
the O
troops O
. O

and O
i O
went O
outside O
of O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
unlike O
uh O
mr. O
rieckhoff B-PERSON
has O
accused O
me O
of O
doing O
. O

but O
do O
you O
-- O
outside O
that O
how O
do O
you O
get O
out O
there O
with O
the O
people O
? O

well O
because O
you O
get O
out O
there O
with O
the O
troops O
. O

they O
take O
you O
in O
in O
humvees B-PRODUCT
and O
in O
up- O
armored O
- O

then O
you O
get O
out O
of O
the O
humvees B-PRODUCT
. O

and O
and O
you O
hand O
out O
soccer O
balls O
. O

and O
you O
go O
to O
orphanages O
. O

and O
and O
you O
talk O
uh O
and O
hold O
hold O
babies O
and O
talk O
with O
the O
people O
who O
are O
taking O
care O
of O
them O
. O

all O
of O
these O
things O
that O
fourteen B-CARDINAL
members O
of O
our O
entourage O
did O
- O

but O
do O
speak O
of O
do O
people O
speak O
freely O
-- O
do O
people O
speak O
freely O
when O
there O
is O
a O

because O
let O
me O
- O

chris B-PERSON
chris B-PERSON
- O

no O
. O

chris B-PERSON
uh O
let O
me O
just O
say O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
. O

before O
mr. O
m- O
m- O
-- O
mr. O
rieckhoff B-PERSON
has O
written O
um O
that O
our O
group O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
bigots O
idiots O
and O
propagandists O
. O

and O
that O
's O
before O
he O
even O
cracked O
a O
sweat O
. O

now O
i O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
there O
is O
something O
very O
important O
a O
message O
that O
is O
very O
important O
that O
i O
wanted O
to O
articulate O
here O
. O

our O
men O
and O
women O
are O
living O
and O
dying O
in O
ghastly O
conditions O
. O

uh O
it O
's O
hot O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
and I-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
degrees I-QUANTITY
. O

they O
are O
making O
peace O
in O
in O
in O
sandstorms O
. O

they O
are O
doing O
their O
dead O
level O
best O
to O
make O
this O
policy O
that O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
has O
put O
forth O
work O
. O

i O
think O
that O
as O
an O
american B-NORP
people O
the O
stories O
that O
i O
tell O
from O
iraq B-GPE
and O
that O
our O
fellow O
talk O
show O
hosts O
told O
um O
eh O
uh O
hopefully O
will O
engender O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
patience O
and O
endurance O
by O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
. O

i O
think O
we O
owe O
our O
troops O
that O
. O

let O
me O
ask O
you O
the O
same O
question O
paul B-PERSON
. O

how O
do O
you O
get O
the O
the O
true O
scoop O
over O
there O
if O
you O
're O
always O
with O
the O
american B-NORP
troops O
? O

i O
mean O
do O
you O
ever O
get O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
? O

maybe O
it O
's O
just O
a O
catch O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
. O

they O
're O
too O
dangerous O
to O
deal O
with O
. O

but O
how O
do O
you O
get O
the O
story O
? O

the O
the O
reality O
is O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

and O
i O
think O
ms. O
morgan B-PERSON
is O
really O
insulting O
all O
the O
troops O
who O
've O
been O
there O
to O
assume O
that O
by O
going O
for O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
and O
taking O
a O
few O
casual O
leisurely O
trips O
outside O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
that O
she O
got O
a O
full O
taste O
of O
combat O
. O

i O
think O
the O
reality O
is O
much O
different O
. O

and O
if O
reporters O
really O
want O
to O
do O
some O
investigative O
reporting O
they O
can O
fly O
into O
jordan B-GPE
and O
go O
unembedded O
. O

now O
there O
is O
a O
chance O
they O
might O
get O
their O
head O
cut O
off O
. O

but O
that O
's O
the O
reality O
that O
we O
face O
as O
soldiers O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

i O
think O
really O
the O
best O
way O
to O
do O
it O
is O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
troops O
coming O
home O
. O

we O
're O
ready O
. O

we O
're O
-- O
we O
're O
willing O
and O
able O
to O
come O
on O
your O
program O
and O
others O
and O
talk O
about O
our O
experiences O
and O
really O
try O
to O
educate O
the O
public O
about O
the O
reality O
of O
all O
sides O
of O
this O
conflict O
. O

well O
guess O
what O
. O

that O
's O
exactly O
what O
we O
did O
. O

we O
stuck O
a O
microphone O
in O
front O
of O
all O
of O
the O
troops O
. O

ma'am O
you O
did O
it O
with O
-- O
you O
did O
- O

we O
stuck O
a O
microphone O
and O
let O
them O
-- O
let O
them O
talk O
directly O
to O
the O
people O
of O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
. O

you O
did O
it O
while O
they O
were O
on O
active O
duty O
. O

ma'am O
you O
did O
while O
they O
were O
on O
active O
duty O
. O

unfiltered O
by O
the O
main O
stream O
media O
that O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
guts O
- O

are O
you O
going O
to O
yell O
over O
me O
the O
entire O
show O
? O

i O
'm O
-- O
i O
'm O
trying O
to O
respond O
to O
- O

okay O
her O
turn O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

melanie B-PERSON
your O
turn O
. O

take O
a O
minute O
melanie B-PERSON
. O

melanie B-PERSON
make O
your O

. O

i O
'm O
sorry O
. O

no O
interruptions O
please O
paul B-PERSON
. O

give O
her O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
. O

what O
i O
want O
to O
say O
is O
that O
we O
took O
our O
microphones O
to O
the O
us B-GPE
troops O
. O

and O
if O
you O
think O
that O
what O
we O
heard O
from O
them O
are O
lies O
then O
you O
are O
accusing O
the O
troops O
of O
being O
liars O
because O
we O
did O
not O
filter O
or O
editorialize O
or O
in O
any O
way O
try O
to O
massage O
their O
message O
. O

they O
gave O
us O
the O
story O
as O
they O
see O
it O
. O

and O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
believe O
it O
then O
you O
are O
doing O
a O
disservice O
to O
your O
fellow O
troops O
. O

ma'am O
uh O
uh O
go O
ahead O
. O

oh O
let O
me O
go O
paul B-PERSON
before O
you O
start O
. O

what O
i O
keep O
doing O
here O
is O
asking O
people O
on O
and O
off O
camera O
who O
come O
on O
this O
program O
high O
- O
ranking O
officers O
enlisted O
uh O
former O
officers O
. O

uh O
i O
get O
sometimes O
not O
all O
the O
time O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
versions O
the O
version O
they O
give O
me O
on O
the O
air O
and O
the O
version O
they O
give O
me O
the B-TIME
minute I-TIME
when O
we O
're O
off O
the O
air O
. O

the O
version O
they O
give O
me O
when O
we O
're O
on O
the O
air O
is O
gung O
ho O
we O
're O
doing O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
everything O
is O
moving O
along O
. O

the O
version O
they O
give O
me O
off O
the O
air O
is O
rumsfeld B-PERSON
is O
crazy O
there O
are O
n't O
enough O
troops O
over O
there O
we O
're O
not O
taking O
this O
seriously O
enough O
or O
we O
should O
n't O
be O
there O
sometimes O
. O

it O
is O
n't O
always O
a O
straight O
scoop O
- O

. O

when O
you O
go O
on O
televsion O
with O
people O
because O
they O
want O
to O
be O
loyal O
to O
their O
units O
and O
their O
their O
service O
. O

that O
's O
exactly O
right O
. O

and O
chris B-PERSON
i O
'm O
no O
-- O
i O
'm O
-- O
there O
's O
no O
one O
more O
loyal O
to O
the O
troops O
than O
i O
am O
. O

i O
am O
still O
in O
the O
reserves O
. O

there O
's O
a O
likelihood O
that O
i O
'll O
go O
back O
while O
ms. O
morgan B-PERSON
is O
back O
at O
her O
radio O
show O
. O

so O
what O
i O
really O
want O
to O
do O
is O
educate O
the O
public O
about O
the O
truth O
of O
what O
's O
happening O
there O
. O

and O
i O
think O
the O
reality O
is O
that O
when O
people O
like O
her O
go O
over O
there O
there O
's O
a O
public O
affairs O
officer O
standing O
right O
next O
to O
that O
young O
soldier O
. O

and O
he O
's O
on O
active O

. O

and O
he O
wants O
to O
support O
the O
cause O
. O

and O
he O
ca O
n't O
speak O
freely O
. O

that O
's O
a O
fact O
. O

a O
young O

how O
many O

? O

yes O

well O
, O
we O
know O
that O
-- O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
-- O


um O
, O
well O
, O
initially O
how O
did O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
it O
would O
be O
really O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
deposition O
. O

er O
, O
when O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
the O
victim O
, O
she O
did O
not O
want O
-- O
avoided O
us O
-- O
did O
not O
want O
to O
meet O
with O
us O
. O

she O
hid O
after O
you O
made O
the O
inquiry O
. O

even O
if O
after O
you O
found O
her O
, O
she O
also O
-- O
once O
asked O
questions O
-- O
this O
thing O
did O
n't O
happen O
to O
me O
. O

mainly O
out O
of O
fear O
, O
fear O
of O
retaliation O
, O
right O
. O

yes O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

-- O

he O
was O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
, O
afraid O
of O
retaliation O
, O
and O
moreover O
, O
he O
was O
not O
sure O
whether O
this O
time O
you O
the O
police O
agency O
could O
execute O
a O
thorough O
crackdown O
. O

right O
. O

he O
could O
n't O
perceive O
your O
resolution O
and O
your O
capabilities O
. O

uh-huh O
, O
how O
could O
you O
make O
a O
breakthrough O
. O

we O
did O
two B-QUANTITY
things O
to O
make O
a O
breakthrough O
in O
getting O
the O
deposition O
. O

first B-ORDINAL
, O
we O
publicized O
to O
the O
masses O
our O
determination O
this O
time O
to O
fight O
against O
evil O
. O

another O
thing O
was O
to O
publicize O
through O
scrolling O
media O
headlines O
. O

well O
, O
their O
municipal O
bureau O
did O
some O
, O
did O
several O
runs O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
propaganda O
advertising O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
propaganda O
report O
on O
, O
um O
, O
tv O
, O
for O
example O
, O
saying O
that O
fighting O
evil O
has O
no O
timetable O
, O

so O
, O
the O
public O
was O
very O
afraid O
that O
you O
would O
fight O
for O
a O
while O
and O
then O
you O
would O
stop O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

was O
n't O
the O
investigation O
done O
in O
secret O
. O

how O
could O
there O
be O
propaganda O
advertisements O
. O

well O
, O
on O
december B-DATE
11 I-DATE
, O
i O
said O
, O
that O
is O
, O
four B-QUANTITY
criminal O
suspects O
who O
participated O
in O
special O
case O
1009 O
also O
turned O
themselves O
in O
, O
in O
huainan B-GPE
city I-GPE
, O
another O
of O
our O
cities O
. O

so O
, O
by O
interrogating O
them O
, O
the O
details O
of O
the O
case O
became O
clear O
as O
well O
. O

well O
, O
subsequently O
we O
thought O
that O
based O
on O
the O
information O
we O
previously O
obtained O
; O
it O
was O
time O
to O
go O
public O
. O

uh-huh O
. O


the O
limits O
to O
legal O
absurdity O
stretched O
another O
notch O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
when O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
refused O
to O
hear O
an O
appeal O
from O
a O
case O
that O
says O
corporate O
defendants O
must O
pay O
damages O
even O
after O
proving O
that O
they O
could O
not O
possibly O
have O
caused O
the O
harm O
. O

we O
can O
understand O
and O
share O
the O
compassion O
that O
makes O
judges O
sometimes O
wish O
to O
offer O
a O
kind O
of O
solomonic B-PERSON
aid O
to O
those O
who O
've O
been O
hurt O
. O

but O
this O
case O
is O
a O
stark O
lesson O
in O
how O
the O
failures O
of O
the O
traditional O
policy O
- O
making O
process O
have O
left O
the O
courts O
as O
the O
only O
forum O
this O
country O
has O
to O
debate O
risk O
, O
technology O
and O
innovation O
. O

too O
often O
now O
, O
a O
single B-CARDINAL
court O
decision O
becomes O
the O
precedent O
for O
other O
, O
less O
compelling O
cases O
. O

from B-DATE
the I-DATE
1940s I-DATE
until I-DATE
1971 I-DATE
, O
some B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
women O
took O
the O
synthetic O
hormone O
diethylstilbestrol O
-lrb- O
des O
-rrb- O
to O
prevent O
miscarriages O
and O
morning O
sickness O
. O

the O
drug O
was O
approved O
by O
the B-ORG
food I-ORG
and I-ORG
drug I-ORG
administration I-ORG
and O
marketed O
by O
some B-CARDINAL
300 I-CARDINAL
pharmaceutical O
companies O
, O
often O
under O
generic O
labels O
. O

in O
the B-DATE
1970s I-DATE
, O
scientists O
reported O
cancer O
cases O
among O
the O
daughters O
of O
des O
users O
. O

the O
cases O
quickly O
went O
to O
court O
, O
but O
the O
mothers O
of O
several B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
des O
plaintiffs O
could O
n't O
recall O
whose O
brand O
they O
used O
. O

beginning O
in O
1980 B-DATE
, O
courts O
in O
several O
states O
including O
california B-GPE
and O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
decided O
to O
suspend O
the O
common O
- O
law O
rule O
that O
plaintiffs O
must O
prove O
that O
the O
defendants O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
are O
liable O
. O

courts O
made O
the O
assumption O
that O
all O
des O
pills O
were O
essentially O
the O
same O
, O
and O
created O
a O
market O
- O
share O
test O
so O
that O
damages O
would O
be O
assessed O
against O
drug O
makers O
in O
the O
proportion O
of O
their O
share O
of O
the O
original O
sales O
. O

this O
has O
some O
logic O
. O

drug O
makers O
should O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
duck O
liability O
because O
people O
could O
n't O
identify O
precisely O
which O
identical O
drug O
was O
used O
. O

but O
courts O
quickly O
tumbled O
down O
a O
slippery O
slope O
. O

just O
as O
all O
plaintiffs O
are O
not O
alike O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
des O
defendants O
marketed O
the O
drugs O
differently O
and O
may O
have O
offered O
different O
warranties O
. O

the O
ultimate O
result O
came O
in O
hymowitz B-PERSON
v. O
lilly B-ORG
, O
where O
the O
highest O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
court O
expanded O
the O
market O
- O
share O
approach O
for O
the O
first O
time O
to O
say O
that O
drug O
makers O
that O
could O
prove O
mindy B-PERSON

mother O
did O
n't O
use O
their O

must O
still O
pay O
their O

damages O
. O

but O
as O
duke B-ORG
university I-ORG
law O
professor O
william B-PERSON
van I-PERSON
alstyne I-PERSON
notes O
, O
by O
this O
reasoning O
a O
defendant O
could O
be O
held O
liable O
in O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
for O
a O
bad O
apple O
even O
if O
he O
sold O
all O
his O
apples O
in O
california B-GPE
. O

despite O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
's I-ORG
refusal O
to O
hear O
the O
case O
, O
there O
are O
serious O
constitutional O
issues O
of O
due O
process O
and O
uncompensated O
takings O
from O
the O
defendants O
. O

the O
big O
problem O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
there O
's O
no O
guarantee O
that O
this O
reasoning O
will O
be O
limited O
to O
des O
or O
to O
drugs O
. O

the O
problem O
here O
goes O
well O
beyond O
twisting O
legal O
doctrine O
. O

the B-ORG
california I-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
reversed O
direction O
to O
make O
it O
much O
harder O
to O
win O
des O
cases O
because O
the O
justices O
saw O
how O
all O
the O
pharmaceutical O
litigation O
has O
chilled O
the O
introduction O
of O
new O
drugs O
. O

the O
court O
rejected O
strict O
liability O
for O
prescription O
drugs O
, O
citing O
the O
huge O
, O
hidden O
social O
costs O
. O

`` O
public O
policy O
favors O
the O
development O

marketing O
of O

, O
even O
though O
some O
risks O
, O
perhaps O
serious O
ones O
, O
might O
accompany O
their O
introduction O
because O
drugs O
can O
save O
lives O
and O
reduce O
pain O
and O
suffering O
, O
'' O
the O
unanimous O
court O
said O
. O

the O
california B-GPE

noted O
that O
the O
fear O
of O

already O
forced O

, O
bendectin B-PRODUCT
, O
off O
the O

this O
raises O
the O
key O
issue O
: O
what O
to O
do O
about O
people O
who O
suffer O
serious O
injuries O
from O
beneficial O
drugs O
? O

we O
now O
know O
that O
holding O
drug O
makers O
liable O
where O
there O
's O
no O
evidence O
that O
they O
or O
anyone O
else O
knew O
of O
any O
risks O
only O
means O
the O
drugs O
wo O
n't O
be O
available O
to O
anyone O
. O

as O
liability O
expert O
peter B-PERSON
huber I-PERSON
tells O
us O
, O
after O
the O
hymowitz B-PERSON
case O
, O
if O
any O
drug O
maker O
introduces O
an O
anti-miscarriage O
drug O
`` O
it O
's O
time O
to O
sell O
that O
company O
's O
stock O
short O
. O
'' O

we O
also O
know O
that O
the O
tort O
system O
is O
a O
lousy O
way O
to O
compensate O
victims O
anyway O
; O
some O
win O
the O
legal O
lottery O
, O
others O
get O
much O
less O
and O
contingency O

lawyers O
take O
a O
big O
cut O
either O
way O
. O

des O
daughters O

other O
victims O
of O

would O
be O
better O
off O
if O
their O
cases O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
the O

. O

congress B-ORG
could O
create O

program O
to O
help O
such O
victims O
while O
protecting O
the O
national O
interest O
in O
encouraging O
new O

. O

but O
a O
1986 B-DATE
law O
that O
supposedly O
replaced O
lawsuits O
over O
children O

vaccines O
with O
a O
compensation O
fund O
has O
predictably O
led O
to O
even O
more O

everyone O

so O
when O

in O
the O

, O
uh O
, O
the O

uh O

north B-GPE

well O

now O
north B-GPE

, O
it O
has O
also O

, O
like O
this O
, O
as O
a O
nuclear O
country O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
participate O
in O
the O

in O
this O

. O

of O

, O
several O
other O

, O
especially O
the O
us B-GPE
, O
are O
strongly O

, O
and O
will O
absolutely O
not O

yet O
, O
here O
, O
we O
should O
see O
that O
there O
is O
still O
a O
certain O
level O
of O
flexibility O
at O

here O
. O

however O
, O
the O
overall O
atmosphere O
still O
does O
n't O
give O
people O
much O
to O
be O
optimistic O
about O
. O

well O
, O
the O
overall O
atmosphere O
, O
eh O
, O
under O
this O
, O
eh O
, O
just O
as O
we O
talked O
about O
before O
, O
the O
financial O

can O
be O

in O

. O

then O
again O
, O
the O
us B-GPE
also O

ah O
, O
this B-DATE

, O
actually O

now O
there O

been O
an O
awful O
lot O
of O
monday B-TIME
night I-TIME
quarterback O
quarterbacking O
taking O

that O

what O

you O
suppose O

i O

many O

watched O
christy B-PERSON

the O

that O
she O
took O
the O

in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

or O
did O
n't O
leave O
earlier O
. O

she O
was O
quite O
a O
misfit O
for O
this O

, O
and O
she O
showed O
that O
over O
and O
over O

she O
was O
not O
good O
at O
all O
at O
communicating O
the O
administration O
's O
message O
to O
the O
public O
and O
certainly O
to O
the O
environmental O
groups O
and O
she O
was O
even O
worse O
at O
bringing O
the O
epa B-ORG
bureaucracy O
, O
the O
epa B-ORG
environmental O
policy O
makers O
' O
message O
to O
this O
administration O
because O
she O
saw O
herself O
undercut O
over O
and O
over O
. O

that O
's O
interesting O
because O
leading O
into O
it O
, O
while O
she O
was O
new B-GPE
jersey I-GPE
governor O
, O
she O
sued O
the O
epa B-ORG
and O
she O
was O
very O
much O
considering O
herself O
to O
be O
an O
environmentalist O
, O
and O
then O
only O
to O
end O
up O
becoming O
the O
head O
of O
the O
epa B-ORG
and O
then O
of O
course O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
criticism O
over O

. O

let O

hear O
what O
she O
had O
to O
say O
last B-DATE
wednesday I-DATE
here O
on O

just O
after O

i O
'm O
not O

i O

we O
have O
have O
been O
on O

i O
was O

i O

for O

out O

i O
'm O
sure O
that O
it O
was O
difficult O
for O

i O
think O
the O

perhaps O
would O

less O

if O

the O

is O
what O
the O
sheikh B-PERSON
said O
as O
quoted O
from O
his O
website O
islam B-WORK_OF_ART
today I-WORK_OF_ART
: O
-- O

then O
his B-PERSON
excellency I-PERSON
was O
asked O
about O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
former O
iraqi B-NORP
president O
, O
saddam B-PERSON
hussein I-PERSON

he O
responded O
that O
" O
he O
was O
greatly O
sympathized O
with O
by O
the O
arabs B-NORP
and O
moslems B-NORP
as O
his O
execution O
came O
at O
an O
outstanding O
time O
. O

if O
it O
had O
been O
asked O
to O
chosen O
a O
time O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
found O
a O
better O
and O
more O
outstanding O
one O
than O
this O
one O
. O

and O
he O
said O
that O
he O
was O
a B-NORP
sunni I-NORP
moslem I-NORP
from O
the O
community O
of O
moslems B-NORP
and O
that O
he O
prounounced O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
testimony I-WORK_OF_ART
of I-WORK_OF_ART
truth I-WORK_OF_ART
at O
the O
last O
moment O
of O
his O
life O
. O

so O
may O
god O
have O
mercy O
on O
him O
and O
may O
god O
's O
forgive O
us O
and O
him O
. O

as O
it O
is O
said O
in O
the O
hadith B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
whose O
last O
words O
in O
this O
world O
were O
' O
there O
is O
no O
god O
but O
god O
' O
will O
enter O
paradise O
. O

he O
also O
quoted O
the O
hadith O
of O
ibn B-PERSON
masud I-PERSON
in O
sahih B-WORK_OF_ART
al I-WORK_OF_ART
- I-WORK_OF_ART
bukhari I-WORK_OF_ART
: O
" O
a O
man O
amongst O
you O
may O
do O
evil O
deeds O
till O
there O
is O
only O
a O
cubit O
between O
him O
and O
the O
hell O
fire O
, O
and O
then O
what O
has O
been O
written O
for O
him O
decides O
his O
behavior O
, O
and O
he O
starts O
doing O
deeds O
characteristic O
of O
the O
people O
of O
paradise O
. O
" O
. O

then O
he O
added O
that O
saddam B-PERSON
was O
not O
tried O
by O
a O
legal O
or O
sharia B-LAW
court O
but O
by O

saddam B-PERSON

was O
the O
only O
leader O
in O
the O
modern O
history O
of O
this O
nation O
who O
went O
to O
the O
guillotine O
because O

was O
a O
patriot O
who O
refused O

surrender O

the O

chose O
resistance O

the O
only O
ones O

kept O
it O
for O
them O

the O
records O

they O
hastily O
executed O
him O
because O
they O
feared O
him O
even O
when O
he O
was O
behind O
bars O
, O
just O
as O
they O
will O
still O
fear O
him O
as O
a O
corpse O
hidden O
under O
the O

, O
and O
comparisons O
between O
his O

their O
bloody O

chaotic O
time O
always O
came O
in O
his O
favor O

and O
the O
calls O

his O
return O

save O
iraq B-GPE
from O
its O
crisis O
and O
the O
corrupt O

malicious O
gang O
that O
governs O
it O
have O
become O
deafening O
to O
the O
ears O

the O

he O
embarrassed O
them O
and O
dwarfed O
them O
by O
standing O
as O
a O
spear O
in O
the O
prisoner O

dock O
. O

they O
were O
terrified O
by O
the O
penetrating O
looks O
of O
his O
eyes O
. O

they O
were O
exposed O
by O
his O
patriotism O

arabism B-NORP
and O
his O
contempt O
for O
the O
odious O
sectarian O
divisions O
that O
they O
planted O
in O
their O
contaminated O
new O
iraq B-GPE

so O
they O
decided O

get O

him O
with O
a O
confused O

embarrassing O
hastiness O
. O

thanks O

the O

this O

exposed O
the O

he O
was O

when O

said O
, O
" O

with O

when O
the O

is O
it O
manliness O
to O
shout O
hateful O

in O

of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
never O
been O

the O

his O
soul O
will O
go O

in O
a O

are O

are O
these O
the O
values O
of O

are O
those O
the O
sons O
of O
the O
great O
iraq B-GPE
which O
had O
always O
stood O
up O
against O
invaders O
throughout O

was O
a O
pillar O

support O

its O
nation O
and O
the O
causes O
of O
justice O
in O
the O
world O
as O
a O
whole O
? O

we O
are O
sorry O
, O
but O
not O
surprised O
, O
because O
some O
arab B-NORP
governments O
objected O
only O
because O
the O
execution O
took O
place O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
feast I-DATE
of I-DATE
bairam I-DATE
, O
as O
if O
the O
execution O
of O
this O
man O
would O
have O
been O
permissible O
and O
blessed O
on O
any B-DATE
other I-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

we O
are O
sorry O
again O
because O
most O
of O
the O
arab B-NORP
leaders O
hid O
in O
their O
palaces O
and O
none O
of O
them O
dared O
to O
speak O
even O
one B-CARDINAL
word O
of O
protest O
out O
of O
fear O
of O
america B-GPE
. O

we O
were O
stabbed O
twice O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
when O
we O
watched O
an O
arab B-NORP
leader O
being O
led O
to O
the O
gallows O
in O
accordance O
with O
sectarian O
justice O
which O
is O
spiteful O
and O
vengeful O
. O
and O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
time O
when O
we O
did O
not O
see O
anyone O
among O
the O
club O
of O
leaders O
to O
which O
he O
belonged O
for O
more O
than O
30 B-CARDINAL
years O
object O
to O
his O
execution O
. O

maybe O
god O
wanted O
a O
good O
end O
for O
him O
, O
and O
a O
good O
reputation O
, O
when O
he O
induced O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
to O
record O
what O
america B-GPE
and O
the O
government O
of O
sects O
wanted O
to O
hide O
, O
by O
means O
of O
the O
video O
of O
the O
last B-ORDINAL
moments O
, O
which O
created O
a O
historic O
turning O
point O
that O
will O
perhaps O
shape O
the O
history O
of O
the O
region O
, O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
events O
in O
it O
for O
decades B-DATE
to I-DATE
come I-DATE
. O

maybe O
god O
wanted O
to O
expose O
the O
series O
of O
lies O
of O
muwaffaq B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
rabi I-PERSON
the O
national O

-lrb- O
where O
is O
that O
security O

-rrb- O
, O
who O
went O
out O
to O
the O
world O
saying O
that O
he O
, O
meaning O
president O
saddam B-PERSON
, O
was O
weak O
and O
collapsing O
while O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
meet O
his O
god O

then O
the O
tape O
comes O
along O
and O
shows O
us O
with O
sound O
and O
image O
that O
we O
are O
in O
front O
of O
a O
courageous O
lion O
, O
who O
refuses O
to O
wear O
the O
mask O
, O
just O
as O
he O
refused O
to O
take O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
they O
offered O
him O
. O

why O
the O
mask O
, O
and O
why O
the O
pills O
? O

the O
mask O
is O
for O
traitors O
and O
criminals O
who O
are O
ashamed O
of O
their O
treason O
or O
their O
crimes O
, O
and O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
are O
appropriate O
for O
those O
who O
can O
not O
face O
history O
because O
of O
their O
bad O
deeds O
. O

the O
american B-NORP
administration O
committed O
a O
fatal O
mistake O
and O
revealed O
a O
major O
foolishness O
to O
be O
added O
to O
its O
many O
foolishnesses O
in O
iraq B-GPE
when O
it O
executed O
this O
man O
, O
in O
a O
way O
for O
which O
it O
will O
pay O
a O
hefty O
price O
in O
the B-DATE
near I-DATE
future I-DATE
. O

his O
survival O
would O
have O
benefited O
it O
much O
more O
than O
his O
execution O
if O
they O
understood O
politics O
as O
they O
should O
, O
because O
his O
survival O
could O
have O
been O
a O
card O
to O
threaten O
the O
sectarians O
and O
keep O
them O
as O
servants O
to O
them O
and O
their O
schemes O
, O
just O
as O
it O
could O
have O
been O
a O
bargaining O
chip O
for O
calming O
down O
the O
resistance O
and O
the O
broad O
iraqi B-NORP
sector O
which O
supports O
it O
. O

but O
they O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
except O
grudges O
, O
and O
they O
do O
not O
want O
anything O
other O
than O
inflicting O
more O
degradation O
on O
the O
arabs B-NORP
and O
muslims B-NORP
by O
his O
execution O
. O

perhaps O
the O
american B-NORP
administration O
will O
have O
succeeded O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
only O
, O
intentionally O
and O
with O
planning O
or O
without O
it O
, O
namely O
, O
deepening O
the O
sectarian O
breach O
not O
only O
in O
iraq B-GPE

in O
the O
islamic B-NORP

that O
if O

perhaps O
there O
would O

but O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
lebanese B-NORP
crisis O
at O
this O

defies O

the O

instead O
, O
the O

and O
since O

the O

in O
my O
estimation O
, O
the O
situation O

the O

consequently O
, O
lebanon B-GPE
in O
this O

does O
not O
, O
you O

represent O
an O

i O
'm O
coming O
to O
detroit B-GPE

so O
it O
's O
been O
really O
good O
since O
i O
've O

i O
mean O
actually O
i O
made O
the O
decision O

and O
i O
thought O
oh O
god O
what O
am O
i O
doing O
you O
know O

i O
'm O
i O
just O
was O
still O
unsure O
about O
it O

but O
within O
in O
a O
couple O
days O
i O
just O
felt O
really O
at O
peace O
with O
it O
and O
remained O
so O
throughout O
the O
time O
that O
i O
prepared O
to O
leave O

and O
then O
ever O
since O
i O
've O
been O
here O
i O
keep O
thinking O
okay O
why O
am O
i O
so O
okay O
with O
this O

i O
'm O
going O
to O
be O
falling O
apart O
any O
minute O
, O
right O
you O
know O
? O

because O
i O
'm O
really O
used O
to O
transition O
hitting O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
harder O
especially O
when O
i O
was O
so O
ambivalent O
about O
the O
decision O

but O
right O
. O
%um O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

it O
's O
been O
great O

that O
's O
great O
. O

so O

yeah O
. O

great O
. O

do O
n't O
question O
it O
? O

go O
with O
it O

yeah O

exac- O

that O
's O
what O
i O
said O
finally O
%um O

i O
was O
telling O
somebody O

somebody O
is O
like O
well O
how O
you O
doing O
? O

i O
said O
well O

i O
'm O
fine O
you O
know O

i O
keep O
wondering O
how O
long O
that O
's O
going O
to O
last O
. O

i O
'm O
fine O

what O
's O
wrong O
with O
me O

and O
then O
finally O
i O
'm O
like O
you O
know O
i O
am O
just O
going O
to O
be O
okay O
that O
i O
'm O
okay O

and O
if O
i O
'm O
not O
okay O
later O
that O
's O
fine O

but O
right O
now O
i O
'm O
okay O

i O
have O
to O
stop O
wondering O

the O

that O

everyone O
needs O
to O
recognize O
that O
arlington B-GPE

decision O
not O

means O
that O

end O
up O

presumably O
in O

if O
arlington B-GPE
has O
sufficient O
public O

support O

at O
crystal B-LOC

, O
adding O

to O
that O
area O
would O
be O
an O
excellent O
idea O
. O

the O
question O
that O
the O
arlington B-GPE
community O
needs O
to O
answer O
is O
: O
whether O
the O
supporting O
infrastructure O
is O
sufficient O
? O

if O
not O
, O
what O
is O
the O
incentive O
for O
arlingtonians B-NORP
to O
dig O
deeper O
in O
their O
pockets O
to O
pay O
for O
public O
infrastructure O
so O
that O
the O

not O
get O
constructed O
in O

? O

the O

run O
one B-CARDINAL

just O

then O
around O

moreover O
, O
while O
i O
'm O
sure O
that O

enjoy O
the O
urban O
life O
of O
a O
newly O

crystal B-LOC

, O
many O

would O
not O

many O
people O
simply O
want O

in O
single O

detached O
homes O
that O
will O
not O
be O
available O
in O
crystal B-LOC

further O
, O
any O

built O
in O
that O

will O
likey O
be O
quite O
costly O

the O

the O

ray B-PERSON

something O

lots O

i O
do O

just O
the O

but O
, O
what O
would O

the O
benefit O

this O
? O

more O
specifically O
- O
what O
would O
be O
the O
benefit O
to O
those O
who O
already O
live O

pay O

-lrb- O
i O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
i O
would O
agree O
that O
more O

would O
be O
needed O
for O
residential O
vs O
commercial O
but O
let O
's O
explore O
it O
. O

it O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
that O
if O
you O
took O
an O
office O
building O
in O
crystal B-LOC
and O
converted O
it O
to O
apartments O
.. O
you O
'd O
not O
have O
any O

-lrb- O
perhaps O
less O
-rrb- O
so O
you O
would O
n't O
need O
any O
more O
water O
/ O
sewer O
capacity O
... O
and O
ditto O
for O

places O
... O
at O
least O
it O
would O
seem O
so O
-rrb- O
. O

ditto O
with O
commuting O
... O

instead O
of O
a O
hoard O
of O
folks O
`` O
in O
commuting O
'' O
from O
outer O
jurisdictions O
to O
arlington B-GPE
every O
morning O
, O
would O
n't O
you O
have O
instead O
- O
more O
`` O
out O
'' O
commuting O
. O

finally O
, O
the O
folks O
who O
actually O
own O
the O
land O
- O
would O
they O
agree O
to O
a O
change O
in O
the O
zoning O
from O
office O
commercial O
to O
apartment O
residential O
? O

what O
would O
be O
the O
economics O
of O
this O
with O
respect O
to O
those O
who O
hold O
those O
properties O
as O
investments O
? O

it O
would O
seem O
- O
that O
arlington B-GPE
and O
the O
other O
area O
jurisdictions O
have O
already O
had O
such O
a O
choice O
for O
years B-DATE
- O
and O
that O
they O
chose O
commercial O
development O
over O
residential O
- O
in O
effect O
- O
letting O
more O
remote O
jurisdictions O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
provide O
residential O
for O
folks O
who O
wanted O
to O
work O
in O
nova B-LOC
and O
commute O
to O
the O
outer O
suburbs O
to O
live O
. O

to O
a O
certain O
extent O
- O
one O
could O
say O
that O
no B-LOC
va I-LOC
jurisdictions O
have O
a O
responsibility O
to O
provide O
housing O
for O
those O
that O
work O
in O
the O
same O
area O
and O
not O
force O
workers O
to O
commute O
to O
outer O
jursidictions O
for O
housing O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
. O

in O
the O
end O
- O
every O
worker O
who O
, O
for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
ends O
up O
commuting O
... O
that O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
person O
using O
the O
transportation O
network O
more O
intensively O
than O
those O
that O
live O
locally O
with O
shorter O
commutes O
. O

so O
.. O
here O
's O
a O
concluding O
thought O
. O

what O
kind O
of O
an O
exercise O
would O
it O
be O
for O
each O
nova B-LOC
jurisdiction O
to O
total O
up O
the O
number O
of O
jobs O
in O
its O
boundaries O
verses O
the O
amount O
of O
housing O
within O
its O
boundaries O
. O

would O
we O
see O
a O
big O
disparity O
? O

i O
know O
where O
i O
live O
in O
the O
outer O
suburbs O
that O
there O
is O
a O
big O
disparity O
in O
the O
opposite O
sense O
. O

we O
have O
far O
, O
far O
more O
people O
in O
homes O
than O
we O
have O
jobs O
for O
them O
. O

in O
other O
words O
a O
huge O
percent O
of O
our O
population O
are O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
nova B-LOC
commuters O
. O

with O
respect O
to O
the O
jobs O
/ O

question O
- O
i O
wonder O
what O
the O
totals O
would O
be O
for O
the O
entire O
nova B-LOC
area O
- O
all O
jursidictions O
with O
respect O
to O

verses O

. O

from O
an O
equity O
perspective O
- O
should O
jurisdictions O
provide O
as O
much O
housing O
as O
they O
have O
jobs O
? O

the O
mechanism O
for O
doing O
this O
would O
be O
zoning O
- O

a O
certain O
percentage O
of O
areas O
would O
be O
reserved O
only O
for O
residential O
development O
or O
areas O
designated O
for O

use O
development O
would O
have O
a O
hard O
percentage O
cap O
on O
how O
much O

had O
to O
be O
part O
of O
the O
mixed O
- O
used O
proposal O
. O

or O
to O
turn O
this O
completely O
around O
- O
would O

support O
the O
right O
of O
any O
jurisdiction O
to O
zone O
entirely O
that O
jurisdiction O
for O
commercial O
/ O
industrial O
only O
and O
let O
outlying O
jurisdictions O
provide O
residential O
? O

in O
some O
respects O
, O
is O
n't O
that O
essentially O
what O
no B-LOC
va I-LOC
jursidictions O
are O
doing O
- O
favoring O
non-residential O
development O
and O
letting O
other O

handle O
the O

? O

turning O
this O
on O

what O

the O

larry B-PERSON
, O
this O
is O
my O
personal O
conviction O
: O

if O
local O
governments O
were O
not O
given O
the O
power O
to O
restrict O
housing O
development O
through O
zoning O
, O
a O
free O
market O
would O
provide O
a O
much O
better O
balance O
of O
housing O
/ O
jobs O
/ O
retail O
/ O
amenities O
than O
what O
we O
have O
now O
. O

the O
answer O
is O
less O
regulation O
, O
not O
more O
. O

jim B-PERSON
: O
i O
believe O
in O
free O
markets O
as O
well O
, O
but O
i O
also O
hold O
that O
free O
markets O
are O
equally O
as O
free O
of O
economic O
subsidies O
as O
well O
as O
over O
- O
burdensome O
regulation O
. O

what O
is O
the O
argument O
that O
letting O
people O
develop O
their O
property O
as O
desired O
without O
regard O
to O
the O
impact O
on O
existing O
residents O
and O
businesses O
is O
a O
free O
market O
? O

none O
of O
us O
would O
likely O
support O
the O
abolishment O
of O
all O
zoning O
as O
is O
basically O
the O
case O
in O
houston B-GPE
. O

would O
we O
find O
it O
acceptable O
to O
allow O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
foundary O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
residential O
neighborhood O
? O

what O
about O
building O
a O

story O
building O
in O
the O

? O

few O
of O
us O
would O
likely O
support O
that O
. O

we O
have O
a O
serious O
problem O
with O
public O
infrastructure O
in O
areas O
of O
virginia B-GPE
. O

few O
dispute O
that O
. O

what O
we O
argue O
over O
is O
who O
is O
responsible O
to O
fund O
the O
necessary O
infrastructure O
; O
to O
what O
amount O
; O
and O
should O
people O
be O
permitted O
to O
build O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
adequate O
public O
facilities O
. O

reasonable O
people O
can O
answer O
these O
questions O
differently O
. O

but O
, O
at O
some O
point O
, O
there O
is O
a O
question O
of O
basic O
equity O
that O
must O
be O
answered O
: O

how O
much O
`` O
cost O
'' O
should O
society O
be O
able O
to O
impose O
on O
an O
existing O
resident O
/ O
business O
so O
that O
someone O
else O
can O
use O
his O
or O
her O
property O
as O
they O
desire O
? O

since O
we O
would O
n't O
permit O
the O
foundary O
to O
built O
in O
the O
residential O
neighborhood O
, O
we O
all O
effectively O
agree O
that O
there O
are O
limits O
to O
how O
much O
cost O
we O
are O
willing O
to O
impose O
on O
existing O
residents O
. O

stated O
alternatively O
, O
one O
does O
not O
have O
an O
absolute O
right O
to O
use O
his O
/ O
her O
property O
as O
desired O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
question O
we O
might O
ask O
is O
: O
who O
is O
the O
cost O
- O
causer O
? O

the O
answer O
is O
always O
going O
to O
be O
`` O
the O
newcomer O
. O
'' O

one O
might O
also O
ask O
: O
at O
what O
point O
does O
it O
become O
unfair O
to O
load O
all O
of O
the O
costs O
on O
the O
newcomer O
? O

few O
would O
likely O
argue O
that O
, O
because O
of O
the O
high O
forward O
- O
looking O
costs O
for O
constructing O
infrastructure O
, O
we O
should O
not O
permit O
any O
building O
in O
virginia B-GPE
without O
the O
upfront O
payment O
of O
the O
total O
costs O
for O
constructing O
infrastructure O
. O

that O
would O
be O
unfair O
. O

but O
, O
at O
the O
very O
same O
time O
, O
is O
n't O
equally O
unfair O
to O
load O
all O
of O
the O
infrastructure O
costs O
on O
taxpayers O
-- O
especially O
given O
virginia B-GPE
's O
tax O
structure O
that O
takes O
much O
from O
nova B-LOC
and O
gives O
little O
back O
? O

one O
might O
be O
able O
to O
make O
a O
good O
argument O
that O
we O
could O
save O
transportation O
costs O
by O
building O
densely O
in O
nova B-LOC
. O

but O
what O
about O
the O
other O
infrastructure O
costs O
that O
are O
then O
imposed O
on O

yes O
, O
agree O
it O
was O
excellent O
in O
describing O
the O
issues O

but O
i O
'm O
perplexed O
... O
as O
usual O
... O

`` O
because O

'' O

i O
found O
this O
rather O
odd O
in O
that O
the O
concept O
of O
`` O
near O
'' O
is O
apparently O
perceived O
differently O
depending O
on O
whether O
you O
were O
an O
employer O
or O
an O
employee O
. O

employers O
want O
to O
be O
`` O
near O
'' O
a O
qualified O
workforce O
but O
employees O
-lrb- O
note O
they O
use O
the O
word O
residents O

continue O
to O

unless O
i O
'm O
not O
reading O
it O
properly O
... O
it O
sounds O
like O
the O
employers O
' O
concept O
of O
`` O
near O
'' O
is O
a O
very O
different O
concept O
than O
the O
employee O
's O
concept O
of O
a O
`` O
near O
'' O
place O
to O
live O
. O

would O
n't O
one O
presume O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
concepts O
be O
the O
same O
... O
that O
the O
employee O
would O
want O
to O
be O
near O
where O
a O
qualified O
workforce O
lives O
... O
and O
vice O

? O

also O
... O
discussed O
in O

was O
the O
idea O
that O
folks O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
move O
everytime O
they O
change O
jobs O
which O
is O
an O
excellent O
point O
but O
how O
does O
that O
explain O
folks O
who O
move O
to O
the O
outer O
burbs O
... O
and O
then O
change O
jobs O
that O
requires O
even O
a O
longer O
commute O
? O

are O
n't O
people O
who O
move O
to O
the O
outer O
burbs O
... O
for O
housing O
.. O
locking O
themselves O
in O
to O
a O
less O
flexible O
situation O
the O
same O
way O
that O
someone O
would O
in O
trying O
to O
live O
next O
door O
to O
where O
they O
work O
because O
in O
both O
cases O
.. O
if O
they O
change O
jobs O
- O
they O
've O
probably O
bought O
themselves O
a O
longer O
commute O
. O

is O
n't O
it O
curious O
the O
employers O
want O
to O
be O
near O
a O
qualified O
work O
force O
? O

would O
n't O
that O
result O
in O
less O
travel O
rather O
than O
more O
? O

the O
other O
comment O
of O
interest O
was O
that O
most O
residents O
of O
mixed O
use O
communities O
do O
n't O
find O
employment O
there O
. O

to O
the O
extent O
that O
some O
mixed O
use O
residents O
do O
find O
local O
employment O
that O
suits O
their O
skills O
, O
that O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
and O
it O
will O
marginally O
reduce O
travel O
. O

but O
we O
should O
not O
count O
on O
it O
as O
a O
panacea O
, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
conflict O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
we O
need O
more O
places O
. O

`` O
mixed O
use O
'' O
and O
`` O
more O
places O
'' O
are O
compatible O
ideas O
. O

the O
article O
should O
put O
to O
rest O
the O
argument O
that O
ed B-PERSON
risse I-PERSON
and O
i O
have O
had O
about O
job O
growth O
. O

his O
previous O
statement O
was O
that O
while O
the O
percet O
job O
growth O
in O
pw B-GPE
was O
high O
the O
absolute O
number O
was O
small O
. O

today O
we O
see O
that O
the O
absolute O
numbers O
are O
also O
higher O
. O

if O
we O
choose O
to O
have O
a O
successful O
transportation O
plan O
then O
we O
should O
design O
the O
plan O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
which O
will O
occur O
as O
a O
result O
of O
what O
is O
happening O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
what O
we O
wish O
would O
happen O
. O

otherwise O
you O
have O
to O
design O
not O
only O
a O
transportation O
plan O
but O
a O
way O
to O
change O
everyone O
's O
decisions O
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O

today O
's O
article O
shows O
how O
difficult O
that O
is O
, O
so O
why O
choose O
a O
plan O
that O
is O
bound O
to O
fail O
? O

metro B-FAC
will O
not O
ease O
congestion O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
done O
so O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
thirty I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

what O
it O
does O
do O
is O
allow O
more O
people O
to O
travel O
to O
some O
places O
than O
can O
be O
acommodated O
by O
highways O
. O

it O
does O
that O
by O
offering O
a O
lower O
level O
of O
service O
and O
less O
comfort O
-lrb- O
standing O
room O
only O
-rrb- O
. O

it O
might O
be O
that O
there O
is O
still O
sufficient O
reason O
to O
spend O
billions B-MONEY
of I-MONEY
scarce I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
on O
metro O
, O
but O
easing O
traffic O
congestion O
is O
n't O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O

we O
should O
evaluate O
the O
expenditure O
for O
what O
it O
does O
do O
and O
who O
benefits O
and O
assign O
the O
costs O
accordingly O
, O
if O
the O
expenditure O
is O
still O
reasonable O
. O

clearly O
, O
that O
does O
not O
include O
billing O
the O
tollroad O
users O
for O
metro B-FAC
construction O
. O

making O
route B-FAC
7 I-FAC
sixteen B-CARDINAL
lanes O
is O
probably O
just O
as O
bad O
an O
idea O
as O
metro B-FAC
. O

that O
is O
just O
another O
plan O
to O
take O
everyone O
to O
the O
same O
place O
, O
which O
we O
know O
will O
fail O
. O

the O
difference O
is O
that O
those O
who O
use O
that O
route O
will O
have O
individually O
controlled O
climate O
, O
music O
, O
and O
seats O
. O

and O
they O
can O
eat O
or O
smoke O
if O
they O
choose O
. O

aside O
from O
gerald B-PERSON
gordon I-PERSON

comments O

you O
have O

fully O
made O
the O

i O

say O

most O

have O
made O
the O

that O
the O
one O

wrong O

then O
, O

there O
is O
the O
apparently O
obligatory O

generally O
clueless O
comment O
by O

that O
such O

always O
seem O
to O

in O
this O

the O
completely O

obviously O
wrong O
statement O
that O
the O
conditions O
cited O
in O
the O
article O
leave O
everybody O
worse O
off O

if O
he O
wants O
to O
voice O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
wrong O
people O
are O
making O
money O
in O
the O
wrong O
places O
, O
that O
's O
different O
; O

but O
the O
claim O
that O
everybody O
is O
worse O
off O
is O
patently O
false O
and O
weakens O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
arguments O
accordingly O

when O

then O
they O

re O
: O
infrastructure O
costs O
and O
newcomers O

all O
things O
being O
equal O
.. O
a O
newcomer O
in O
nova B-LOC
needs O
infrastructure O
to O
support O
them O
in O
not O
very O
different O
ways O
that O
- O
that O
same O
newcomer O
in O
the O
outer O
burbs O
would O
need O
similar O
infrastructure O
- O

and O
it O
is O
the O
infrastructure O
costs O
that O
are O
much O
more O
at O
issue O
than O
density O
per O
se O
because O
discussions O
of O
density O
.. O
seem O
to O
always O
flow O
back O
to O
infrastructure O
and O
not O
focus O
on O
density O
itself O
as O
a O
good O
or O
bad O
thing O
. O

if O
a O
newcomer O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
money O
to O
have O
a O
garage O
on O
their O
new O
house O
- O
people O
would O
be O
up O
in O
arms O
if O
their O
property O
taxes O
were O
taken O
to O
pay O
for O
that O
new O
garage O

but O
apparently O
folks O
' O
views O
of O
this O
become O
less O
clear O
if O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
taking O
people O
's O
money O
to O
pay O
for O
.. O
say O
a O
new O
classroom O
.. O
or O
a O
new O
library O
or O
fire O
station O
or O
traffic O
light O
or O
widened O
roadways O
. O

i O
think O
property O
owners O
are O
willing O
for O
the O
most O
part O
to O
pay O
their O
fair O
share O
- O

but O
if O
the O
growth O
rate O
is O
high O
- O
where O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
influx O
of O
newcomers O
then O
we O
have O
significant O
money O
issues O
. O

for O
instance O
, O
our O
locality O
has O
to O
build O
a O
new O
school O
every O
year O
and O
i O
understand O
that O
loudoun B-GPE
has O
to O
build O
several O
new O
schools O
every O
year O
. O

schools O
are O
over O
70 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
our O
property O
taxes O
. O

without O
proffers O
- O
our O
taxes O
would O
have O
easily O
doubled O
and O
then O
some O
not O
to O
mention O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
the O
elected O
officials O
who O
approved O
those O
tax O
increases O
. O

everyone O
needs O
a O
place O
to O
live O

but O
i O
will O
point O
out O
that O
when O
a O
newcomer O
buys O
a O
home O
twice O
and O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
as O
big O
as O
the O
typical O
house O
in O
the O
outer O
burbs O
.. O
commutes O
solo O
in O
a O
-lrb- O
usually O
new O
-rrb- O
suv O
50 B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
a O
day O
and O
then O
expects O
folks O
of O
much O
more O
modest O
means O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
infrastructure O
tab O
.. O
that O
there O
will O
be O
complaints O
. O

`` O
another O
way O
of O
looking O
at O
this O
is O
that O
if O
new O
folks O
had O
to O
pay O
their O
actual O
share O
of O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
there O
would O
be O
less O
money O
for O
bigger O
homes O
and O
new O
suv O
and O
long O
solo O
commutes O
. O
'' O

and O
when O
we O
have O
all O
taxpayers O
picking O
up O
the O
tab O
for O
these O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
there O
is O
no O
incentive O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
new O
folks O
- O
to O
make O
conservative O
financial O
decisions O
- O

because O
, O
in O
essence O
, O
they O
are O
being O
subsididzed O
. O

the O
more O
that O
each O
person O
has O
to O
pay O
their O
own O
fair O
share O
of O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
the O
more O
it O
will O
impact O
the O
choices O
that O
have O
expensive O
consequences O

for O
either O
them O

for O

i O
pointed O
out O
in O
another O
post O
the O
problems O
of O
planned O
communities O
. O

there O
, O
the O
existing O
residents O
have O
not O
paid O
enough O
to O
support O
the O
common O
use O
land O
and O
common O
use O
infrastructure O
, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
these O
communities O
are O
now O
resorting O
to O
assessing O
additional O
fees O
, O
but O
only O
on O
newcomers O
. O

in O
this O
case O
the O
newcomers O
are O
not O
causing O
any O
new O
requirements O
, O

but O
they O
are O
still O
being O
expected O
to O
pay O
a O
higher O
price O
than O
existing O
residents O
, O
and O
for O
facilites O
that O
were O
worn O
out O
-lrb- O
by O
existing O
residents O
-rrb- O
before O
the O
new O
residents O
arrived O
. O

it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
this O
exposes O
a O
critical O
weakness O
in O
what O
we O
psychologically O
view O
as O
fair O
. O

i O
would O
agree O
with O
larry B-PERSON
if O
: O
a O
-rrb- O
existing O
residents O
were O
already O
paying O
enough O
to O
support O
existing O
infrastructure O
, O
which O
they O
are O
apparently O
not O
. O

-lrb- O
at O
least O
that O
is O
a O
widely O
held O
belief O
. O
-rrb- O

b O
-rrb- O
the O
additional O
costs O
-lrb- O
for O
proffers O
and O
such O
-rrb- O
over O
and O
above O
ordinary O
and O
sufficient O
property O
taxes O
were O
carefully O
examined O
to O
cover O
only O
the O
new O
and O
extraordinary O
capital O
costs O
associated O
solely O
with O
new O
residents O
. O

that O
means O
that O
you O
can O
not O
blame O
the O
new O
residents O
for O
increased O
capital O
costs O
that O
are O
really O
in O
support O
of O
new O
desires O
or O
needs O
on O
the O
part O
of O
all O
residents O
. O

say O
crime O
is O
up O
50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
so O
you O
need O
a O
new O
jail O
. O

at O
the O
same O
time O
new O
residents O
are O
planned O
to O
be O
up O
25 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

how O
much O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
new O
jail O
should O
the O
new O
residents O
pay O
? O

are O
you O
going O
to O
hold O
them O
responsible O
for O
the B-PERCENT
50 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
increased O
need O
that O
is O
due O
to O
existing O
residents O
? O

i O
understand O
larry B-PERSON
's O
point O
, O

but O
i O
think O
it O
is O
intellectually O
too O
easy O
to O
be O
correct O
. O

i O
particularly O
like O
this O
: O
another O
way O
of O
looking O
at O
this O
is O
that O
if O

less O

bigger O

and O
new O

and O

that O
is O
absolutely O
correct O
, O

and O
it O
corresponds O
to O
emr B-PERSON
's O
gloomy O
prediction O
that O
we O
will O
all O
face O
lowered O
expectations O
. O

but O
what O
if O
the O
choice O
is O
a O
smaller O
home O
in O
the O
exurbs O
and O
a O
hybrid O
? O

it O
is O
a O
fine O
argument O
, O

but O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
know O
anywhere O
near O
enough O
to O
actually O
and O
fairly O
assess O
the O
costs O
of O
new O
infrastructure O
, O
on O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
. O

on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
the O
newcomers O
pay O
for O
their O
own O
infrastructure O
, O
especially O
if O
we O
*require* O
them O
to O
pay O
for O
their O
own O
infrastructure O
, O
then O
we O
should O
not O
be O
too O
surprised O
if O
they O
claim O
to O
own O
it O
and O
wish O
to O
exclude O
us O
. O

this O
has O
already O
happened O
with O
some O
gated O
communities O
. O

they O
provided O
things O
like O
bike O
paths O
, O
and O
now O
the O
outside O
community O
wants O
connectivity O
to O
those O
assets O
without O
picking O
up O
part O
of O
the O
costs O
. O

it O
is O
the O
same O
with O
riparian O
setbacks O
and O
other O
increased O
demands O
on O
private O
income O

property O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
see O
how O
we O
can O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
shared O

that O
we O
all O
benefit O
from O
unless O
we O

i O
do O

`` O

i O
do O

they O

can O

i O

that O

both O
replacement O

replacement O
infrastructure O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
accomodated O
in O
an O
annual O
budget O

much O
like O
figuring O
out O
how O
many O

every O

- O

it O
's O
a O

calculation O

new O
infrastructure O
is O
not O
because O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
rate O

i O
think O
there O
would O
be O
strenuous O
disagreement O
with O

why O
this O

we O

we O
have O
such O
an O

itself O

never O

there O

just O
the O

the O

otherwise O

and O
a O
lot O

i O
guess O
now O

apparently O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
good O
camera O

apparently O
so O
, O
yes O

the O

yes O

if O

well O

you O

me O
. O

yes O
, O

have O
been O
warned O
not O

people O
are O

which O
if O
you O

anything O
about O

a O

he O

that O

an O

it O

well O
, O
when O
this O
sort O

happens O
in O
a O

and O
i O
guess O
that O
's O
a O
under O
statement O
in O
this O
case O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
all O
succeeds O
depends O
on O
how O
well O
some O
of O
the O
local O
people O
can O
keep O

are O
people O
kind O

, O
you O
know O

in O

on O

or O
are O
there O

is O
very O

there O
have O

a O

there O

none O
as O
big O
as O
this O

but O
within O

there O
was O
a O

a O

which O
is O
sort O

it O

someone O

well O
, O
i O
think O
that O
is O
the O
most O
unusual O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

i O
mean O
i O
have O
some O
friends O
who O
live O
up O
in O
there O
next O
to O
the O
woods O
and O
people O
are O
just O
surprised O
that O
they O
would O
choose O
this O
little O
tiny O
village O
in O
scotland B-GPE
. O

it O
is O
the O
juxtaposition O
of O
that O
glamour O
, O
i O
mean O
a B-PERSON
gwyneth I-PERSON
paltrow I-PERSON
in O
inverness B-GPE
. O

it O
just O
does O
n't O
sound O
what O
they O
are O
thinking O
about O
. O

and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
stella B-PERSON
mccartney I-PERSON
is O
there O
too O
and O
apparently O
celine B-PERSON
dion I-PERSON

but O
it O
is O
pretty O
amazing O
, O
all O
these O
hollywood B-GPE
stars O
in O
this O
quiet O
, O
sleepy O
village O
that O
is O
n't O
really O
famous O

anything O

so O
this O
must O
be O
a O
real O
boom O
to O
the O
local O
economy O
? O

oh O
absolutely O
, O
i O
mean O
it O
's O
been O
estimated O
that O
3 B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
, O
which O
is O
about B-MONEY
5 I-MONEY

gosh O
, O
this O
must O
be O
you O
know O

there O

yeah O
, O
absolutely O

do O
n't O
think O
they O
'll O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
all O
that O

out O
there O

there O
is O
only O

for O

the O

thus O
the B-ORG

only O
option O
was O
to O
find O
someone O

this O
was O
vital O
because O
, O
during O

it O
was O
decided O
to O

" O

" O

should O
also O

but O
it O
is O
quite O
a O
challenge O
to O
effectively O
create O
such O
a O
comprehensive O

the O

for O

each O

cheng B-PERSON

by O
assembling O
a O
number O
of O

before O

but O
he O
also O
had O
to O
try O

duplicate O
the O

color O
of O

piece O
, O
a O
color O
characteristic O
of O
shisanhang B-NORP

. O

for O
this O
reason O
cheng B-PERSON
made O
a O
special O
trip O
to O
the B-LOC

to O
collect O
red O
clay O

but O
he O
found O
this O
material O
impossible O
to O
get O
into O
the O
right O
shape O
, O
so O
he O
had O
to O
add O
a O
certain O
proportion O
of O
general O

purpose O
potter O

clay O
. O

after O
several O
tries O
, O
he O
settled O
on O
a O
combination O
of O
three B-CARDINAL

finally O
, O
he O
polished O

creating O
a O

increasing O

" O

for O

the O

he O
says O
that O
this O
is O
a O
very O

so O
its O
original O
purpose O
was O
probably O
decorative O
or O
ritualistic O
. O

in O
an O
effort O
to O
capture O
the O
ambivalent O

he O
imagined O
the O

how O
can O
he O
bring O

cheng B-PERSON
's O
response O
is O
this O
: O
" O
i O
think O
that O
the O
original O
potters O
also O
followed O
their O
whims O
and O
improvised O
when O
they O
worked O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
rigidly O
make O
each O
embellishment O
by O
rote O
. O
" O

cheng B-PERSON
considers O
the O
problem O
and O
then O
adds O
: O
" O
i O
not O
only O
want O
to O
reproduce O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
originals O
, O

also O
the O
spirit O
of O

made O

in O
the O
town O
of O
chiushe B-GPE
is O
a O
good O
illustration O
of O
cheng B-PERSON
's O
whole O
approach O
. O

upon O
inspecting O
the O
original O
, O
cheng B-PERSON
discovered O
that O
the O
walls O
were O
very O
thin O
. O

if O
the O
decorative O
pattern O
had O
been O
stamped O
on O
after O
the O
clay O
had O
been O
formed O
, O
it O
would O
certainly O
have O
ruined O
the O
shape O
. O

so O
how O
did O
the O
original O
maker O
get O
the O
pattern O
on O
there O
? O

having O
repeatedly O
thought O
about O
this O
problem O
, O
cheng B-PERSON
concluded O
that O
prehistoric O
potters O
must O
have O
used O
an O
internal O
mold O
when O
working O
. O

perhaps O
they O
had O
shards O
that O
they O
could O
just O
pick O
up O
from O
the O
ground O
around O
them O
. O

they O
could O
take O
the O
kneaded O
clay O
, O
wrap O
it O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
shards O
, O
and O
tap O
it O
down O
lightly O
with O
a O
wooden O
stick O
to O
make O
the O
clay O
more O
compact O
and O
solid O
. O

the O
stick O
would O
have O
patterns O
carved O
into O
it O
which O
would O
then O
be O
left O
imprinted O
on O
the O
clay O
. O

but O
this O
decorative O
effect O
, O
thinks O
cheng B-PERSON
, O
was O
probably O
secondary B-ORDINAL
to O
the O
functional O
purpose O
of O
compacting O
the O
clay O
. O

with O
these O
ideas O
in O
mind O
, O
cheng B-PERSON
first B-ORDINAL
ground O
up O
a O
handful O
of O
gravel O
, O
added O
it O
to O
the O
clay O
, O
and O
kneaded O
it O
vigorously O
. O

then O
he O
took O
a O
mold O
that O
had O
been O
made O
from O
the O
original O
sample O
, O
and O
spread O
the O
clay O
- O
now O
with O
the O
texture O
of O
pizza O
dough O
- O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

then O
he O
tapped O
it O
with O
a O
small O
stick O
, O
which O
he O
had O
personally O
prepared O
by O
paring O
off O
the O
bark O
and O
carving O
a O
pattern O
of O
squares O
into O
the O
wood O
. O

next O
he O
cut O
away O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
jar O
and O
carefully O
removed O
it O
. O

he O
repeated O
the O
process O
to O
make O
the O
top O
section O
, O
then O
connected O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
parts O
. O

then O
, O
with O
his O
right O
hand O
he O
picked O
up O
the O
wood O
stick O
and O
tapped O
around O
the O
outside O
, O
while O
with O
his O
left O
he O
held O
a O
mushroom O
- O
shaped O
object O
against O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
jar O
to O
absorb O
the O
shock O
and O
prevent O
the O
jar O
from O
collapsing O
inward O
. O

a O
careful O
examination O
of O
the O
finished O
jar O
- O
with O
its O
square O
pattern O
already O
imprinted O
- O
showed O
it O
to O
look O
exactly O
like O

dialogue O
with O

to O
reconstruct O
these O
36 B-CARDINAL
pieces O
of O

, O
as O
much O
as O
he O
could O
cheng B-PERSON
used O
the O
same O
tools O
as O
were O
available O
to O
their O
original O
makers O
. O

in O
particular O
, O
he O
avoided O
using O
any O
iron O
implements O
, O
since O
none O
had O
been O
available O
back O
then O
. O

when O
making O
the O
ceramic O
boar O
, O
he O
went O
into O
the O
bamboo O
forest O
in O
front O
of O
his O
house O
and O
cut O
off O
bamboo O
branches O
by O
hand O
to O
serve O

the O
pig O

. O

when O
there O
were O
no O
ready O
- O
made O

available O
, O
he O
made O

, O
such O
as O

mentioned O
" O

" O

" O
such O
a O
' O

was O
unearthed O
at O
the O
peinan B-NORP
site O
, O
" O
says O
cheng B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
archeologists O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
it O
was O
for O
. O

but O
people O
like O
me O
who O
make O
pottery O
can O
identify O
its O
function O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
look O
. O
" O

liu B-PERSON
i I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chang I-PERSON
states O
that O
his O
conversations O
with O
cheng B-PERSON
have O
given O
him O
much O
food O
for O
thought O
and O
allowed O
him O
to O
more O
accurately O
visualize O
the O
lifestyles O
and O
technology O
of O
prehistoric O
peoples O
. O

" O
we O
help O
each O
other O
a O
lot O
. O
" O

for O
instance O
, O
cheng B-PERSON
has O
brought O
his O
ceramicist O
's O
mind O
's O
eye O
to O
bear O
on O
the O
mystery O
of O
why O
gravel O
was O
mixed O
into O
prehistoric O
pottery O
. O

in O
virtually O
all O
archeological O
reports O
, O
prehistoric O
pottery O
includes O
gravel O
, O
usually O
at O
a O
level O
of O
25 B-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
30 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

some O
also O
includes O
shells O
or O
hornblende O
. O

this O
is O
definitely O
not O
because O
prehistoric O
people O
were O
unable O
to O
get O
clay O
of O
greater O
purity O
. O

on O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
clay O
they O
used O
was O
often O
of O
higher O
quality O
than O
clay O
today B-DATE
. O

thus O
cheng B-PERSON
concludes O
that O
the O
inclusion O
of O
gravel O
must O
have O
been O
deliberate O
. O

cheng B-PERSON
explains O
: O
" O
these O
days O
most O
ceramic O
artists O
buy O
factory O
- O
produced O
clay O
that O
meets O
a O
certain O
set O
of O
specifications O
. O

rarely O
would O
anybody O
add O
gravel O
. O

after O
all O
, O
everybody O
uses O
electric O
kilns O
, O
because O
they O
offer O
precise O
temperature O
control O
, O
so O
their O
pieces O
can O
be O
fired O
slowly O
, O
with O
no O
risk O
of O
cracking O
from O
overly O
rapid O
heating O
or O
cooling O
. O
" O

prehistoric O
wisdom O

but O
prehistoric O
peoples O
did O
not O
possess O
any O
of O
these O
things O
. O

they O
had O
to O
dig O
, O
rinse O
, O
and O
filter O
their O
own O
clay O
, O
shape O
the O
pieces O
, O
then O
fire O
them O
all O
together O
in O
a O
big O
pile O
of O
wood O
under O
the O
open O
sky O
. O

this O
is O
why O
they O
added O
gravel O
to O
the O
clay O
, O
liking O
mixing O
stones O
into O
mud O
, O
to O
increase O
its O
strength O
and O
so O
avoid O
having O
the O
pottery O
fracture O
as O
it O
first B-ORDINAL
expanded O
under O
the O
heat O
and O
then O
contracted O
as O
it O
cooled O
. O

from O
this O
we O
can O
see O
, O
affirms O
cheng B-PERSON
, O
that O
" O
prehistoric O
people O
understood O
how O
to O
use O
mixed O
materials O
, O
which O
was O
a O
major O
breakthrough O
in O
technique O
. O
" O

cheng B-PERSON
found O
further O
indirect O
confirmation O
of O
his O
judgement O
about O
the O
technical O
skills O
possessed O
by O
prehistoric O
makers O
of O
pottery O
from O
a O
documentary O
on O
japan B-GPE

in O
the O
film O
, O
a O
japanese B-NORP
ceramic O
artist O
, O
an O
individual O
who O
is O
considered O
a O
" O
national O
treasure O
" O
of O
japan B-GPE
, O
goes O
to O
visit O
a O
small O
island O
in O
indonesia B-GPE
where O
everybody O
makes O
pottery O
. O

when O
he O
arrives O
there O
, O
this O
great O
master O
becomes O
more O
like O
a O
youthful O
acolyte O
. O

as O
the O
japanese B-NORP
ceramicist O
slowly O
and O
steadily O
works O
the O
clay O
at O
his O
wheel O
, O
an O
elderly O
aboriginal O
woman O
working O
next O
to O
him O
just O
turns O
the O
wheel O
twice O
with O
her O
feet O
and O
shapes O
a O
finished O
ceramic O
jug O
. O

the O
ability O
of O
the O
indigenous O
people O
on O
this O
small O
island O
to O
judge O
the O
quality O
of O
clay O
was O
even O
more O
impressive O
. O

" O
they O
just O
toss O
some O
clay O
into O
their O
mouths O
and O
chew O
it O
around O
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
they O
know O
whether O
it O
is O
good O
material O
or O
not O
. O

when O
we O
buy O
clay O
, O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
we O
look O
at O
is O
the O
written O
specifications O
, O
" O

there O
are O
things O
that O
he O
could O
have O
done O
better O
. O

" O
the O
hardest O
part O
was O
getting O
the O
final O
color O

of O

to O
come O
through O
in O

" O

cheng B-PERSON
relates O
that O
in O
this O

there O
were O
some O
factors O
he O
could O
manipulate O
, O
but O
others O
that O
were O
beyond O
his O
control O
. O

" O
what O
kind O
of O

did O

use O
? O

at O
what O
temperature O
did O
they O
fire O

that O
you O

instantly O
from O

today B-DATE

" O

cheng B-PERSON
admits O
that O
if O
he O
utilized O
extraneous O
processes O
, O
such O
as O
exposing O
the O
pieces O
to O
wood O
smoke O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
he O
could O
get O
the O
colors O
closer O
to O
those O
of O
the O
actual O
artifacts O
, O
but O
then O
he O
would O
be O
losing O
something O
else O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

thus O
, O
before O
getting O
down O
to O
work O
on O
the O
final O
version O
of O
each O
piece O
, O
he O
made O
numerous O
trials O
, O
using O
different O
proportions O
of O
iron O
oxide O
, O
trying O
different O
temperatures O
, O
sometimes O
buffing O
the O
piece O
to O
make O
it O
glossy O
and O
other O
times O
not O
, O
to O
get O
as O
close O
as O
possible O
to O
the O
correct O
overall O
effect O
. O

and O
then O
of O
course O
there O
was O
the O
problem O
that O
the O
pottery O
- O
making O
process O
in O
prehistoric O
times O
was O
markedly O
different O
from O
the O
modern O
procedure O
. O

" O
these O
days O
we O
use O
electric O
kilns O

though O
they O
are O
safer O

they O
do O
not O
leave O
the O

strongly O
about O

the O

the O

can O
broadly O

divided B-PERSON

two O

in O
which O
beauty O

emphasized O

the O
more O
rugged O

northern O
style O

wang O

established O
his O
style O
relatively O
early O
, O
and O
up O
until O
he O
was O
in O

forties O
his O
works O
were O
characterized O
by O
the O
smooth O

fluid O
forms O
of O
the O
nantie O
style O
. O

however O
, O
wang O
himself O
was O
alert O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
his O
calligraphy O
becoming O
over-refined O
, O
and O
he O
began O
incorporating O
the O
robustness O
of O
the O
beibei O
style O
into B-PERSON
his O
brushwork O
, O
aiming B-CARDINAL
for B-NORP
a O
style O
that O
was B-GPE
more O
" O
raw O
and O
intense O
. O
" O

as B-ORDINAL
a O
result O
, O
his O
calligraphy O
came O
to O
combine O
fluid B-WORK_OF_ART
grace I-WORK_OF_ART
with I-WORK_OF_ART
a I-WORK_OF_ART
core O
of O
doughty O

it O
was O
a O

well O
suited O
to O
the O
kind B-ORG
of I-ORG
man I-ORG
he O
was O
: O
a O
bluff O
northerner O
with O
the O
perfectionist O

approach O
to O

. O

when O
he O
was O
in O
his O
fifties O
wang O
came O
to O
regard O
" O
writing O
characters O
" O
as O
a O
form O
of O
painting O
, O
and O
he O
began O
to O
innovate O
and B-GPE
experiment O
with O
the O
art O
. O

for O
example O
, O
he O
created O
" O
multiple O
- O
shadow O
" O
calligraphy O
, O
in O
which O
characters O
were O
painted O
in O
five O
overlapping O
layers O
using O
different O
consistencies O
of O
ink O
. O

he O
tried O
using B-GPE
deliberately O
crumpled O
paper O
to O
produce B-DATE
a O
mottled O
effect O
with O
the O
ink O
, O
and O
worked O
on O
a O
blurring O
effect O
, O
achieved O
by O
briefly O
dousing O
a O
freshly O
painted B-NORP
silk O

despite O
the O
interest B-ORG
generated B-ORG
among B-ORG
calligraphers I-ORG
by O
these B-ORG
innovations I-ORG
, O
wang O
was O
more O
suited O
by O
temperament O
to O
the O
established O
forms O
, O
and O
he O
eventually O
turned O
back O
to O

he O
studied O

the O

began O
absorbing O
their O
distinctive O

into O
his O
own O
calligraphic O
style O
. O

he O
also O
made O
poems O
and O
paired O

couplets O
out O
of O
the O
ancient O

pioneering O
a O

sometimes O

mr. O

said O
the O
most O
the O

had O
ever O

ask O

the O
ministry O
inquired O
about O
that O

which O
mr. O

declined O
to O
identify O

because O
the O
large O
presence O

he O

inquiry O
was O

that O
the O

could O
have O
interpreted O
as O
either O

he O
added O
that O
none O
of O
the O

mr. O

why O
ca O
n't O
we O
teach O
our O
children O
to O
read O
, O
write O
and O
reckon O
? O

it O
's O
not O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
, O
because O
we O
do O
. O

it O
's O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
. O

and O
the O
reason O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
is O
that O
effective O
education O
would O
require O
us O
to O
relinquish O
some O
cherished O
metaphysical O
beliefs O
about O
human O
nature O
in O
general O
and O
the O
human O
nature O
of O
young O
people O
in O
particular O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
violate O
some O
cherished O
vested O
interests O
. O

these O
beliefs O
so O
dominate O
our O
educational O
establishment O
, O
our O
media O
, O
our O
politicians O
, O
and O
even O
our O
parents O
that O
it O
seems O
almost O
blasphemous O
to O
challenge O
them O
. O

here O
is O
an O
example O
. O

if O
i O
were O
to O
ask O
a O
sample O
of O
american B-NORP
parents O
, O
`` O
do O
you O
wish O
the O
elementary O
schools O
to O
encourage O
creativity O
in O
your O
children O
? O
'' O
the O
near O
- O
unanimous O
answer O
would O
be O
, O
`` O
yes O
, O
of O
course O
. O
'' O

but O
what O
do O
we O
mean O
, O
specifically O
, O
by O
`` O
creativity O
'' O
? O

no O
one O
can O
say O
. O

in O
practice O
, O
it O
ends O
up O
being O
equated O
with O
a O
`` O
self O
- O
expression O
'' O
that O
encourages O
the O
youngsters O
' O
`` O
self O
- O
esteem O
. O
'' O

the O
result O
is O
a O
generation O
of O
young O
people O
whose O
ignorance O
and O
intellectual O
incompetence O
is O
matched O
only O
by O
their O
good O
opinion O
of O
themselves O
. O

the O
whole O
notion O
of O
`` O
creativity O
'' O
in O
education O
was O
-lrb- O
and O
is O
-rrb- O
part O
and O
parcel O
of O
a O
romantic O
rebellion O
against O
disciplined O
instruction O
, O
which O
was O
-lrb- O
and O
is O
-rrb- O
regarded O
as O
`` O
authoritarian O
, O
'' O
a O
repression O
and O
frustration O
of O
the O
latent O
talents O
and O
the O
wonderful O
, O
if O
as O
yet O
undefined O
, O
potentialities O
inherent O
in O
the O
souls O
of O
all O
our O
children O
. O

it O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
parents O
find O
this O
romantic O
extravagance O
so O
attractive O
. O

fortunately O
, O
these O
same O
parents O
do O
want O
their O
children O
to O
get O
a O
decent O
education O
as O
traditionally O
understood O
, O
and O
they O
have O
enough O
common O
sense O
to O
know O
what O
that O
demands O
. O

their O
commitment O
to O
`` O
creativity O
'' O
can O
not O
survive O
adolescent O
illiteracy O
. O

american B-NORP
education O
's O
future O
will O
be O
determined O
by O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
we O
-- O
all O
of O
us O
-- O
allow O
this O
common O
sense O
to O
prevail O
over O
the O
illusions O
that O
we O
also O
share O
. O

the O
education O
establishment O
will O
fight O
against O
common O
sense O
every O
inch O
of O
the O
way O
. O

the O
reasons O
are O
complex O
, O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
simple O
reason O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
underestimated O
. O

`` O
progressive O
education O
'' O
-lrb- O
as O
it O
was O
once O
called O
-rrb- O
is O
far O
more O
interesting O
and O
agreeable O
to O
teachers O
than O
is O
disciplined O
instruction O
. O

it O
is O
nice O
for O
teachers O
to O
think O
they O
are O
engaged O
in O
`` O
personality O
development O
'' O
and O
even O
nicer O
to O
minimize O
those O
irksome O
tests O
with O
often O
disappointing O
results O
. O

it O
also O
provides O
teachers O
with O
a O
superior O
self O
- O
definition O
as O
a O
`` O
profession O
, O
'' O
since O
they O
will O
have O
passed O
courses O
in O
educational O
psychology O
and O
educational O
philosophy O
. O

i O
myself O
took O
such O
courses O
in O
college O
, O
thinking O
i O
might O
end O
up O
a O
schoolteacher O
. O

they O
could O
all O
fairly O
be O
described O
as O
`` O
pap O
'' O
courses O
. O

but O
it O
is O
unfair O
to O
dump O
on O
teachers O
, O
as O
distinct O
from O
the O
educational O
establishment O
. O

i O
know O
many O
schoolteachers O
and O
, O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
they O
are O
seriously O
committed O
to O
conscientious O
teaching O
. O

they O
may O
not O
be O
among O
the O
`` O
best O
and O
brightest O
'' O
of O
their O
generation O
-- O
there O
are O
very O
few O
such O
people O
, O
by O
definition O
. O

but O
they O
need O
not O
be O
to O
do O
their O
jobs O
well O
. O

yes O
, O
we O
all O
can O
remember O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
truly O
inspiring O
teachers O
from O
our B-DATE
school I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

but O
our O
education O
proceeded O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
those O
others O
, O
who O
were O
merely O
competent O
and O
conscientious O
. O

in O
this O
sense O
, O
a O
teacher O
can O
be O
compared O
to O
one O
's O
family O
doctor O
. O

if O
he O
were O
brilliant O
, O
he O
probably O
would O
not O
be O
a O
family O
doctor O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
. O

if O
he O
is O
competent O
and O
conscientious O
, O
he O
serves O
us O
well O
. O

our O
teachers O
are O
not O
an O
important O
factor O
in O
our O
educational O
crisis O
. O

whether O
they O
are O
or O
are O
not O
underpaid O
is O
a O
problem O
of O
equity O
; O
it O
is O
not O
an O
educational O
problem O
. O

it O
is O
silly O
libel O
on O
our O
teachers O
to O
think O
they O
would O
educate O
our O
children O
better O
if O
only O
they O
got O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
a O
year O
more O
. O

it O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
libel O
the O
teachers O
' O
unions O
do O
n't O
mind O
spreading O
, O
for O
their O
own O
narrow O
purposes O
. O

it O
is O
also O
the O
kind O
of O
libel O
politicians O
find O
useful O
, O
since O
it O
helps O
them O
strike O
a O
friendly O
posture O
on O
behalf O
of O
an O
important O
constituency O
. O

but O
there O
is O
not O
one B-CARDINAL
shred O
of O
evidence O
that O
, O
other O
things O
being O
equal O
, O
salary O
differentials O
result O
in O
educational O
differentials O
. O

if O
there O
were O
such O
evidence O
, O
you O
can O
be O
sure O
you O
would O
have O
heard O
of O
it O
. O

if O
we O
wish O
to O
be O
serious O
about O
american B-NORP
education O
, O
we O
know O
exactly O
what O
to O
do O
-- O
and O
, O
just O
as O
important O
, O
what O
not O
to O
do O
. O

there O
are O
many O
successful O
schools O
scattered O
throughout O
this O
nation O
, O
some O
of O
them O
in O
the O
poorest O
of O
ghettos O
, O
and O
they O
are O
all O
sending O
us O
the O
same O
message O
. O

conversely O
, O
there O
are O
the O
majority O
of O
unsuccessful O
schools O
, O
and O
we O
know O
which O
efforts O
at O
educational O
reform O
are O
doomed O
beforehand O
. O

we O
really O
do O
know O
all O
we O
need O
to O
know O
, O
if O
only O
we O
could O
assimilate O
this O
knowledge O
into O
our O
thinking O
. O

in O
this O
respect O
, O
it O
would O
be O
helpful O
if O
our O
political O
leaders O
were O
mute O
, O
rather O
than O
eloquently O
`` O
concerned O
. O
'' O

they O
are O
inevitably O
inclined O
to O
echo O
the O
conventional O
pap O
, O
since O
this O
is O
the O
least O
controversial O
option O
that O
is O
open O

them O

about O

about O

-- O
`` O

is O
a O
bad O
idea O

parents O
are O
too O
likely O
to O
blame O
schools O
for O
the O
educational O
limitations O
of O

have O
the O

-- O
`` O

the O
reason O
is O

: O

where O
the O

there O

neither O

that O

the O

in O

nothing O
more O
than O
a O
thorough O
reshaping O

an O

. O

if O
the O
world O

does O
not O
change O
, O
the O

theory O
holds O
that O
the O
situation O
will O
be O
very O
harmful O
to O
outside O
financing O
in O
deficit O
economic O
systems O
. O

as O
for O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
, O
this O
will O
augur O
low O
exchange O

for O
the O

, O
and O
an O
expansion O
of O
effective O

but O
this O
did O

although O
as O
the O

approached O
the O

dropped O
somewhat O
, O
and O
effective O

continued O

, O
this O
movement O
was O
still O
very O
far O
from O
the O
radical O
adjustments O
predicted O
by O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
rebalancing O
theory O
. O

this O
phenomenon O
has O
two B-CARDINAL
possible O
explanations O
: O
one B-CARDINAL
is O
that O
other O
factors O
cropped O
up O
and O
intervened O
; O
the O
other O
is O
that O
the O
theory O
basically O
does O
not O
stand O
up O
. O

i O
choose O
the O
former O
; O
i O
believe O
the O
reason O
lies O
in O
the O
prolongation O
of O
the O
period O
of O
excess O
current O
capital O
worldwide O
and O
the O
policy O
of O

oh O
, O
hey O
bill O
. O
by O
the O
way O
, O
i O
'm O
getting O

. O

this O
is O
a O
typical O
martha B-PERSON
pronouncement O

ye- O

it O
's O
like O
, O
oh O
, O
okay O
. O

%uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
e- O
, O
tell O
me O
about O
this O
guy O
. O

how O
long O
have O
you O
known O
him O
and O
all O
that O
. O

oh O
well O
i O
've O
been O
dating O
him O
in O
since B-DATE
april I-DATE

but O
i O
have O
n't O
really O
told O
anybody O
. O

and O
i O
thought O
well O
this O
is O
true O
, O
cause O
martha B-PERSON
you O
and O
i O
have O
been O
in O
pretty O
good O
touch O
since B-DATE
april I-DATE
, O
and O
you O
never O
mentioned O
it O
. O

but O
this O
guy O
supposedly O
is O
a O
retired O
marine O
pilot O
. O

%um O
. O

he O
just O
retired O
out O
, O

so O
he O
's O
kind O
of O
thinking O
what O
he O
wants O
to O
do O
now O
. O

i O
think O
for O
some O
reason O
the O
guy O
was O
an O
a O
six B-CARDINAL
driver O
. O

and O
, O
%uh O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
just O
really O
hit O
it O
off O
and O
clicked O
. O

and O
i O
think O
he O
has O
one O
child O
but O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
custody O
. O

%um O
. O
so O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
scoop O
on O
this O
guy O
. O

but O
they O
have O
n't O
set O
a O
date O
or O
anything O
. O

they O
just O
decided O
they O
were O
going O
to O
get O
married O
, O
and O
do O
it O
real O
informal O
and O
all O
this O

and O

i O
know O
. O

so O
. O
i O
asked O
if O
he O
was O
drinking O
buddies O
with O
luke B-PERSON

and O
that O
did O
n't O
go O
over O
real O
good O
. O

so O
. O
so O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
the O
scoop O
. O

but O
, O
%uh O
, O
she O
's O
still O
in O
san B-GPE
diego I-GPE
and O
seems O
to O
have O
settled O
pretty O
much O
there O

applied O
for O
a O
fellowship O
to O
work O
with O
the O
joint O
commission O
-amp-on O
accreditation O

mhm O
which O
would O
have O
been O
a O

long O
out O
service O
fellowship O
up O
in O
chicago B-GPE
which O

the O
, O
the O
town O
that O

ten B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
from O

%uh O
, O
they O
picked O

out O
there O

be O
the O

but O
, O
%um O
you O

, O
i O

specialty O
in O
that O

and O
-- O
sure O

terminal O
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O

okay O
i O
think O

um O
, O
i O
'll O
explain O
here O
in O
particular O
, O
because O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
communication O
, O
ah O
, O
between O
the O
coalition O
happiness O
has O
actually O
gone O
on O
for O
a O
very O

. O

and O
chairman O
soong B-PERSON
, O
uh O
, O
he O
has O
also O
taken O
into O
consideration O
that O
because O
he O
himself O
is O
a O
candidate O
in O
taipei B-GPE
, O
in O
the O
future O
it O
might O
not O
be O

him O
to O
routinely O
meet O
directly O
with O
chairman O
ma B-PERSON
regarding O
certain O

uh-huh O

so O
he O
especially O
handed O
over O
to O
me O
the O
role O
of O
representing O
him O
in O
future O
affairs O
between O
the O
two O

of O

and O
to O
represent O

ma B-PERSON
. O

um O
, O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
i O
have O
indeed O
represented O
chairman O
james B-PERSON
soong I-PERSON
in O
meeting O
with O
chairman O
ma B-PERSON
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
and O
we O
discussed O
many O
issues O
concerning O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
parties O
' O
affairs O
. O

and O
as O
for O
that O
thing O
that O
chairman O
ma B-PERSON
wrote O
, O
it O
was O
because O
after O
that O
thing O
-- O
about O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
people O
meeting O
-- O
got O
out O
, O
outsiders O
had O
a O
lot O

doubts O

so O
in O
this O

, O
he O
was O
also O
particularly O
hoping O
that O
i O
could O
pass O
on O
the O
plan O
the O

of O

in O
sizing O
up O
the O
risks O
of O
stock O

market O
investments O
, O
there O
's O
probably O
no O
starting O
place O
better O
than O
`` O
beta O

'' O

but O
investors O
better O
not O
ignore O
its O
limitations O
, O
either O
. O

beta O
is O
a O
handy O
gauge O
that O
measures O
the O
volatility O
of O
a O
stock O
or O
stock O
mutual O
fund O
. O

for O
any O
given O
move O
in O
the O
overall O
market O
, O
it O
suggests O
how O
steeply O
that O
particular O
issue O
might O
rise O
or O
fall O
. O

beta O
figures O
are O
widely O
available O
and O
easy O
to O
interpret O

the O
beta O
of O
the O
broad O
market O
, O
typically O
defined O
as O
the B-ORG
standard I-ORG
-amp- I-ORG
poor I-ORG
's I-ORG
500-stock B-CARDINAL
index O
, O
is O
always O
1.0 B-CARDINAL
. O

so O
a O
stock O
with O
a O
beta O
of O
0.5 B-CARDINAL
is O
half B-CARDINAL
as O
volatile O
, O
one O
at O
1.5 B-CARDINAL
is O
50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
more O
volatile O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

cautious O
investors O
should O
generally O
go O
with O
stocks O
that O
have O
low O
betas O
. O

go O
with O
high O
- O
beta O
stocks O
to O
get O
the O
biggest O
payoff O
from O
a O
bet O
on O
a O
bull O
market O
. O

remember O
, O
though O
, O
that O
beta O
also O
has O
important O
limitations O

why O
? O

i O
do O
n't O
know O

she O
kind O
of O
, O

well O
unfortunately O
for O
some O
reason O
she O
's O
not O
like O
into O
cardio O
vascular O
. O

so O
when O
i O
'm O
still O
riding O
the O

she O
's O
completely O
finished O
her O
weight O
lifting O
e- O
, O
routine O
. O

mhm O
. O

and O
like O
i O
have O
n't O
even O
started O
mine O
. O
mhm O
. O
you O
know O

and O
i O
kind O
of O
hinted O
to O
her O
that O
really O
the O
only O
way O
to O
lose O
weight O
is O
cardio O
vascular O
. O
mhm O
. O
it O
's O
true O
. O
and O
that O
lifting O
the O
weights O
wo O
n't O
lose O
weight O
. O

%mm O
%mm O
. O

you O
wo O
n't O
lose O
it O
, O
you O
know O
, O

but O

no O

i O
mean O
you O
might O
lose O
some O

but O
that O
's O
only O
when O
yo- O
. O

for O
a O
woman O
who O
is O
lifting O
not O
that O
much O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
yeah O
. O
you O
would O
. O

i O
mean O
yeah O

i O
mean O
the O
only O
thing O
is O
%um O
just O
getting O
your O
heart O
rate O
up O
for O
extended O
periods O
of O
time O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
i O
do O
n't O
know O

maybe O
she O
'll O
catch O
on O
soon O
. O

you O
do O
burn O
a O
lot O
of O
calories O
an O
hour O
though O
, O
lifting O
weights O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

but O
%uh O

yeah O

i O
mean O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
, O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
lose O
that O
much O
. O

n- O
, O
and O
also O
lifting O
weights O
at O
bally B-FAC
's I-FAC
means O
you O
're O
standing O
on O
line O
as O
for O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
're O
actually O
lifting O
. O

really O
. O

yeah O
. O

that O
's O
too O
bad O
. O

yeah O
. O

so O
it O
's O
is O
it O
really O
overcrowded O
? O

well O
, O
i O
mean O
obviously O
since O
i O
work O
i O
ca O
n't O
get O
there O

about B-TIME
six I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
at O

is O
when O
everyone O
else O
gets O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

but O
i O
me- O
i O
'm O
sure O
for O
people O
who O
go O
in O
the B-TIME
daytime I-TIME
it O
's O
probably O
dead O
. O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O

and O
i O
go O
%um O
, O
like O
when O
i O
go O
saturday B-TIME

to O
the O
-- O
-- O

%mm O
. O
that O
's O
okay O
. O

is O
kind O
of O
goofy O
. O

yeah O
. O

well O
i O
guess O
she O
did O
that O
to O
, O
because O
someone O
suggested O
that O
to O
her O
because O
you O

the O
lillies O

in O
america B-GPE

it O
breaks O
my O
heart O
when O

that O

they O
think O
the B-GPE

they O
take O
they O
take O
the O
good O
and O
the O
bad O
all O
the O

and O
that O
's O
t- O

yeah O

oh O
it O
's O
pitiful O

that O
makes O
me O
very O
very O
sad O

you O
know O
oh O
it O
's O
%eh O

very O
sad O

an- O
and O
even O
the O
russians B-NORP
the- O
they O
come O
over O

and O
i O

we O

we O

the O
more O

the B-DATE

what O
we O
risk O

greater O
public O

a O

of O

i O
remember O
an O

this O
from O

eh O
, O
after O

the O

is O
actually O

there O
are O
one B-QUANTITY

as O

the O

ultimately O
, O
whether O
the O

worthwhile O
depends O
on O
the O

that O

right O
to O
buy O
shares O
at O
a O

price O
until O

. O

selling O
a O

gives O
an O

a O
small O
buffer O
against O
a O
stock O

decline O

that O

and O
so O
fox B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
use O
his O
marketing O
sensibility O
to O
try O
to O
convince O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
that O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

remember O
, O
fox B-PERSON
comes O
from O
a O
strong O
marketing O
background O
. O

he O
was O
the O
executive O
of O
coca B-ORG
- I-ORG
cola I-ORG
from O
mexico B-GPE
, O
so O
he O
understands O
how O
these O
things O
work O
. O

i O
wonder O
if O
you O
can O
tell O
us O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
something O
that O
cuban B-NORP
president O
fidel B-PERSON
castro I-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
also O
there O
today O
, O
said O
earlier O
in O
the B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

he O
said O
that O
the O
previous O
president O
ernesto B-PERSON
zedillo I-PERSON
was O
too O
much O
of O
a O
servant O
to O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
. O

is O
that O
issue O
something O
that O
fox B-PERSON
is O
likely O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
? O

is O
that O
kind O
of O
a O
warning O
for O
fox B-PERSON
at O
all O
? O

that O
's O
definitely O
a O
message O
to O
vicente B-PERSON
fox I-PERSON
from O
fidel B-PERSON
castro I-PERSON
and O
i O
am O
sure O
that O
other O
latin B-NORP
american I-NORP
presidents O
feel O
the O
same O
way O
, O
but O
fox B-PERSON
really O
has O
already O
shown O
very O
early O
on O
that O
he O
is O
going O
to O
try O
to O
be O
an O
unusual O
kind O
of O
leader O
with O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
, O
he O
is O
not O
going O
to O
kowtow O
to O
washington B-GPE
. O

in O
fact O
, O
just O
weeks B-DATE
after O
he O
was O
elected O
he O
showed O
washington B-GPE
that O
he O
has O
his O
own O
initiatives O
and O
some O
of O
them O
might O
even O
frighten O
leaders O
in O
our O
national O
capital O
there O
, O
so O
i O
think O
you O
can O
expect O
fox B-PERSON
to O
continue O
the O
economic O
policies O
that O
mexico B-GPE
has O
been O
criticized O
for O
, O
that O
is O
following O
the O
economic O
lead O
of O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE

, O
but O
at O
the O

time O
he O
will O
come O
up O
with O
concrete O
policies O
for O
dealing O
with O

without O

said O
that O
the O

is O
a O
mirror O
of O
the O
saudi B-NORP
economy O
. O
but O
if O
the O

was O
exaggerated O
then O
there O
would O
be O
a O
difference O
between O
the O

of O

in O
general O
and O
the O

and O
this O
is O
what O

he O
offered O
a O

suggestions O
to O
the B-ORG
ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG

to O
help O
the O
companies O
, O
namely O
: O
to O
allow O
companies O
to O
buy O
their O

immediately O
which O
would O
give O
trust O
in O
the O
market O
and O
would O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
dealt O
in O

on O
the O
market O
and O
thus O
increase O
the O
amount O
of O
profit O
; O
to O
allow O
non-saudi B-NORP
companies O
and O
corporations O
to O
enter O
the O

by O
placing O

such O
as O

an O

a O
discussion O
with O

by O
sending O
them O
letters O

. O

this O
is O
done O
by O
all O

in O

with O
the O
aim O
of O
obliging O

achieve O
the O
declared O

or O
something O
close O
to O
it O
and O
to O
re-assure O
the O

. O

finally O
, O
more O
disclosures O
between O
the O
company O

the O
investor O
, O
since O
there O
are O
companies O
with O
specific O

achieving O
strategies O
not O
from O
its O
basic O

, O
such O
as O
achieving O
non-repeatable O

. O

he O
added O
: O
" O
we O
wish O
to O
remove O
the O
weak O
companies O
that O

not O
represent O
the O

them O

prince O

denied O
that O
the B-ORG
kingdom I-ORG
holding I-ORG
company I-ORG
had O
liquidized O
any O

it O
had O
in O
the O
kingdom B-GPE
, O

but O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
had O
increased O
its O

in O
a O
number O
of O

, O
and O
in O
addition O
did O
not O
enter O
into O

at O
all O
but O
is O
working O

keeping O
for O

he O
also O
denied O
that O
the O
collapse O
of O
last B-DATE
february I-DATE
was O
planned O
by O
any O
party O
, O
but O
it O
rather O
occurred O
because O
of O
the O
illogical O
prices O
reached O
by O
the O
market O
. O

he O
indicated O
that O
the O
collapse O
was O
expected O
because O
of O
the O
inflation O
in O

prices O
and O
said O
that O
any O

familiar O
with O

will O
confirm O
that O
the O

was O
imminent O
at O
that O
time O
. O

he O
explained O
that O
the O

could O
not O
in O
any O
way O
be O
made O
responsible O
for O
the O
losses O
of O
investors O
on O
the O
market O
and O
must O
remain O
neutral O
on O
that O
. O

the O
role O
of O
the O
state O
is O
to O
prevent O
the O
manipulators O
from O
exposing O
the O
market O
to O
fluctuations O
, O
to O
punish O
them O
and O
to O
suspend O
bankrupt O

. O

he O
pointed O
out O
that O
there O
is O
a O
study O
on O
dividing O
the O
market O
because O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
place O
profitable O
, O
strong O
companies O
alongside O
weak O
loss O
- O
making O

, O
and O
this O
is O
where O
the B-ORG

plays O
a O

he O
called O
upon O
the O

not O
the O

to O
go O
to O

in O

so O
as O

. O

as O
for O
the O
stagnation O
in O

, O
it O
is O

, O
because O

, O
the O

this O

two B-CARDINAL
sides O

: O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
to O
send O

authority I-ORG
that O
he O
does O
not O
want O

create O
a O
very O
strong O
imaginary O
surge O

and O
this O
might O
mean O
that O
the B-ORG
market I-ORG
authority I-ORG
is O
being O
informed O
that O
he O
will O
be O
satisfied O
with O
less O
profit O

his O

the O
second B-ORDINAL
: O
to O

the O

' O
belief O

them O

the O
small O
investors O

" O

in O
this O
clause O

the O
statement O
he O
is O
assuring O

that O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
dispose O
of O
his O
shares O
to O
them O
through O
this O
action O
of O
his O
, O
and O
so O
they O
should O
enter O

raise O
up O
the O
index O
of O
his O
companies O

" O
the B-ORG

? O

well O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

tell O
me O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
america B-GPE
. O

i O
have O
n't O
seen O
the O
news O
in O
ages O
. O

really O
? O

you O
did O
d- O

in O
the O
american B-NORP
news O
i O
mean O

i O
know O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
russia B-GPE

but O

yeah O
. O

well O
let O
's O
see O
. O

what O
's O
going O
on O
? O
%uh O

you O
want O
me O
to O
just O
give O
you O
some O
headlines O
? O

yeah O
. O

give O
me O
some O
headlines O
. O

what O
's O
clinton B-PERSON
up O
to O
? O

up- O

yeah O
. O

i O
was O
just O
going O
to O
say O
clinton B-PERSON
just O
came O
out O
yesterday O
with O
his O
%uh O
his O
statement O
concerning O
affirmative O
action O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
, O
and O
basically O
he O
has O
in O
the O
past O
said O
that O
he O
was O
not O
in O
favor O
of O
%uh O
you O
know O
of O
making O
%um O
al- O
allowances O
strictly O
based O
on O
race O

but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
%uh O
the O
analysis O
in O
the O
news O
shall O
we O
say O
the O
conservative O
analysis O
in O
the O
news O
is O
that O
clinton O
just O
came O
out O
and O
said O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
believe O
in O
quota O
systems O
and O
in O
reverse O
discrimination O
but O
that O
he O
does O
believe O
that O
affirmative O
action O
is O
necessary O
to O
move O
%uh O
you O
know O
black O
americans B-NORP
forward O
and O
to O
give O
them O
the O
opportunities O
that O
they O
've O
been O
denied O
. O

so O
he O
's O
trying O
to O
, O
k- O
kind O
of O
walking O
a O
tight O
rope O
. O

you O
know O
what O
i O
'm O
saying O
? O

right O
. O

in O
other O
words O
l- O

he O
's O
trying O
to O
please O
everybody O
. O

yeah O
. O

let O
's O
see O
if O
we O
can O
make O
everybody O
happy O

i O
think O
that O
he O
's O

then O
he O
just O
ends O
up O
making O
nobody O
happy O
. O

i O
think O
you O
're O
right O
. O

because O
you O
know O
affirmative O
action O
is O
really O
under O
attack O
in O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
on O
, O
from O
many O
different O
quarters O
right O
now O
. O

and O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
big O
, O
it O
's O
a O
big O
issue O
because O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
gender O
, O
i O
mean O
not O
a O
gender O
a O
race O

%uh O
color O
blind O

we O
're O
supposed O
to O
be O
race O
color O
blind O

and O
yet O
it O
's O
like O
contractors O
that O
are O
bidding O
you O
know O
with O
a O
high O
bid O
or O
higher O
than O
-- O
the O
lowest O
bid O
are O
still O
getting O
the O
contracts O
only O
because O
they O
are O
of O
ethnic O
protected O
you O
know O
black O
or O
whatever O
. O

and O
it O
's O
really O
you O
know O

right O
. O

and O
then O
, O
then O
so O
they O
're O
taking O
lawsuits O
to O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
and O
all O
of O
this O

so O
it O
's O

wow O
. O

another O
thing O
that O
just O
came O
up O
was O
that O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
said O
that O
the O
redistricting O
of O
the O
congressional O
districts O
one O
of O
which O
is O
in O
georgia B-GPE
violated O
the O
constitution B-WORK_OF_ART
because O
it O
was O
based O
primarily O
on O
race O
. O

there O
was O
you O
know O
a O
new O

what O
did O
they O
do O
i- O

they O
were O
doing O
it O
because O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
it O
more O
e- O
like O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
it O
less O
segregated O
? O

they O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
the O
district O
majority O
black O
americans B-NORP

so O
therefore O
they O
drew O
it O
%uh O
all O
the O
way O
across O
the O
state O
. O

you O
see O
what O
i O
'm O
saying O
? O

oh O
right O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

a O
, O
a O
very O
narrow O
district O

and O
it O
created O
a O
majority O
black O
district O
which O
then O
elected O
a O
, O
a O
black O
representative O

and O
then O
it O
was O
challenged O
because O
it O
said O
well O
the O
only O
reason O
that O
it O
has O
been O
done O
this O
way O
is O
just O
to O
ensure O
that O
it O
was O
majority O
black O

and O
that O
's O
not O

right O

you O
know O

hello O
? O

i O
'm O
here O
. O

okay O
. O

anyway O

i O
'm O
mulling O
all O
this O
over O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
mean O
it O
's O
, O
it O

so O
it O
's O
interesting O
because O
today O
we O
had O
a O
discussion O
with O
students O
about O
%um O
because O
we O
're O
doing O
a O
pre-departure O
orientation O

so O
we O
were O
, O
we O
had O
our O
hot O
topics O
discussion O
today O
where O
we O
break O
in O
small O
groups O

and O
we O
talked O
about O
like O
political O
correctness O
and O
racial O
prejudice O
and O
sexual O
harrassment O
, O
feminism O
and O
just O
like O
different O
topics O
that O
they O
might O
encounter O
in O
america O
where O
the O
people O
have O
different O
attitudes O
than O
here O
in O
russia B-GPE
. O

so O
that O
was O
one O
of O
the O
things O
kind O
of O
like O
that O

but O
i O
have O
i O
'm O
not O
really O
up O
on O
what O
the O
attitude O
is O
in O
america B-GPE
because O
i O
have O
n't O
been O
there O
in O
so O
long O
. O

well O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
frustration O
i O
think O
over O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
're O
, O
there O
're O
a O
number O
of O
evidences O
that O
the O
affirmative O
action O
program O
is O
in O
fact O
discriminating O
in O
the O
other O
direction O

and O
people O
are O
saying O
wait O
a O
minute O
. O

why O
do O
n't O
we O
just O
give O
everybody O
%uh O
%uh O
%uh O
an O
e- O
try O
to O
give O
everybody O
an O
equal O
shot O

and O
if O
someone O
feels O
that O
they O
've O
been O
discriminated O
against O
because O
of O
their O
race O
go O
at O
it O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
, O
of O
trying O
to O
remedy O
it O
through O
the O
courts O
rather O
than O
saying O
that O
government O
has O
to O
give O
x O
number O
of O
contracts O
to O
minority O
no O
matter O
what O
. O

right O
. O

and O
as O
a O
result O
some O
%uh O
m- O
some O
people O
are O
getting O
contracts O
just O
because O
of O
the O
color O
of O
their O
skin O

and O
you O
know O
what O
i O
'm O
saying O

it O
's O
, O
it O
's O
, O
it O
's O
still O

when O
they O
might O
not O
even O
be O
the O
most O
qualified O
. O

e- O
either O
them O
they O
're O
, O
they O
're O
not O
even O
, O
they O
're O
not O
the O
low O
bid O

you O
know O
normally O
on O
contracts O
you O
take O
the O
low O
bid O
that O
meets O
the O
quality O
spec- O
specification O
. O

right O
. O

and O
but O
now O
you O
've O
, O
there O
have O
been O
several O
cases O
where O
clearly O
you O
know O
it O
was O
, O
they O
did O
n't O
get O
it O
because O
they O
just O
did O
n't O
were O
n't O
the O
right O
color O
skin O
. O

so O
now O
is O
that O
right O
. O
is O
that O
really O
remedying O
the O
situation O

or O
is O
it O
's O
creating O
a O
lot O
of O
%uh O
of O
%uh O
resentment O
? O

and O
%uh O
right O
. O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
too O
bad O
. O

how O
long O

god O
what O
a O
mess O
. O

oh O
it O
's O
a O
mess O
. O

it O
really O
is O
. O

w- O
how O
long O
have O
you O
been O
there O
by O
the O
way O
? O

here O
? O

%um O

'll O
be O

. O

so O
you O
really O
are O
out O
of O
touch O
are O
n't O
you O
? O

well O
i O
like O
to O
think O
i O
'm O
not O
totally O
out O
of O
touch O

well O
y- O
i O
know O
what O
it O
's O
like O
. O

i O
was O
never O
very O
in O
touch O
even O
when O
i O
was O
still O
america B-GPE

so O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

you O
're O
that O
type O
. O

i O
got O
you O
. O

i O
was O
always O
in O
my O
, O
in O
my O
own O
world O
anyway O

so O
. O

well O
i O
know O
what O
it O
's O
like O
because O
i O
've O
went O
, O
having O
lived O

of O
course O
when O
you O
get O
to O
be O
over O
forty O
like O
me O
%um O
, O
you O
can O
miss O
that O
stuff O

an O
american B-NORP
anyway O

miami B-GPE
i O

. O

but O
it O
it O

these O
are O
the O
characteristics O
of O
our O
chinese B-NORP

, O
and O
because O
we O
have O
these O
characteristics O
, O
we O
won O
the O
attention O
of O
foreign O
friends O
. O

therefore O
, O
any O
work O
that O
can O
follow O
tradition O
but O
not O
stagnate O
, O
and O
have O
new O
artistic O

this O

outstanding O

one B-CARDINAL
kind O
of O
situation O
embarrassed O
the O
judges O
, O
namely O
, O
that O
some O
works O
displayed O
really O
beautifully O
written O
characters O
, O
conformed O
to O
a O
certain O
calligraphy O
style O
, O
and O
showed O
signs O
of O
new O
achievement O
in O
art O
form O
, O
but O
regretfully O
, O
because O
the O
calligraphers O
have O
poor O
basic O
knowledge O
, O
they O
wrote O
some O
wrong O
characters O
, O
and O
since O
there O
was O
no O
remedy O
, O
finally O
lost O
in O
the O
selection O
. O

everyone O
both O
felt O
pity O
for O
them O
, O
and O
felt O
that O
this O
is O
an O
issue O
very O
worth O
worrying O
about O
. O

some O
young O
calligraphy O
lovers O
, O
just O
at O
the O
time O
when O
they O
should O
have O
been O
studying O
hard O
, O
were O
hindered O
. O

so O
basic O
knowledge O
was O
not O
enough O
, O
structure O
was O
not O
systematic O
, O
and O
the O
level O
was O
rather O
low O
. O

they O
have O
some O
ability O
in O
calligraphy O
, O
but O
eventually O
can O
not O
produce O
a O
final O
masterpiece O
at O
a O
higher O
level O
, O
and O
can O
not O
create O
works O
which O
may O
be O
used O
as O
teaching O
models O
. O

we O
sincerely O
hope O
that O
these O
friends O
will O
amend O
this O
aspect O
quickly O
, O
and O
hope O
future O
works O
will O
show O
both O
superior O
capability O
in O
calligraphy O
, O
and O
convey O
healthy O
and O
deep O
thoughts O
, O
and O
even O
reveal O
a O
clear O
, O
meaningful O
and O
elegant O
mind O
. O

this O
is O
the O
eager O
expectation O
that O
many O

have O
placed O
on O

nearly O
40 B-PERCENT

the O
random O

of O
this O

mainly O
involved O
the O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
batches O
of O
plastic O

for O
food O
packaging O
and O
cutting O

manufactured O
by O
twelve B-CARDINAL

a O
total O
of O
five B-CARDINAL

the O

failed O

, O
of O
which O
three B-CARDINAL
batches O
are O
plastic O

. O

the O
main O
existing O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
residue O
after O
evaporation O
exceeds O
the O
limit O
. O

according O
to O
the O
information O
, O
the O
residue O
after O
evaporation O
refers O
to O
the O
chemical O
substances O
possibly O
produced O
by O
plastic O
products O
when O
coming O
into O
contact O
with O
water O
, O
vinegar O
, O

, O
and O
other O
liquids O
during O
use O
. O

these O
chemical O
substances O
are O
often O
harmful O
to O
the O
human O
body O
. O

some O
individual O
production O

add O
excessive O
amounts O
of O
talc O
, O
calcium O
carbonate O
, O
and O
other O
substances O
into O
their O
products O
in O
order O
to O
increase O
the O
hardness O
of O
the O
plastic O
cutting O
boards O
. O

this O
is O
the O
main O
reason O
resulting O
in O
the O
failure O
of O
these O
products O
to O
pass O
. O

experts O
suggest O
that O
when O
shopping O
for O
a O
plastic O
cutting O
board O
, O
choose O
the O
plastic O
cutting O
board O
that O
is O
evenly O
colored O
and O
has O
no O
impurities O
or O
pungent O
smell O
. O

in O
addition O
, O
during O
use O
, O
it O
is O
best O
not O
to O
use O
it O
to O
cut O
very O
hot O
food O
because O
high O
temperature O
will O
accelerate O
the O
decomposition O
of O
harmful O
chemical O
substances O
so O
that O
they O
will O
enter O
the O

for O
many O

one B-CARDINAL

this O

has O
increased O
the O
difficulties O
of O
chinese B-NORP
becoming O

citizens O
, O
and O
has O
resulted O
in O
quite O
some O
repercussions O
among O
the O
chinese B-NORP
community O
. O

let O
us O
look O
at O
a O
report O
from O
the O
american B-NORP

after O
the B-ORG

announced O
the O
questions O
for O
the O
new O

exam O
, O
there O
were O
mixed O
reactions O
within O
the O
chinese B-NORP
communities O
, O
in O
particular O
from O
some O
of O
the O
elderly O
who O
wished O
to O
become O
citizens O
. O

some O
felt O
that O
it O
would O
be O
more O
difficult O
to O
become O
naturalized O
citizens O
from O
now O
on O
. O

some O
citizenship O
classes O
are O
also O
forced O
to O
update O
their O
existing O
curricula O
. O

it O
is O
generally O
believed O
that O
the O
revised O
naturalization O
questions O
will O
increase O
the O
difficulty O
of O
the O
exam O
. O

currently O
, O
most O
of O
the O
questions O
only O
require O
simple O
answers O
to O
be O
satisfactory O
. O

however O
, O
from O
the O
known O
portions O
of O
the O
new O
exam O
questions O
, O
future O
exams O
will O
assess O
naturalization O
applicants O
' O
knowledge O
in O
areas O
like O
american B-NORP
social O
and O
political O
history O
; O
and O
applicants O
need O
to O
extend O
and O
elaborate O
their O
answers O
. O

for O
instance O
, O
current O
applicants O
only O
need O
to O
know O
that O
the O
structure O
of O
the B-ORG
u.s. I-ORG
government I-ORG
is O
a O
separation O
of O
powers O
among O
the O
legislative O
, O
executive O
, O
and O
judicial O
branches O
, O
but O
future O
applicants O
will O
need O
to O
answer O
why O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
such O
a O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

so O
for O
those O
who O
do O
not O
have O

they O
will O
usually O

this B-DATE

came O
with O
great O

for O
china B-GPE
. O

before O
the O

, O
the O
gap O
between O
china B-GPE

was O
far O
greater O
than O
mere O

. O

before O
the O

200,000 B-QUANTITY

. O

japan B-GPE

was O
about O
9 B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY

the O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
japan B-GPE
had O
a O
complete O
industrial O
system O
and O
was O
able O
to O
independently O
produce O
all O
its O
weapons O
, O
from O
handguns O
to O
aircraft O
carriers O
, O
and O
it O
had O
a O
formidable O
research O
production O
capacity O

at O
that O
time O
, O
every O

to O
produce O
1,580 B-CARDINAL

744 B-CARDINAL

compared O
to O
this O
, O
at O
the O
time O
china B-GPE
could O
only O
produce O
rifles O
and O
small O
cannon O
; O
its O
capacity O
to O
produce O
heavy O

was O
zero B-CARDINAL

the O
only O

of O
producing O
heavy O

in O
the O
northeast O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
japanese B-NORP
. O

this O
means O
that O
china B-GPE

consumption O
could O
not O
be O
met O
. O

before O
the O
war O
, O
china B-GPE

some O
300 B-CARDINAL

that O
may O
seem O

they O
were O

the O

that O

china B-GPE
had O
basically O
no O

the O

relied O
primarily O
on O

these O
so O

called O

all O
they O
could O

was O
learn O

therefore O
, O
in O

it O
was O
not O
just O
the O
difference O

even O
more O

were O
the O

tell O

your O
opinion O
on O
the O
baker B-ORG

recommendations O
? O

first O
of O
all O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
, O
and O
as O
it O
is O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
the O
report O
is O
written O
for O
the O
us B-NORP
administration O
and O
not O
for O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
people O
. O

it O
also O
seems O
, O
as O
far O
as O
i O
know O
, O
that O
it O
represents O
recommendations O
and O
reviews O
rather O
than O
decisions O
. O

the O
decision O
remains O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
us B-NORP
administration O
. O

and O
i O
know O
that O
much O
of O
its O
content O
does O
not O
represent O
the O
will O
and O
direction O
followed O
by O
the O
administration B-ORG
. O

i O
can O
also O
say O
that O
it O
set O
off O
from O
shaky O
ground O
, O
because O
the O
review O
was O
not O
complete O
in O
covering O
the O
entire O
background O
and O
its O
outcome O
after O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
regime O
. O

and O
it O
should O
have O
reviewed O
events O
more O
accurately O
, O
and O
made O
them O
into O
a O
fertile O
ground O
for O
a O
solution O
. O

however O
, O
the O
report O
brought O
together O
contradictions O
in O
the O
vision O
and O
recommendations O
. O

the O
vision O
that O
we O
find O
at O
the O
beginning O
may O
differ O
from O
the O
vision O
towards O
the O
end O
and O
the O
initial O
recommendations O
differ O
from O
the O
recommendations O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
perhaps O
due O
to O
it O
being O
written O
by O
multiple O
authors O
or O
for O
having O
a O
muddled O
vision O
. O

but O
they O
expressed O
it O
and O
said O
there O
are O
no O
magic O
solutions O
. O

perhaps O
the O
reality O
that O
iraq B-GPE
and O
the O
region O
are O
going O
through O
may O
impose O
itself O
through O
the O
difficulties O
encountered O
by O
those O
who O
think O
they O
are O
providing O
the O
solution O
. O

but O
if O
i O
were O
asked O
to O
briefly O
, O
uh O
, O
evaluate O
the O
report O
, O
i O
would O
say O
that O
it O
is O
not O
lacking O
in O
good O
indications O
related O
to O
%pw O
the O
political O
course O
and O
the O
unity O
of O
iraq B-GPE

however O
, O
it O

not O

either O
of O
offences O
or O
negative O
trends O
regarding O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
course O

the O

to O

all O
of O
these O
are O

to O
examine O
the O
positive O
