now O
! O

the O
newspaper O
described O
" O
fadil B-PERSON
" O
as O
a O
valuable O

the O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O

which O
are O

this O

not O

elsa B-PERSON

one O
year O
in O
fact O
when O
i O
was O
there O
lida B-PERSON
and O
irv B-PERSON
were O

they O
spend O
a O
month O
in O
tucson B-GPE
every O
year O
. O

mhm O
. O

i O
think O
it O
's O
february B-DATE
you O
know O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
winter O
. O

sure O
. O

oh O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
winter O
right O
. O

yeah O

and O
%um O
i O
know O
i O
've O
met O
her O
each O
time O
. O

he O
must O
be O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
salesman O
because O
both O
times O
i O
think O
he O
was O
in O
texas B-GPE
which O
is O
n't O
far O
you O
know O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
mhm O
. O
when O
you O
're O
in O
that O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O

sure O

right O

i O
know O
it O
's O
close O
. O

%um O
but O
always O
on O
business O

and O
i O
remember O
they O
told O
me O
that O
he O
's O
gone O
a O
lot O
so O
he O
's O
you O
know O
he O
's O
in O
and O
out O
but O
that O
she O
manages O
very O
well O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O
mhm O

they O
all O
felt O
she O
was O
just O
a O
great O
mother O
you O
know O
the O
way O
she O
took O
care O
of O
her O
kids O
. O

th- O
that O
's O
wonderful O

%uh O
you O
know O
%uh O
i O
think O
you O
learn O
a O
lot O
when O
you O
have O
such O
a O
big O
family O

you O
learn O
how O
to O
juggle O
i- O
juggle O
it O
around O
you O
know O
. O

really O
. O

real- O
really O
. O

yeah O
. O

and O
apparently O
she O

%uh O
%eh O
my O
impression O
is O
they O
're O
not O
wealthy O
you O
know O

in O
fact O
i O
got O
the O
impression O
they O
're O
they O
were O
struggling O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
%uh O
that O
's O
elsa B-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
when O
the O
babies O
were O
little O

well O
you O
know O
the O
big O
family O
like O
that O
right O
. O

yeah O

and O
she O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
working O
very O
much O
at O
that O
point O
if O
at O
all O
. O

either O

right O
right O
. O

yeah O
. O

and O
so O
probably O
one O
%uh O
income O
just O
you O
know O
was O
making O
it O

%eh O
makes O
it O
hard O
of O
course O
. O

yeah O

you O
know O
. O

now O
is O
n't O
there O
another O
daughter O

or O
do O
n't O

is O
is O
it O
another O
daughter O
or O
another O
son O
? O

oh O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
i O
'm O
not O
sure O
either O

what O
's O
there O

uh-huh O
. O

i O
've O
only O
met O
those O
two B-CARDINAL

but O
you O
're O
right O

there O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
chil- O

i O
think O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
another O
child O
. O

%uh O
i O
'm O
positive O
you O
're O
right O

%eh O
it O
just O
registered O
. O

right O
. O

it O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
they O
may O
even O
have O
said O
something O
about O
him O

but O
i O
never O
met O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
one O

so O
you O
know O
i O
do O
n't O
have O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O
it O
did O
n't O
r- O
i- O
stick O
with O
me O
whatever O
they O
said O
. O

that O
was O
nice O
to O
see O
family O
you O
know O
%uh O
over O
the O
years O

it O
's O
very O
interesting O
. O

mhm O
. O

is O
n't O
it O
? O

mhm O
. O

do O
you O
ever O
see O
abe B-PERSON
? O

he O
also O
lives O
in O
ann B-GPE
arbor I-GPE
. O

he O
's O
very O
sick O
. O

oh O
. O

he O
had O
major O
surgery O
four B-CARDINAL
or O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE

and O
he O
walked O
around O
that O
i O
remember O
. O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
like O
a O
walking O
skeleton O
. O

mhm O
. O

and O
the O
only O
time O
i O
see O
him O
now O
is O
if O
i O
call O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
come O

mhm O
. O

and O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
now O
that O
you O
mention O
it O

it O
's O
been O
about O
a O
year O
. O

mhm O
. O

before O
you O
know O
when O
he O
was O
still O
quite O
well O
he O
would O
occasionally O
drop O
in O
mhm O
. O
because O
their O
daughter O
lives O
mhm O
. O
i O
think O
actually O
on O
the O
eastern O
part O
of O
the O
city O
. O

mhm O
. O

y- O

not O
in O
detroit B-GPE
but O
you O
know O

it O
's O
not O
warren B-GPE

sterling B-GPE
heights I-GPE

i O
do O
n't O
know O

something O
like O
that O
. O

w- O
yeah O
. O

yeah O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

oh O

so O
if O
he O
was O
going O
to O
visit O
her O
he O
would O
you O
know O
occasionally O
stop O
in O
here O
on O
his O
way O
home O
. O

sure O
. O

sure O
. O

but O
since O
he O
's O
been O
ill O
he O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
do O
that O
. O

i O
think O
i O
'm O
not O
sure O
whether O
linda B-PERSON
g- O
that O

their O
daughter O
is O
linda B-PERSON

yes O

yes O
. O

and O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
she O
got O
married O
or O
she O
's O
just O
been O
living O
with O
this O
man O
for O
a O
long O
while O

but O
they O
tell O
me O
he O
works O
at O
chrysler B-ORG

and O
he O
makes O
nice O
money O

and O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
very O
nice O
home O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O
you O
know O
. O

well O
that O
's O
good O
. O

yeah O

in O
an O
age O
of O
specialization O
, O
the O
federal O
judiciary O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
last O
bastions O
of O
the O
generalist O

a O

antitrust O
cases O
, O
from O
arson O
to O
securities O
fraud O
, O
without O
missing O
a O

but O
even O
on O
the O
federal O
bench O
, O
specialization O
is O
creeping O
in O
, O
and O
it O
has O
become O
a O
subject O
of O
sharp O
controversy O
on O
the O
newest O
federal O
appeals O
court O
. O

the B-ORG
court I-ORG
of I-ORG
appeals I-ORG
for I-ORG
the I-ORG
federal I-ORG
circuit I-ORG
was O
created O
in O
1982 B-DATE
to O
serve O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
as O
the O
court O
of O
last O
resort O
for O
most O
patent O
disputes O
. O

previously O
, O
patent O
cases O
moved O
through O
the O
court O
system O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
12 B-CARDINAL
circuit O
appeals O
courts O
. O

there O
, O
judges O
who O
saw O
few O
such O
cases O
and O
had O
no O
experience O
in O
the O
field O
grappled O
with O
some O
of O
the O
most O
technical O
and O
complex O
disputes O
imaginable O
. O

a O
new O
specialty O
court O
was O
sought O
by O
patent O
experts O
, O
who O
believed O
that O
the O
generalists O
had O
botched O
too O
many O
important O
, O
multimillion B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
dollar I-MONEY
cases O
. O

some O
patent O
lawyers O
had O
hoped O
that O
such O
a O
specialty O
court O
would O
be O
filled O
with O
experts O
in O
the O
field O
. O

but O
the O
reagan B-PERSON
administration O
thought O
otherwise O
, O
and O
so O
may O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
. O

since O
1984 B-DATE
, O
the O
president O
has O
filled O
four B-CARDINAL
vacancies O
in O
the O
federal B-ORG

with O
non-patent O
lawyers O

now B-DATE
only B-CARDINAL

that O
the O

michael B-PERSON

journey O
of O

is O
a O
work O

the O

what O

er O
, O
i O
, O
i O
think O
it O
is O
like O
this O
. O

first B-ORDINAL
, O
i O
think O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
wolves O
as O
%pw O
, O
description O
and O
appraisal O
, O
is O
, O
i O
think O
, O
a O
very O
good O
appraisal O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

because O
after O
the O
wolves O
have O
arrived O
-- O
it O
actually O
describes O
a O
so O
- O
called O
arrival O
of O
the O
wolves O
, O
which O
is O
also O
the O
arrival O
of O
powerful O
competitors O
, O
right O
. O

so O
i O
think O
this O
appraisal O
is O
still O
quite O
good O
. O

yeah O
. O

but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
um O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
uh O
, O
following O
our O
accession O
to O
the O
wto B-ORG
, O
we O
have O
been O
dancing O
with O
wolves O
. O

that O
is O
, O
since O
the O
wolves O
' O
arrival O
, O
uh O
, O
we O
have O
been O
actually O
adapting O
ourselves O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
wolves O
while O
dancing O
with O
them O
, O
as O
well O
as O
growing O
bigger O
and O
more O
powerful O
ourselves O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

because O
i O
find O
, O
um O
, O
this O
very O
, O
er O
, O
interesting O
, O
and O
it O
also O
just O
occurred O
to O
me O
, O
that O
, O
a O
, O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
we O
went O
to O
some O
chinese B-NORP
companies O
to O
do O
some O
surveys O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

for O
example O
, O
haier B-ORG
, O
when O
companies O
like O
haier B-ORG
, O
lenovo B-ORG
, O
and O
huawei B-ORG
go O
abroad O
, O
in O
fact O
others O
also O
see O
it O
as O
an O
arrival O
of O
chinese B-NORP
wolves O
, O
who O
are O
seen O
as O
immature O
yet O
equally O
capable O
of O
biting O
people O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O
this O
, O
uh O
, O
personally O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
arrival O
of O
, O
um O
, O
the O
wolves O
to O
be O
that O
horrible O
, O
though O
it O
is O
indeed O
wolf O

related O

meeting O

a B-DATE

of I-DATE

, O
my O

approached O
me O
to O

my O

saying O
he O
was O
meeting O
his O
parents O
at O
the O
airport O
. O

he O
also O
said O
both O
his O
wife O
and O
children O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

as O
his O
car O
was O
too O
small O
and O
mine O
was O
big O
, O
it O
could O
make O
his O
parents O
more O
comfortable O
. O

he O
added O
that O
he O
would O
only O
use O
it O
for O
one B-TIME
morning I-TIME
and O
would O
return O
it O
to O
me O
before O
noon B-TIME

although O
there O
was O
only O
a O
nodding O
acquaintance O
between O
the O
neighbor O
and O
me O
, O
we O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
apartment O
building O
after O
all O
and O
were O
both O
chinese B-NORP
. O

so O
i O
discussed O
with O
my O
wife O
back O
home O
and O
lent O
him O
the O
car O
as O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
not O
be O
using O
the O
car O
until O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O

and O
then O
something O
happened O
... O

at O
1:00pm B-TIME
, O
the O
neighbor O
called O
me O
, O
saying O
he O
took O
his O
parents O
to O
a O
buffet O
and O
would O
probably O
not O
to O
be O
back O
until O
around O
3:00pm B-TIME
. O

i O
of O
course O
agreed O
and O
asked O
them O
not O
to O
rush O
. O

this O
wait O
lasted O
till O
5:30pm B-TIME
, O
when O
the O
neighbor O
told O
me O
in O
a O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
crying O
tone O
that O
there O
was O
an O
accident O
, O
and O
everyone O
else O
was O
intact O
, O
except O
his O
father O
, O
who O
was O
in O
hospital O
for O
fractures O
. O

i O
comforted O
him O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
asked O
my O
friend O
to O
rush O
me O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

my O
neighbor O
showed O
me O
the O
police O
report O
at O
the O
hospital O
, O
which O
indicated O
it O
was O
all O
my O
neighbor O
's O
fault O
. O

he O
clashed O
into O
a O
truck O
going O
straight O
when O
he O
made O
a O
left O
turn O
. O

my O
car O
was O
completely O
damaged O
and O
had O
been O
towed O
away O
. O

i O
forced O
myself O
to O
refrain O
from O
the O
grief O
of O
loosing O
my O
beloved O
car O
-lrb- O
mine O
was O
liability O
- O
only O
coverage O
-rrb- O
and O
asked O
the O
friend O
to O
send O
their O
family O
home O
. O

and O
then O
the O
nightmare O
began O
. O

the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
my O
neighbor O
called O
me O
, O
saying O
his O
father O
needed O
to O
undergo O
an O
operation O
in O
hospital O
and O
asked O
where O
the O
money O
would O
come O
from O

i O
told O
him O
part O
would O
be O
covered O
by O
my O
car O
insurance O
. O

after O
a O
while O
, O
he O
called O
again O
, O
saying O
the O
operation O
charge O
was O
high O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
afford O

i O
tried O
my O
best O
to O
comfort O
him O
then O
and O
told O
him O
to O
think O
of O
a O
way O
slowly O

just O
then O
, O
a O
nearly O
crazy O
voice O
of O
a O
woman O
came O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
line O
, O
saying O
her O
family O
had O
just O
saved O
several B-MONEY
dozen I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
bucks I-MONEY
for O
the O
down O
payment O
of O
a O
house O
; O
where O
would O
they O
live O
afterwards O
if O
they O
spent O
this O
. O

she O
also O
said O
my O
car O
was O
a O
japanese B-NORP
one O
, O
which O
had O
poor O
safety O
performance O
and O
it O
was O
my O
car O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
car O
accident O
. O

she O
added O
that O
i O
should O
pay O
the O
money O
because O
the O
car O
was O
mine O
. O

i O
hung O
up O
the O
phone O
angrily O
as O
the O
dialog O
could O
not O
go O
on O
. O

my O
wife O
-lsb- O
pw% O
-rsb- O
had O
been O
persuading O
me O
aside O
, O
saying O
some O
women O
would O
easily O
lose O
mind O
once O
in O
fury O
. O

she O
asked O
me O
to O
take O
no O
heed O
of O
them O
and O
let O
them O
calm O
down O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

so O
i O
did O
n't O
take O
their O
words O
seriously O
but O
still O
felt O
angry O
. O

out O
of O
my O
expectation O
, O
a O
phone O
call O
on O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
day O
completely O
changed O
my O
original O
idea O
. O

the O
telephone O
rang O
just O
as O
i O
was O
about O
to O
go O
to O
work O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

i O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
sales O
call O
and O
was O
prepared O
to O
end O
it O
perfunctorily O
. O

unexpectedly O
, O
coming O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
line O
was O
a O
deep O
and O
resolute O
voice O
of O
a O
middle O
- O
aged O
man O
. O

he O
said O
in O
an O
incontestable O
tone O
that O
my O
neighbor O
had O
a O
car O
accident O
as O
a O
result O
of O
borrowing O
my O
car O
, O
which O
traumatized O
them O
both O
physically O
and O
mentally O
and O
harmed O
their O
economic O
interests O
, O
and O
as O
the O
car O
owner O
, O
they O
would O
not O
sue O
me O
if O
i O
compensated O
them O
for O
the O
hospital O
charge O
and O
the O
costs O
of O
missing O
work O
hours O
-lrb- O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
-rrb- O
, O
otherwise O
they O
would O
see O
me O
in O
court O
. O

he O
added O
that O
he O
was O
certain O
about O
the O
case O
as O
a O
lawyer O
in O
business O
for O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
the O
compensation O
he O
requested O
could O
double O
in O
court O
. O

as O
a O
great O
chinese B-NORP
guy O
, O
how O
could O
i O
be O
scared O
by O
a O
few O
remarks O
of O
the O
lawyer O
? O

i O
also O
took O
up O
the O
weapon O
of O
law O
for O
justice O
. O

of O
course O
, O
i O
also O
retained O
a O
lawyer O
. O

out O
of O
my O
expectation O
, O
my O
lawyer O
solved O
the O
problem O
by O
merely O
making O
two B-CARDINAL
phone O
calls O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
was O
to O
the O
police O
station O
, O
asking O
for O
any O
additional O
findings O
in O
the O
investigation O
report O
of O
the O
accident O
. O

there O
was O
additional O
findings O
unexpectedly O
, O
which O
were O
against O
them O
. O

someone O
at O
the O
junk O
yard O
found O
a O
bottle O
of O
unfinished O
wine O
without O
the O
lid O
inside O
the O
car O
and O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
police O
station O
. O

the O
police O
found O
they O
put O
the O
bottle O
of O
unfinished O
wine O
in O
the O
car O
without O
the O
lid O
after O
lunch O
. O

the O
second B-ORDINAL
call O
was O
to O
their O
lawyer O
. O

so O
their O
lawyer O
dropped O
the O
lawsuit O
. O

of O
course O
, O
they O
would O
not O
stop O
it O
there O
and O
came O
to O
discuss O
with O
me O
several O
times O
, O
sometimes O
honey O
- O
tongued O
and O
sometimes O
threatening O
. O

the O
most O
classic O
one O
was O
: O
do O
n't O
ever O
dream O
of O
living O
a O
life O
back O
to O
china B-GPE
, O
as O
we O
have O
people O
across O
the O
country O
. O

disgusting O
! O

here O
comes O
the O
old O
topic O
again O
, O
are O
you O
going O
to O
lend O
your O
car O
if O
your O
neighbor O
or O
friend O
asks O
. O

i O
think O
many O
people O
will O
say O
they O
wo O
n't O
. O

i O
would O
suggest O
not O
to O
lend O
online O
. O

however O
, O

saddam B-PERSON
's O
last B-ORDINAL
days O
and O
what O
is O
said O
he O
was O
like O

bu B-PERSON
thari I-PERSON

what O
we O
know O
about O
saddam B-PERSON
hussein I-PERSON
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
is O
that O
he O
had O
changed O
a O
lot O
. O

he O
had O
islamic B-NORP
tendecies O
and O
acts O
which O
many O
iraqis B-NORP
mentioned O
, O
saying O
that O
saddam B-PERSON
supported O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
the O
building O
of O
mosques O
centers O
for O
memorizing O
koran B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
charities O
, O
and O
the O
dancer O
's O
punishment O
was O
death O
. O

he O
had O
many O
works O
. O

but O
some O
explained O
his O
islamic B-PERSON
tendency O
by O
saying O
that O
he O
was O
currying O
favor O
with O
the O
sunnis B-NORP
as O
if O
they O
were O
reading O
his O
mind O
. O

i O
have O
followed O
saddam B-PERSON
hussein I-PERSON
, O
especially O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
i O
noticed O
about O
him O
was O
that O
there O
was O
religion O
but O
there O
was O
injustice O
and O
coarseness O
. O

and O
his O
punishment O
was O
unjust O
. O

i O
mean O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
dancer O
would O
be O
killed O
after O
second B-ORDINAL
offence O
. O

i O
did O
not O
expect O
anyone O
to O
kill O
the O
dancer O
unless O
good O
would O
come O
of O
it O
, O
but O
like O
the O
most O
idiots O
his O
aim O
was O
correct O
but O
the O
method O
was O
wrong O
. O

another O
example O
- O
after O
his O
son O
udai B-PERSON
harmed O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
people O
and O
attacked O
women O
and O
other O
matters O
, O
saddam B-PERSON
ordered O
him O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

and O
in O
fact O
he O
was O
fired O
on O
but O
survived O
miraculously O
, O
after O
being O
hit O
with O
several O
fatal O
shots O
some O
of O
which O
hit O
his O
spine O
. O

this O
is O
a O
sign O
that O
there O
was O
good O
in O
him O
otherwise O
he O
would O
not O
have O
ordered O
the O
killing O
of O
his O
son O
, O
his O
own O
child O
. O

but O
he O
was O
not O
a O
scholar O
nor O
feared O
in O
god O
. O

i O
myself O
heard O
from O
some O
people O
who O
were O
in O
iraq B-GPE
about O
the O
things O
that O
saddam B-PERSON
hussein I-PERSON
used O
to O
do O
, O
and O
could O
not O
be O
reasonably O
done O
by O
anyone O
other O
than O
a O
good O
moslem B-NORP
to O
the O
extent O
that O
many O
said O
of O
his O
actions O
that O
they O
were O
only O
to O
gain O
favor O
amongst O
the O
sunnis B-NORP
and O
the O
religious O
. O

but O
we O
judge O
by O
the O
appearances O
and O
his O
end O
was O
in O
line O
with O
the O
appearance O
. O

in O
his O
last B-ORDINAL
days O
during O
the O
fall O
of O
baghdad B-GPE
and O
his O
disappearance O
, O
an O
old O
woman O
or O
man O
said O
on O
tv O
on O
al B-ORG
- I-ORG
jazeera I-ORG
channel O
that O
he O
was O
hiding O
in O
her O
house O
and O
had O
had O
his O
prayer O
mat O
with O
him O
and O
was O
always O
praying O
and O
reading O
the O
koran B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

do O
we O
say O
no O
, O
this O
is O
hypocrisy O
? O

bear O
in O
mind O
that O
many O
have O
said O
that O
saddam B-PERSON
prayed O
regularly O
especially O
after O
he O
was O
put O
in O
prison O
by O
the O
rafida B-PERSON
and O
their O
masters O
. O

some O
of O
those O
who O
said O
that O
he O
was O
always O
praying O
and O
reading O
the O
koran B-WORK_OF_ART
are O
the O
christians B-NORP
who O
visited O
him O
in O
his O
prison O
cell O
. O

finally O
, O
during O
his O
hanging O
, O
the O
rafida B-PERSON
tried O
to O
distract O
him O
and O
keep O
him O
from O
saying O
the O
creed O
before O
his O
death O
. O

they O
were O
trying O
everything O
they O
could O
but O
we O
say O
that O
god O
made O
him O
steadfast O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
to O
see O
that O
he O
died O
acknowledging O
god O
. O

the O
rafida B-PERSON
were O
shouting O
provocative O
words O
such O
as O
muqtada B-PERSON
and O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
sadr I-PERSON
so O
that O
he O
would O
lose O
control O
and O
curse O
them O
, O
then O
they O
would O
have O
killed O
him O
. O

so O
they O
could O
show O
the O
clip O
in O
which O
there O
is O
cursing O
and O
insults O
from O
saddam B-PERSON
and O
cut O
the O
rest O
. O

however O
he O
remained O
steadfast O
in O
saying O
the O
creed O
and O
was O
killed O
whilst O
saying O
it O
. O

i O
believe O
that O
this O
could O
n't O
have O
happened O
without O
god O
making O
him O
steadfast O
otherwise O
god O
would O
not O
have O
made O
him O
steadfast O
in O
it O
. O

as O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
sheikhs O
says O
, O
many O
people O
when O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
say O
the O
creed O
and O
were O
being O
dictated O
the O
creed O
by O
those O
present O
would O
murmur O
" O
did O
love O
see O
drunkards O
? O
" O

other O
people O
say O
, O
i O
have O
not O
said O
it O
while O
i O
was O
alive O

you O
want O
me O
to O
say O
it O
when O
i O

dying O
... O
the O
truth O
is O
what O
is O
apparent O

but O
saddam B-PERSON
hussein I-PERSON
was O
reasonable O
in O
that O

repented O

he O

i O

that O

what O

i O

also O

that O

is O
the O

one O
used O

all O

on O
the O

issue O

how O
much O

enough O
- O
i O
find O
myself O
influenced O
by O
both O
sides O
' O
arguments O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O

but O
i O
guess O
what O
i O
can O
not O
understand O
is O
that O
all O
things O
being O
equal O
.. O
does O
n't O
population O
growth O
result O
in O
more O
tax O
revenues O
that O
would O
be O
allocated O
presumedly O
as O
they O
were O
before O
- O
in O
other O
words O
priorities O
remain O
the O
same O
in O
terms O
of O
allocations O
? O

if O
everyone O
- O
those O
already O
here O
plus O
our O
population O
growth O
is O
to O
pay O
higher O
taxes O
- O
should O
there O
be O
an O
expectation O
on O
the O
part O
of O
taxpayers O
to O
receive O
more O
services O
... O
and O
of O
course O
.... O
what O
about O
those O
that O
are O
opposed O
to O
the O
government O
providing O
services O
that O
private O
industry O
could O
do O
- O
for O
less O
. O

this O
certainly O
goes O
for O
transportation O
where O
we O
talk O
about O
a O
`` O
crisis O
'' O
that O
can O
only O
be O
solved O
by O
higher O

's O
what O
fitted O
in O
to O
that O
category O
because O
if O
you O
are O
a O
busy O
enough O
secretary O
you O
know O
%eh O
%mm O
. O
y- O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
bored O
because O
you O
are O
always O
doing O
something O
different O

and O
if O
your O
employer O
is O
a O
relatively O
decent O
human O
being O
you O
know O
two B-CARDINAL
if's O
there O

mhm O
. O

but O
you O
get O
no O
respect O

i O
mean O
oh O
you O
're O
a O
secretary O

and O
the O
pay O
is O
pretty O
pretty O
crummy O

it O
's O
about O
the O
well O
it O
's O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
as O
as O
what O
i O
'm O
getting O
you O
know O
but O
%um O
depending O
upon O
where O
you O
work O
and O
all O

but O
you O
know O
it O
's O
like O
that O
's O
no O
answer O
either O

so O
i O
've O
just O
been O
toying O
with O
this O
idea O
of O
going O
back O
to O
school O
and O
getting O
a O
computer O
science O
degree O
so O
i O
can O
always O
be O
gainfully O
employed O
. O

but O
anyway O
, O

a- O
and O
you O
can O
think O
about O
that O
pregnancy O
thing O

oh O
yeah O

that O
pregnancy O
thing O

yeah O

that O

do O
the O

maybe O
that O
's O
your O
there O
's O
your O
hormones O
calling O
. O

yeah O

well O
no O

the O
funny O
thing O
is O
it O
's O
like O
ten O
years O
ago O
i O
would O
've O
said O
oh O
yeah O
that O
was O
what O
i O
really O
wanted O
to O
be O
doing O
is O
having O
a O
baby O
you O
know O

but O
like O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
we O
're O
going O
to O
do O
it O
because O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
%uh O
%eh O
you O
know O
in B-DATE
the I-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
we O
'd O
regret O
it O
you O
know O

we O
we O
figure O
it O
's O
something O
we O
'd O
want O
to O
do O

it O
's O
not O
like O
we O
're O
doing O
it O
because O
we O
have O
to O
do O
it O
or O
there O
's O
peer O
pressure O

or O
well O
a O
little O
%mm O
little O
peer O
pressure O

oh O
no O
no O
no O

i O
yea- O
i O
know O
exactly O
where O
you O
're O
at O
because O
i O
think O
about O
that O
too O

i O
got O
about O
like O
six B-CARDINAL
or O
seven B-DATE
years I-DATE

i O
figure O
my O
body O
is O
a O
very O
slow O
%um O
yeah O
**maturer** O

you O
know O
what O
i O
mean O

like O
i O
did O
n't O
get O
my O
period O
until O
i O
was O
sixteen B-DATE

i O
do O
n't O
look O
yeah O
%mm O
e- O
i O
mean O
i O
look O
like O
about O
%uh O
%uh O
at O
least O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
younger O
than O
i O
actually O
am O

-- O
and O
i O
'm O
just O
starting O
to O
get O
my O
period O
actually O
now O
-- O
yeah O
yeah O
as O
an O
adult O
. O

so O
i O
kind O
of O
figure O
well O
i O
must O
i O
i O
'm O
probably O
i O
'm O
probably O
good O
until O
at O
least O
some O
time O
in O
the B-DATE
early I-DATE
forties I-DATE

and O
i O
could O
probably O
go O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
that O

i O
know O
there O
's O
a O
risk O
and O
all O
that O
bullshit O

yeah O
. O

but O
%um O
yeah O
i O
think O
about O
that O
too O
because O
it O
's O
like O
i O
mean O
i O
i O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
way O
things O
are O
going O
in O
the O
in O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
responsibility O
. O

i O
know O

well O
i O
mean O
that O
's O
the O
thing O

kids O
are O
cute O
and O
all O
that O

and O
i O
was O
just O
we O
we O
%mm O
slept O
until O
noon B-TIME

we O
got O
up O
about B-TIME
ten I-TIME
and O
was O
like O
oh O
we O
have O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
played O
with O
the O
cats O
fell O
back O
to O
sleep O

okay O
i O
mean O
we O
're O
talking O
total O
slackers O

%mm O

and O
i O
thought O
gee O
you O
know O
if O
we O
had O
a O
kid O
w- O
we O
could O
n't O
do O
this O
you O
know O

and O

%mm O

no O

you O
got O
to O
be O
focused O
on O
that O

and O
i O
wa- O
i O
mean O
there O
's O
a O
lots O
of O
other O
things O
that O

i O
mean O
as O
far O
as O
like O
living O
situation O
i O
i O
was O
feeling O
kind O
of O
settled O
you O
know O
like O
-- O
right O
. O
i O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
be O
like O
traipsing O
around O

but O
i O
mean O
i O
could O
say O
that O
for O
the O
next O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
even O
eight B-CARDINAL
or O
maybe O
-- O
y- O
yeah O
. O

even O
if O
i O
could O
project O
that O
far O

got O
a O

you O
ca O
n't O
do O
fucking O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
w- O
-- O

i O
know O

like O

off O
to O
the O
orient B-LOC
and O
start O
like O
bouncing O
from O

country O
. O

he O
could O
get O
a O
position O
overseas O

which O
is O
something O
both O

it O
was O
n't O
so O
much O
an O
adjustment O
to O
the O
way O

it O
's O
just O
asking O

to O
yeah O
. O
i O
mean O
you O
have O
to O
like O

at O
like O
both O
ad- O
i O
mean O
they O
both O
have O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O

what O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
concentrate O
on O
the O
advantages O
in O
what O
oth- O
ever O
place O
you O
're O
in O
-- O
mhm O
-- O
and O
think O
about O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
the O
place O
that O
you O
're O
not O
in O
. O

yeah O

otherwise O
you O
go O
nuts O
right O
? O

that O
's O
true O
, O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
know O
laura B-PERSON
tried O
to O

%uh O
because O
we O
have O
email O
and O
and O
so O
she O
sent O
me O
a O
letter O
back O
saying O
you O
know O
remember O
how O
crowded O
the O
transportation O
is O
and O
%uh O
what O
else O
-- O
%mm O
. O
how O
expensive O
everything O
is O

and O
%uh O
i- O
you O
know O
i O
remember O
those O
things O
of O
course O
you O
know O
-- O

and O
you O
work O
you O
know O
possibilities O
were O
a O
lot O
more O
limited O

true O
. O

and O
the O
language O
you O
know O
yeah O
. O
constantly O
like O
kind O
of O

like O
i O
mean O
those O
could O
be O
p- O
considered O
positive O
things O
as O
well O

yeah O

but O
i O
mean O
you O
mind O
as O
well O
think O
of O
them O
in O
a O
negative O
vie- O
rather O
than O

mhm O
sure O

they O
just O
like O
worrying O
over O
them O
. O

well O
you O
know O
and O
that O
's O
why O
i O
'm O
i O
i O
it O
helps O
to O
have O
kind O
of O
a O
glimpse O
into O
the O
future O
right O
? O

and O
that O
's O
how O
that O
's O
how O
we O
got O
to O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
spain B-GPE
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
is O
we O
said O
we O
wanted O
to O
live O
abroad O
and O
we O
would O
try O
to O
do O
it O
you O
know O
as O
teachers O

and O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
way O
because O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
we O
had O
this O
idea O
of O

and O
i O
i O
really O
feel O
that O
that O
's O
important O

and O
so O
what O
i O
'm O
having O
an O
idea O
of O
now O
is O

okay O
you O
know O
emory B-PERSON
works O
on O
his O
doctorate O

it O
takes O
about O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE

we O
have O
the O
kid O
probably O

we O
he O
gets O
a O
research O
position O
somewhere O
in O
france B-GPE
or O
in O
spain B-GPE
%um O

and O
then O
we O
move O
over O
there O

and O
you O
know O
i O
take O
care O
of O
the O
kid O
and O
and O
do O
some O
you O
know O
little O
day O
labor O
whatever O
you O
know O

we O
'll O
see O

%mm O
. O

%um O
and O
we O
have O
relatively O
mellow O
life O
for O
who O
knows O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE

and O
then O
we O
take O
it O
from O
there O
. O

yeah O

because O
even O
like O
you O
know O
i O
mean O
all O
that O
stuff O
right O
is O
is O
all O
so O
subject O
to O
whatever O
change O
in O
the O
weather O
that O
happens O
to O
be O
right O
? O

mhm O
. O

oh O
i O
know O

i O
know O

and O
and O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
what O
i O
think O
because O
i O
get O
like O
the O
same O
i O
get O
the O
same O
as O
you O

like O
some O
days O
it O
's O
just O
kind O
of O
like O
you O
know O
what O
the O
hell O
am O
i O
doing O
not O
not O
with O
my O
life O
but O
ge- O

but O
i O
mean O
just O
what O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O
like O
what O
like O
where O
do O
i O
get O
the O
animal O
to O
to O
just O
you O
know O
to O
do O
anything O
you O
know O

i O
just O
lay O
in O
bed O
and O
dream O
for O
for O
the O
whole O
day O
easily O

yeah O

i O
know O
. O

well O
i O
i O
know O

i O
know O
what O
you O
're O
saying O

i O
i O
feel O
there O
's O
sort O
of O
a O
a O
line O
to O
cross O
too O
between O
really O
planning O
it O
out O
and O
worry O
and O
stressing O
over O
it O
because O
for O
a O
while O
a O
couple O
months O
back O
there O
i O
was O
thinking O
in O
terms O
of O
oh O
gosh O
you O
know O
can O
we O
ever O
afford O
a O
house O

%mm O
. O

and O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
sort O
of O
looked O
at O
it O
financially O
and O
said O
is O
this O
what O
we O
really O
want O
to O
be O
worrying O
about O
right O
now O

and O
you O
know O
i O
realize O
no O

yeah O
absolutely O
. O

and O
and O
so O
you O
know O
you O
can O
sort O
of O
focus O
too O
much O
on O
the O
future O

or O
i O
i O
know O
i O
have O
this O
tendency O
to O
do O
that O
. O

and O
miss O
the O
present O
completely O

i O
mean O
miss O
like O
you O
know O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
goddamn O
onions O
frying O
in O
the O
pan O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O
and O
e- O
each O
little O

i O
mean O
i- O
it O
's O
like O
as O
far O
as O
i O
'm O
concerned O
there O
's O
like O
no O
pleasure O
that O
's O
as O
intense O
as O
the O
one O
that O
you O
are O
experiencing O
at O
that O
moment O
you O
know O

you O
can O
think O
about O
what O
something O
might O
be O
like O
or O
reminisce O
about O
the O
past O

but O
like O
when O
you O
're O
there O
in O
that O
moment O
it O
's O

i O
mean O
everything O
else O
just O
kind O
of O
like O

it O
's O
almost O
like O
time O
does O
n't O
exist O
. O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O

yeah O

well O
i O
i O
know O
one O
of O
the O
best O
moments O
i O
can O
recall O
in O
these B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
months I-DATE
is O

okay O
i O
get O
the O
late O
i O
get O
to O
work O
a O
little O
bit O
late O
which O
is O
common O

and O

do O
n't O
really O
care O
since O
i O
'm O

have O
to O
be O

for O
a O
minute O
and O

to O
the O
birds O

and O
that O
's O
that O
it O
sort O
of O
cheers O
me O
up O

i O
you O
know O

n't O
even O

%eh O
%um O
i O
will O
be O
for O
the O
next B-TIME

hours I-TIME
or O
so O

but O
out O
here O
there O
still O
is O
some O
life O
going O
on O

and O
just O
sort O
of O
cheers O
me O
up O
to O
know O
that O

okay O

i O
can O
come O
back O
to O
it O
you O
know O

so O
that O
's O
that O
's O

yeah O

in O
that O
moment O
i O
mean O
nobody O
is O

verdict O
, O
or O
to O
proceed O
in O
the O
context O
of O
the O
different O
viewpoint O
of O
the O
defense O
. O

there O
is O
total O
respect O
for O
and O
confidence O
in O
the O
verdicts O
of O
the O
judiciary O
. O

but O
what O
i O
would O
like O
to O
refer O
to O
in O
connection O
with O
this O
issue O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
necessity O
of O
educating O
people O
about O
equality O
of O
lineage O
in O
marriage O
before O
one O
finds O
oneself O
involved O
in O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
that O
of O
fatima B-PERSON
and O
mansour B-PERSON
. O

there O
is O
a O
large O
portion O
of O
people O
who O
get O
married O
without O
keeping O
in O
mind O
- O
out O
of O
ignorance O
- O
this O
issue O
, O
which O
can O
threaten O
their O
family O
life O
at O
any O
moment O
when O
a O
member O
of O
the O
wife O
's O
family O
objects O
to O
the O
lineage O
of O
the O
husband O
. O

i O
declare O
that O
i O
have O
attended O
many O
marriage O
ceremonies O
during O
my O
lifetime O
. O

but O
i O
do O
not O
remember O
even O
one B-CARDINAL
marriage O
official O
who O
brought O
up O
this O
issue O
by O
asking O
the O
groom O
about O
his O
lineage O
before O
finalizing O
the O
contract O
. O

he O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
so O
as O
long O
as O
this O
issue O
has O
such O
a O
level O
of O
consideration O
. O

it O
can O
threaten O
the O
family O
life O
of O
the O
bride O
and O
groom O
at O
any O
future O
moment O
. O

therefore O
, O
the O
educational O
and O
religious O
institutions O
in O
the O
country O
are O
obliged O
socially O
to O
educate O
the O
society O
in O
a O
more O
profound O
way O
. O

there O
is O
no O
stronger O
evidence O
of O
the O
ignorance O
by O
a O
large O
sector O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
separation O
because O
of O
inequality O
in O
lineage O
than O
the O
social O
debate O
stirred O
up O
by O
this O
issue O
, O
which O
was O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
common O
people O
but O
extended O
to O
writers O
, O
cultured O
people O
, O
and O
lawyers O
, O
foremost O
among O
them O
the O
defense O
lawyer O
who O
issued O
a O
statement O
after O
the O
verdict O
was O
issued O
by O
the B-ORG
court I-ORG
of I-ORG
appeals I-ORG
expressing O
that O
he O
would O
continue O
to O
stick O
to O
his O
position O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
verdict O
that O
was O
issued O
. O

maybe O
it O
is O
also O
the O
duty O
of O
our O
media O
institutions O
which O
presented O
this O
case O
to O
the O
public O
opinion O
by O
following O
the O
verdict O
issued O
by O
the B-ORG

with O
intensive O
interviews O
with O
a O
number O
of O
jurists O
and O

concerning O
this O
and O
other O
issues O
. O

this O
case O
revealed O
that O
there O
are O
many O
things O
that O
we O
lack O
knowledge O
about O
as O
a O

before O

-- O
some O
thoughts O
on O
the O
attitude O
of O
benign O

towards O
social O
reform O
. O

a O
glance O
at O
the O
title O
, O
people O
with O
a O
little O
political O
sensitivity O
may O
roughly O
understand O
the O
core O
topic O
of O
this O
article O
: O
the O
rule O
of O
benign O
interaction O
between O
planned O
economy O
and O
market O
economy O
, O
and O
between O
public O
ownership O
and O
private O
ownership O
-- O
because O
only O
their O
relationships O
are O
those O
between O
a O
father O
and O
a O
son O
, O
and O
it O
is O
only O
between O
them O
are O
there O
different O
conflicts O
involving O
" O
human O
relations O
, O
" O
" O
rules O
" O
and O
" O
science O
, O
" O
as O
well O
as O
bloody O
wrestling O
between O
classes O
, O
factions O
and O
individuals O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
morality O
and O
interests O
. O

comparing O
planned O
economy O
and O
public O
ownership O
to O
a O
father O
is O
tantamount O
to O
comparing O
market O
economy O
and O
private O
ownership O
to O
a O
son O
, O
which O
holds O
water O
principally O
and O
historically O
no O
matter O
you O
put O
it O
this O
way O
or O
another O
. O

this O
is O
because O
the O
former O
two B-CARDINAL
given O
" O
fatherhood O
" O
are O
indeed O
the O
most O
essential O
factors O
of O
the O
national O
character O
and O
institution O
of O
the O
socialist B-NORP
new O
china B-GPE
, O
while O
the O
latter O
two O
dubbed O
" O
son O
" O
in O
this O
article O
-- O
are O
indeed O
the O
ideological O
outcomes O
derived O
after O
the O
death O
of O
china B-GPE
's O
founder O
comrade O
mao B-PERSON
zedong I-PERSON
under O
tremendous O
international O
and O
domestic O
political O
pressures O
on O
planned O
economy O
and O
public O
ownership O
, O
which O
grew O
into O
today B-DATE
's O
para-system O
after O
about O
30 B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
reform O
and O
opening O
up O
. O

regarding O
this O
, O
the O
factual O
development O
process O
of O
political O
civilization O
that O
the O
marxist B-NORP
ideology O
has O
been O
increasingly O
marginalized O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
or O
so O
is O
a O
strong O
evidence O
. O

by O
sorting O
out O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
above O
historical O
background O
and O
conceptual O
relationships O
, O
we O
will O
have O
a O
pretty O
thorough O
, O
comprehensive O
and O
systematic O
knowledge O
framework O
about O
the O
benign O
inevitable O
trends O
and O
development O
guidelines O
of O
the O
future O
society O
dependent O
on O
the O
rule O
of O
society O
, O
so O
that O
the O
associated O
impression O
captured O
may O
be O
more O
concrete O
. O

regarding O
this O
, O
my O
standpoint O
is O
: O
because O
the O
socialism O
underpinned O
by O
planned O
economy O
, O
public O
ownership O
and O
the O
people O
's O
democratic O
dictatorship O
is O
indeed O
a O
really O
" O
fresh O
" O
systemic O
thing O
for O
china B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
mid I-DATE
and I-DATE
late I-DATE
20th I-DATE
century I-DATE
-- O
without O
a O
model O
or O
sufficient O
experience O
or O
theories O
to O
refer O
to O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
scientific O
its O
kernel O
is O
, O
it O
is O
hard O
not O
to O
have O
certain O
superficial O
and O
local O
problems O
. O

however O
, O
this O
should O
not O
provide O
an O
excuse O
to O
overthrow O
it O
by O
fair O
means O
or O
foul O
, O
as O
he O
is O
our O
father O
and O
the O
common O
choice O
of O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
laboring O
people O
. O

the O
fact O
that O
it O
" O
finally O
became O
our O
national O
character O
and O
main O
system O
after O
over O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
century I-DATE
of O
international O
and O
domestic O
political O
transformation O
" O
is O
a O
stronger O
proof O
that O
it O
is O
the O
milestone O
for O
a O
new O
civilization O
resulted O
from O
the O
blood O
and O
sweat O
of O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
proletarian O
revolutionary O
martyrs O
. O

therefore O
, O
no O
matter O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
average O
citizens O
or O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
the O
founder O
of O
the O
new O
government O
, O
we O
should O
respect O
and O
develop O
her O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
inheritance O
, O
innovation O
and O
improvement O
. O

is O
my O
opinion O
above O
correct O
? O

i O
believe O
you O
will O
naturally O
obtain O
a O
relatively O
fair O
and O
just O
conclusion O
if O
you O
could O
understand O
and O
treat O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
" O
father O
" O
system O
and O
" O
son O
" O
system O
with O
impartiality O
and O
sufficient O
goodwill O
. O

for O
example O
, O
based O
on O
the O
existing O
institutional O
cultural O
heritage O
in O
the O
human O
history O
, O
we O
could O
see O
: O
the O
" O
father O
" O
system O
mentioned O
herein O
has O
the O
majority O
in O
mind O
or O
it O
is O
established O
in O
the O
fundamental O
and O
long O
- O
term O
interests O
of O
the O
majority O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
need O
for O
sustainable O
and O
sound O
development O
of O
the O
country O
, O
the O
nation O
, O
and O
the O
overall O
society O
-- O
while O
the O
" O
son O
" O
system O
mentioned O
herein O
is O
ignorant O
and O
sick O
in O
the O
company O
of O
such O
behavioral O
characteristics O
as O
exploitation O
, O
fraudulence O
, O
pernicious O
influence O
and O
robbery O
. O

so O
, O
we O
can O
not O
urge O
the O
son O
to O
throttle O
the O
essentially O
healthy O
and O
scientific O
" O
father O
" O
system O
by O
fair O
mean O
or O
foul O
without O
considering O
the O
consequences O
, O
because O
there O
are O
problems O
in O
its O
practice O
and O
development O
-- O
such O
as O
state O
monopoly O
for O
purchases O
and O
sales O
, O
lower O
efficiency O
due O
to O
centralized O
management O
, O
and O
inhibition O
of O
the O
will O
of O
productivity O
by O
undue O
political O
pressure O
resulting O
from O
class O
struggles O
during O
the O
new O
deal O
. O

it O
is O
because O
that O
will O
not O
only O
make O
the O
society O
increasingly O
ignorant O
and O
sick O
as O
it O
violates O
the O
rule O
of O
benign O
social O
development O
, O
distorts O
normal O
" O
human O
relations O

and O
the O
ethic O
and O
prevalent O
value O
and O
the O
rule O
of O

update O
rooted O

, O
but O
the O
humanity O
will O
retrogress O
as O
people O

thoughts O
and O
behaviors O
become O
increasingly O
ridiculous O
. O

yes O
, O
this O
is O
the O
case O
. O

my O
opinion O
above O
is O
not O
absurd O
and O
delusive O
at O
all O
, O
because O
this O
is O
true O
not O
only O
in O

but O
also O

the O

the O

is O
extremely O
important O
to O

for O
a O
couple O
of O
reasons O
. O

firstly B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
enables O

share O

. O

people O
can O
see O
that O
they O
are O
not O

in O

and O
that O
they O

from O
a O
collective O
standpoint O
instead O
of O
chasing O
after O
individual O
problems O
one B-CARDINAL
at O
a O
time O
. O

secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O

need O
information O
from O
the O
outside O

, O
and O
now O
that O
the O

have O
shifted O
their O
attention O
to O
other O
matters O
, O
the O
local O
people O
need O
an O
avenue O
by O
which O
to O
get O
their O
message O
out O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

the O

is O
just O
the O
thing O
to O
accomplish O
these O
objectives O
. O

this O
newsletter O
has O
also O
helped O
to O
spur O
increased O

on O

what O
to O
do O
? O

first B-ORDINAL
, O
generalize O
. O

shorn O
of O
all O
their O
riders O
, O
special O
provisions O
, O
and O
other O
bells O
and O
whistles O
, O
insurance O
policies O
can O
still O
be O
grouped O
under O
two B-CARDINAL
broad O
categories O
: O
so O
- O
called O
pure O
insurance O
, O
which O
amasses O
no O
cash O
value O
in O
the O
policy O
and O
pays O
off O
only O
upon O
death O
, O
and O
permanent O
insurance O
, O
which O
provides O
not O
only O
a O
death O
benefit O
but O
also O
a O
cash O
value O
in O
the O
policy O
that O
can O
be O
used O
in O
various O
ways O
while O
the O
insured O
is O
still O
alive O
. O

if O
all O
you O
want O
is O
death O
- O
benefit O
coverage O
, O
pure O
insurance O
-- O
a O
term O
policy O
-- O
gives O
you O
maximum O
bang O
for O
your O
buck O
, O
within O
limits O
. O

it O
's O
much O
cheaper O
than O
permanent O
insurance O
bought O
at O
the O
same O
age O
. O

but O
`` O
term O
'' O
means O
just O
that O
; O
the O
policy O
is O
written O
for O
a O
specific O
time O
period O
only O
and O
must O
be O
renewed O
when O
it O
expires O
. O

it O
may O
also O
stipulate O
that O
the O
insured O
must O
pass O
another O
medical O
exam O
before O
renewal O
; O
if O
you O
flunk O
-- O
which O
means O
you O
need O
insurance O
more O
than O
ever O
-- O
you O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

even O
if O
you O
're O
healthy O
and O
can O
renew O
, O
your O
premium O
will O
go O
up O
sharply O
because O
you O
're O
that O
much O
older O
. O

so O
term O
insurance O
may O
not O
be O
as O
cheap O
as O
it O
looks O
. O

there O
are O
all O
sorts O
of O
variations O
on O
term O
insurance O
: O
policies O
structured O
to O
pay O
off O
your O
mortgage O
debt O
, O
term O
riders O
tacked O
on O
to O
permanent O
insurance O
, O
and O
many O
others O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
variation O
that O
appealed O
to O
me O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
the O
`` O
money O
smart O

policy O
offered O
by O

. O

upon O
examination O
, O
however O
, O
i O
wondered O
whether O
the O
plan O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
. O

amex B-ORG
said O
it O
would O
charge O
me O
$ O
576 B-MONEY
a O
year O
for O
$ O
100,000 B-MONEY
of O
coverage O
-- O
and O
would O
pay O
me O
back O
all O
the O
premiums O
i O
put O
in O
if O
i O
canceled O
the O
policy O
after O
10 B-DATE

sounds O
great O
-- O
or O
does O
it O
? O

first B-ORDINAL
, O
if O
i O
canceled O
, O
i O
'd O
have O
no O
more O
insurance O
, O
a O
not O
insignificant O
consideration O
. O

second B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
$ O
5,760 B-MONEY
i O
'd O
get O
back O
would O
be O
much O
diminished O

by O
10 B-DATE

of O

; O
amex B-ORG
, O
not O
i O
, O
would O
get O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O

income O
on O
my O
money O
, O
income O
that O
would O
have O
exceeded O
the O
inflation O
rate O
and O
thus O
given O
the O
company O
a O
real O
profit O
. O

third B-ORDINAL
and O
most O
important O
, O
amex O
would O
charge O
me O
a O
far O
higher O
premium O
than O
other O
reputable O
companies O
would O
on O
a O
straight O
term O
policy O
for O
the O
same O
amount O
; O
i O
'd O
be O
paying O
so O
heavily O
just O
to O
have O
the O
option O
of O
getting O
my O
premiums O
back O
that O
i O
'd O
almost O
have O
to O
cancel O
to O
make O
the O
whole O
thing O
worthwhile O
. O

that O
would O
be O
all O
right O
with O
amex B-ORG
, O
which O
could O
then O
lock O
in O
its O
investment O
profit O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
add O
up O
to O
a O
`` O
smart O
money O
'' O
move O
for O
me O
. O

which O
goes O
to O
show O
that O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
law O
applies O
in O
insurance O
as O
in O
anything O
else O
: O
there O
is O
no O
free O
lunch O
, O
there O
is O
only O
marketing O
. O

and O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
law O
, O
unique O
to O
insurance O
? O

if O
i O
die O
early O
, O
i O
win O
-- O
a O
hollow O
victory O
, O
since O
i O
ca O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
-- O
and O
if O
i O
live O
long O
, O
the O
insurer O
wins O
. O

always O
. O

this O
is O
worth O
remembering O
when O
insurers O
and O
their O
salesmen O
try O
to O
sell O
you O
permanent O
insurance O
, O
the O
kind O
that O
amasses O
cash O
value O
. O

the O
word O
`` O
death O
'' O
can O
not O
be O
escaped O
entirely O
by O
the O
industry O
, O
but O
salesmen O
dodge O
it O
wherever O
possible O
or O
cloak O
it O
in O
euphemisms O
, O
preferring O
to O
talk O
about O
`` O
savings O
'' O
and O
`` O
investment O
'' O
instead O
. O

the O
implication O
is O
that O
your O
permanent O
- O
insurance O
policy O
is O
really O
some O
kind O
of O
cd O
or O
mutual O
- O
fund O
account O
with O
an O
added O
feature O
. O

that O
is O
gilding O
the O
lily O
. O

the O
fact O
is O
that O
as O
a O
savings O
or O
investment O
vehicle O
, O
insurance O
generally O
runs O
a O
poor O
second B-ORDINAL
to O
any O
direct O
investment O
you O
might O
make O
in O
the O
same O
things O
the O
insurance O
company O
is O
putting O
your O
money O
into O
. O

that O
's O
because O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
insurance O
portion O
of O
the O
policy O
and O
the O
effort O
required O
to O
sell O
and O
service O
the O
whole O
package O
. O

again O
, O
no O
free O
lunch O
. O

this O
is O

in O

some O
of O
the O
assumptions O
built O

the O

of O

that O
show O
me O
the O

of O
my O

over O
the B-DATE

they O
commonly O
give O
two B-CARDINAL
scenarios O
: O
one B-CARDINAL
is O
based O
on O
interest O
rates O
that O
the O
company O
guarantees O
-lrb- O
usually O
4 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
to I-PERCENT
4.5 I-PERCENT

-rrb- O
and O
the O
other O
on O
the O
rate O
it O
is O
currently O
getting O

, O
often O
8.5 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
or O
more O
. O

projecting O
the O
latter O
over O
several B-DATE
decades I-DATE
, O
i O
find O
my O
cash O
buildup O
is O
impressive O
-- O
but O
can O
any O
high O
interest O
rate O
prevail O
for O
that O
long O
? O

not O
likely O
, O
i O
think O
. O

also O
, O
some O
policy O
illustrations O
assume O
that O
mortality O
costs O
will O
decline O
or O
that O
i O
will O
get O
some O
sort O
of O
dividend O
bonus O
after O
the B-DATE
10th I-DATE

these O

, O
premiums O

can O
be O
structured O
to O
`` O

'' O
after O

only O

the O

if O

, O
the O

may O
be O
knocking O

asking O
for O
steeper O
premium O
payments O
to O
maintain O

i O
do O

some O

`` O

their O
first B-ORDINAL

was O
a O

back O
in O

put O

when O

both O
the O

noting O
that O

often O
cracked O

yeh B-PERSON
then O
came O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
replacing O

his O
factory O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
in O
the O

to O
produce O

yeh B-PERSON
also O
made O
the O

both O
lines O
proved O

very O
profitable O

in O

in O
this O
period O

who O
was O
a O

into O
the O

yeh B-PERSON
recalls O
a O
" O
beautiful O
accident O
" O
: O
he O
bought O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
- O
hand O
electroplater O
from O
a O
japanese B-NORP
and O
tried O
to O
plate O
various O
plastic O

so O
as O
to O
make O
them O
more O
resilient O
. O

only O
after O
repeated O
failures O

much O
frustration O
did O
he O
think O
about O
electroplating O
his O
black O
plastic O
albums O
with O
nickel O
and O
copper O
to O
make O
them O
stronger O
. O

this O
thrust O
him O
into O

" O
the O
times O
change O

with O

" O
says O

he O
explains O
that O
it O
took O
100 B-DATE

after O

resilient O

, O
he O
never O
recoils O
from O
challenges O

back O
when O
cds O
were O
still O
in O
their O
infancy O
, O
yeh B-PERSON
relied O
on O
his O
old O
relationship O
with O
sony B-ORG
and O
found O
a O
team O
of O
engineers O
associated O
with O
the B-ORG
industrial I-ORG
technology I-ORG

institute I-ORG
before O
he O
made O
a O
push O
into O
cd O

. O

starting O
from O
simple O
pieces O
of O
compressed O
plastic O
, O
they O
went O
one B-CARDINAL
step O
at O
a O
time O
, O
building O
a O
sturdy O
foundation O
of O
technical O
knowledge O
that O
ritek B-ORG
still O
enjoys O
today B-DATE
. O

in O
1990 B-DATE
ritek B-ORG
started O
to O
press O
cds O
, O
becoming O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
mass O
- O
production O
manufacturer O
of O
cds O
in O
taiwan B-GPE
. O

back O
then O
, O
it O
cost O
japanese B-NORP
manufacturers O
about O
nt$ O
80 B-MONEY
to O
press O
one O
cd O
. O

ritek B-ORG
garnered O
market O
share O
by O
undercutting O
the O
competition O
and O
charging O
only O
nt$ B-MONEY
50 I-MONEY
. O

with O
the O
support O
that O
yeh B-PERSON
had O
long O
enjoyed O
in O
the O
recording O
industry O
here O
, O
ritek B-ORG
was O
easily O
able O
to O
market O
its O
goods O
. O

what O
really O
brought O
ritek B-ORG
into O
the O
realm O
of O
high O
- O
technology O
was O
developing O
its O
own O
cd O
- O
rs O
-lrb- O
recordable O
cds O
-rrb- O
. O

taking O
a O
different O
tack O
from O
the O
japanese B-NORP
, O
who O
were O
plating O
cd O
- O
rs O
with O
a O
thin O
gold O
layer O
, O
ritek B-ORG
instead O
developed O
a O
cheap O
and O
high O
- O
quality O
process O
for O
coating O
them O
with O
silver O
or O
aluminum O
. O

these O
allowed O
for O
a O
much O
lower O
price O
that O
in O
turn O
created O
more O
demand O
. O

it O
is O
yet O
another O
example O
of O
a O
taiwanese B-NORP
company O
starting O
a O
global O
price O
war O
. O

marching O
forward O

being O
competitive O
in O
terms O
of O
price O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
ritek B-ORG
's O
strong O
points O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
the O
whole O
story O
behind O
the O
company O
's O
success O
. O

another O
important O
factor O
is O
that O
at O
key O
moments O
yeh B-PERSON
has O
not O
hesitated O
to O
invest O
the O
necessary O
sums O
when O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
bring O
the O
technology O
to O
the O
next O
level O
. O

" O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
when O
we O
first B-ORDINAL
started O
producing O
cds O
, O
one O
machine O
required O
five B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
persons O
to O
operate O
, O
" O
yeh B-PERSON
recalls O
. O

" O
when O
a O
flood O
of O
orders O
came O
in O
, O
we O
'd O
have O
everyone O
working O
overtime O
with O
shifts O
going O
around O
the O
clock O
, O
but O
we O
still O
were O
n't O
able O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
demand O
. O

that O
's O
when O
the O
workers O
took O
the O
initiative O
to O
suggest O
that O
we O
automate O
. O
" O

now O
everything O
from O
ordering O
and O
production O
to O
storage O
and O
shipping O
is O
computerized O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
person O
is O
typically O
responsible O
for O
about B-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
machines O
. O

the O
whole O
process O
has O
been O
shortened O
, O
and O
quality O
is O
high O
. O

the O
amount O
that O
the O
same O
3,000 B-CARDINAL
workers O
can O
produce O
has O
exploded O
from O
200,000 B-CARDINAL
a O
month O
to O
200 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
a O
month O
. O

automation O
has O
meant O
that O
the O
workers O
have O
had O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
operate O
sophisticated O
machinery O
and O
computers O
, O
so O
that O
ritek B-ORG
has O
advanced O
out O
of O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
traditional O
plastic O
disc O
pressers O
. O

automation O
has O
also O
allowed O
the O
company O
to O
lower O
costs O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
price O
of O
data O
storage O
media O
has O
been O
plummeting O
. O

in O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
quarter I-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
the O
price O
of O
a O
cd O
- O
rom O
suddenly O
fell O
from O
60 B-MONEY
us I-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
to O
40 B-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
, O
which O
is O
n't O
far O
from O
the B-MONEY
30 I-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
it O
costs O
to O
make O
. O

it O
's O
a O
long O
way O
from O
the O
us$ O
14 B-MONEY
that O
they O
cost O
when O
they O
first B-ORDINAL
hit O
the O
market O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE

. O

yet O
ritek B-ORG
has O
still O
managed O
to O
maintain O
operating O
profits O
of O
22 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
and O
the O
falling O
prices O
have O
n't O
crushed O
it O
. O

the O
coming O
wave O
of O

will O
focus O
on O
light O
and O
small O
portable O
data O
devices O
such O
as O
pdas O
and O
mp3 O
players O
, O
so O
the O
challenge O
for O
ritek B-ORG
is O
allowing O
devices O
that O
are O
becoming O
smaller O
and O
smaller O
to O
have O
larger O
data O
capacities O
and O
higher O
fidelity O
. O

yeh B-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
the O
patent O
rights O
for O

are O
owned O
entirely O
by O

japanese B-NORP
companies O

it O

, O
a O

to O
her O
many O

. O

to O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
, O
the O
case O
is O
a O
puzzle O
. O

it O
is O
what O
lawyers O
call O
`` O
fact O
intensive O
. O
'' O

it O
presents O
no O
great O
issue O
of O
legal O
principle O
, O
no O
overriding O
question O
of O
family O
law O
or O
the O
law O
of O
contempt O
. O

instead O
, O
it O
turns O
on O
the O
disputed O
and O
elusive O
facts O
of O
`` O
who O
did O
what O
to O
whom O
. O
'' O

it O
is O
difficult O
, O
if O
not O
impossible O
, O
for O
anyone O
who O
has O
not O
pored O
over O
the O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
pages O
of O

pleadings O
and O

to O
have O
a O
worthwhile O
opinion O
on O
the O
underlying O
merits O
of O
the O
controversy O
. O

certainly O
i O
do O
not O
. O

so O
we O
must O
look O
elsewhere O
for O
an O
explanation O
of O
the O
unusual O
power O
this O
case O
has O
exerted O
over O
the O
minds O
of O
many O
, O
not O
just O
in O
washington B-GPE
but O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
country O
and O
even O
the O
world O
. O

i O
suggest O
that O
three B-CARDINAL
themes O
have O
come O
together O
in O
the O
strange O
case O
of O
dr. O
morgan B-PERSON
. O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
that O
it O
represents O
an O
intense O
battle O
in O
what O
james B-PERSON
thurber I-PERSON
used O
to O
caricature O
as O
`` O
the O
war O
between O
the O
sexes O
. O
'' O

but O
although O
thurber B-PERSON
did O
so O
gently O
and O
lightheartedly O
, O
many O
of O
dr. O
morgan B-PERSON
's O
supporters O
have O
taken O
thurber B-PERSON
's O
memorable O
title O
`` O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
male I-WORK_OF_ART
animal I-WORK_OF_ART
'' O
quite O
literally O
. O

the O
vehemence O
of O
the O
emotions O
aroused O
by O
the O
case O
testifies O
to O
its O
symbolic O
importance O
in O
the O
war O
that O
thurber B-PERSON
accepted O
as O
an O
eternal O
part O
of O
the O
human O
condition O
. O

a O
second B-ORDINAL
theme O
is O
the O
undercurrent O
of O
social O
class O
and O
race O
in O
the O
public O
reaction O
to O
the O
morgan B-PERSON
case O
. O

dr. O
morgan B-PERSON
is O
a O
highly O
educated O
white O
professional O
who O
attended O
some O
of O
the O
`` O
best O
'' O
schools O
. O

as O
members O
of O
the B-ORG
black I-ORG
caucus I-ORG
in O
congress B-ORG
asked O
during O
the O
debate O
on O
the O
legislation O
that O
freed O
dr. O
morgan B-PERSON
, O
does O
anyone O
seriously O
believe O
that O
if O
she O
were O
an O
uneducated O
, O
black O
, O
working O
- O
class O
woman O
, O
congress B-ORG
would O
have O
rushed O
to O
pass O
a O
private O
relief O
bill O
freeing O
her O
? O

or O
that O
the O
president O
would O
have O
hurried O
to O
sign O
the O
bill O
`` O
out O
of O
compassion O
for O
her O
plight O
'' O
? O

to O
ask O
those O
questions O
is O
to O
answer O
them O
. O

finally O
, O
the O
case O
of O
dr. O
morgan B-PERSON
gave O
congress B-ORG
an O
opportunity O
to O
act O
with O
unaccustomed O
decisiveness O
and O
to O
engage O
in O
one O
of O
its O
favorite O
pastimes O
-- O
bashing O
the O
district B-GPE
of I-GPE
columbia I-GPE
government O
. O

the O
local O

is O
discredited O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
many O

for O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons O
, O
and O

read O
the O
same O

and O
watch O
the O

people O
in O

bashing O
the O

i O
think O
that O
sometimes O
it O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
to O
be O
ticketed O
by O
uncle B-ORG
policeman I-ORG
. O

i O
remember O
reading O
a O
post O
by O
a O
fellow O
student O
, O
who O
said O
that O
he O
was O
in O
a O
very O
complicated O
frame O
of O
mind O
after O
seeing O
his O
parents O
taking O
off O
at O
the O
airport O
, O
and O
sped O
up O
to O
120 B-QUANTITY
miles O
on O
the O
highway O
while O
listening O
to O
swan B-WORK_OF_ART
lake I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

i O
have O
never O
driven O
on O
the O
highway O
, O
but O
this O
should O
have O
been O
speeding O
, O
right O
. O

i O
feel O
that O
he O
was O
extremely O
unlucky O
not O
to O
have O
encountered O
a O
police O
officer O
, O

some O
things O
, O
some O
people O
are O
just O
this O
way O
. O

he O
always O
finds O
you O
when O
there O
is O
nothing O
wrong O
, O
but O
disappears O
whenever O
he O
is O
needed O
. O

in O
a O
word O
, O
this O
fellow O
student O
had O
the O
real O
bad O
luck O
not O
to O
have O
encountered O
a O
police O
officer O
. O

in O
the O
end O
, O
he O
drove O
faster O
and O
faster O
until O
finally O
at O
140 B-QUANTITY
miles O
, O
he O
sped O
off O
the O
highway O
and O
plunged O
into O
the O
woods O
. O

but O
fortunately O
, O
people O
's O
luck O
always O
tends O
to O
balance O
out O
. O

although O
this O
fellow O
student O
did O
not O
encounter O
a O
police O
officer O
, O
at O
least O
he O
was O
not O
injured O
in O
the O
accident O
. O

it O
was O
said O
that O
he O
would O
have O
fallen O
into O
a O
river O
had O
he O
left O
the O
highway O
a O
moment O
later O
. O

so O
upon O
getting O
a O
ticket O
, O
just O
consider O
it O
the O
expense O
of O
averting O
a O

we O

what O

perhaps O

perhaps O

`` O

'' O

why O

a B-PERSON

even O

`` O

'' O

if O

they O
were O
when O
vice O
president O
quayle B-PERSON
voiced O
similar O
sentiments O
. O

it O
's O
somehow O
ok O
for O
secretary O
baker B-PERSON
himself O
, O
however O
, O
to O
say O
all O
the O
same O
things O

in O
fact O

he O

the O
quotes O

from O
mr. O

two B-DATE

so O
far O
as O
we O
can O
see O
, O
there O
is O
no O
disagreement O
among O
mr. O
baker B-PERSON
, O
mr. O
quayle B-PERSON
, O
the O
mr. O

we O
've O
read O
, O
or O
for O
that O

president O

. O

they O
all O
understand O
point O
one B-CARDINAL
: O
nothing O
the O
u.s. B-GPE
can O
do O
will O
make O
much O
difference O
in O
whether O
mr. O
gorbachev B-PERSON
succeeds O
with O
perestroika O
. O

perhaps O
mr. O
gates B-PERSON
would O
emphasize O
more O
than O
mr. O
baker B-PERSON
the O
many O
hurdles O
the O
soviet B-NORP
leader O
must O
leap O
if O
he O
is O
going O
to O
succeed O
. O

but O
everyone O
agrees O
that O
mr. O
gorbachev B-PERSON
's O
problems O
result O
from O
the O
failure O
of O
his O
own O
system O
. O

they O
can O
be O
relieved O
only O
by O
changing O
that O
system O
, O
not O
by O
pouring O
western O
money O
into O
it O

on O

so O
long O
as O
mr. O
gorbachev B-PERSON
is O
easing O
his O
grip O
on O
his O
empire O
, O
everyone O
we O
've O
heard O
agrees O
that O
the O
u.s. B-GPE
can O
benefit O
by O
engaging O
him O
. O

if O
a O

to O

the O

loose O

why O
not O
? O

we O
do O
n't O
expect O
much O
good O
from O
nuclear O

, O
but O
conventional O

arms O

might O
demilitarize O
eastern B-LOC

there O
's O
nothing O
in O
the O
least O
contradictory O
in O
all O
this O
, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
think O
that O
washington B-GPE
could O
tolerate O
a O
reasonably O
sophisticated O
, O
complex O
view O
. O

yet O
much O
of O
the O
political O
culture O
seems O
intent O
on O
castigating O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
for O
not O
`` O
helping O
'' O
mr. O
gorbachev B-PERSON
. O

so O
every O
time O
a O
bush B-PERSON
official O
raises O
a O
doubt O
about O
mr. O
gorbachev B-PERSON
, O
the O
washington B-GPE
community O
shouts O
`` O
cold B-EVENT
war I-EVENT
'' O
and O
`` O
timidity O

'' O
and O
an O
administration O

is O
quickly O
trotted O
out O
to O
reply O
, O
`` O
mr. O

'' O

mr. O

seems O
especially O
sensitive O
to O

in O

the O

not O
intra-administration O

i O

a O
proponent O
of O
everything O
gandhi B-PERSON
did O
, O
but O
some O
of O
his O
law O

was O
justified O
because O
india B-GPE
was O
then O
under O
occupation O
by O
a O
foreign O
power O
, O
and O
indians B-NORP
were O
not O
able O
to O
participate O
fully O
in O
decisions O
that O
vitally O
affected O
them O
. O

it O
is O
difficult O
, O
however O
, O
to O
justify O
civil O
disobedience O
, O
non-violent O
or O
not O
, O
where O
citizens O
have O
full O
recourse O
to O
the O
ballot O
box O
to O
effect O
change O
. O

where O
truly O
representative O
governments O
are O
safeguarded O
by O
constitutional O
protections O
of O
human O
rights O
and O
an O
independent O
judiciary O
to O
construe O
those O
rights O
, O
there O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
breaking O
the O
law O
because O
some O
individual O
or O
group O
disagrees O
with O
it O
. O

there O
may O
be O
a O
few O
cases O
where O
the O
law O
breaking O
is O
well O
pinpointed O
and O
so O
completely O
non-invasive O
of O
the O
rights O
of O
others O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
criticize O
it O
. O

the O

the O
black O

who O

the O
back O

comes O
to O
mind O
as O
an O
illustration O
. O

but O
most O
cases O
of O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
are O
not O
nearly O
so O
benign O
. O

the O
public O
has O
a O
tendency O
to O
equate O
lawful O
demonstrations O
with O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
. O

it O
is O
true O
that O
both O
are O
non-violent O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
fundamental O
difference O
between O
them O
. O

lawful O
demonstrations O
, O
such O
as O
peaceful O
picketing O
and O
other O
assemblages O
that O
do O
not O
disturb O
the O
peace O
or O
cause O
a O
public O
nuisance O
or O
interfere O
with O
the O
rights O
of O
others O
, O
are O
rights O
guaranteed O
by O
any O
truly O
free O
system O
of O

. O

civil O
disobedience O
, O
violent O
or O
non-violent O
, O
is O
intentional O
law O
breaking O
. O

the O
subject O
of O
this O
discussion O
is O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
; O
but O
, O
before O
we O
get O
on O
with O
that O
, O
let O
me O
make O
just O
a O
few O
tangential O
remarks O
about O
lawful O
demonstrations O
. O

they O
are O
useful O
to O
call O
public O
attention O
to O
grievances O
, O
but O
they O
have O
little O
value O
in O
educating O
anyone O
about O
the O
issues O
in O
dispute O
. O

the O
delight O
of O
television O
in O
dramatic O
confrontation O
encourages O
overuse O
of O
slogans O
chanted O
through O
bullhorns O
, O
militant O
gestures O
, O
accusatory O
signs O
and O
other O
emotionally O
inspired O
tactics O
. O

civilized O
discourse O
and O
an O
environment O
where O
compromise O
can O
begin O
are O
lost O
in O
a O
hostile O
posture O
abetted O
by O
superficial O
media O
interviews O
. O

at O
best O
, O
demonstrations O
are O
overused O
and O
boringly O
uninformative O
; O
at O
worst O
, O
they O
can O
become O
the O
stimuli O
that O
lead O
to O
law O
breaking O
. O

demonstrations O
are O
particularly O
apt O
to O
degenerate O
into O
criminal O
conduct O
when O
they O
leave O
the O
site O
of O
the O
grievance O
and O
become O
mobile O
. O

petty O
criminals O
and O
street O
people O
looking O
for O
excitement O
attach O
themselves O
like O
remora O
to O
the O
fringes O
of O
the O
crowd O
and O
use O
the O
protest O
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
rock O
throwing O
, O
auto O
trashing O
, O
arson O
, O
window O
breaking O
, O
looting O
, O
pocket O
picking O
and O
general O
hooliganism O
. O

soon O
the O
whole O
purpose O
of O
the O
demonstration O
is O
lost O
in O
mob O
mania O
. O

there O
are O
better O
ways O
to O
promote O
a O
cause O
. O

where O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
is O
the O
centerpiece O
, O
rather O
than O
a O
lawful O
demonstration O
that O
may O
only O
attract O
crime O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
justify O
. O

some O
find O
no O
harm O
in O
the O
misdemeanors O
of O
trespass O
, O
minor O
property O
destruction O
, O
blocking O
traffic O
and O
the O
like O
. O

they O
say O
these O
are O
small O
prices O
to O
pay O
for O
galvanizing O
action O
for O
the O
all O
- O
important O
cause O
. O

the O
crimes O
may O
appear O
small O
, O
but O
the O
prices O
can O
be O
huge O
. O

here O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
cases O
to O
illustrate O
. O

assume O
a O
neighborhood O
demonstration O
to O
protest O
speeding O
on O
a O
certain O
road O
or O
a O
careless O
accident O
involving O
a O
police O
car O
. O

the O
protesters O
lie O
down O
in O
the O
street O
, O
blocking O
traffic O
, O
and O
will O
not O
move O
until O
the O
authorities O
carry O
them O
away O
. O

assume O
that O
someone O
caught O
in O
the O
jam O
has O
a O
heart O
attack O
. O

there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
get O
an O
ambulance O
in O
quickly O
to O
move O
him O
to O
a O
hospital O
. O

he O
dies O
. O

the O
demonstration O
was O
non-violent O
and O
involved O
only O
a O
simple O
misdemeanor O
, O
but O
its O
impact O
on O
that O
individual O
was O
violent O
and O
terminal O
. O

assume O
that O
a O
tv O
network O
is O
airing O
a O
celebrity O
interview O
program O
with O
a O
live O
audience O
. O

the O
politician O
appearing O
is O
highly O
controversial O
and O
has O
recently O
generated O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
rancor O
amid O
certain O
groups O
. O

in O
a O
planned O
protest O
against O
his O
appearance O
, O
several O
members O
of O
the O
studio O
audience O
chain O
themselves O
in O
front O
of O
the O
tv O
cameras O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
the O
program O
can O
not O
continue O
. O

the O
network O
must O
refund O
money O
to O
the O
advertisers O
and O
loses O
considerable O
revenue O
and O
prestige O
. O

the O
demonstrators O
have O
been O
non-violent O
, O
but O
the O
result O
of O
their O
trespasses O
has O
been O
to O
seriously O
impair O
the O
rights O
of O
others O
unconnected O
with O
their O
dispute O
. O

it O
might O
be O
alleged O
that O
tv O
has O
done O
more O
than O
its O
share O
to O
popularize O
and O
promote O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
, O
so O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
situation O
hypothesized O
above O
would O
be O
simply O
a O
case O
of O
`` O
chickens O
coming O
home O
to O
roost O
. O
'' O

or O
maybe O
the O
tv O
network O
would O
lose O
nothing O
. O

geraldo B-PERSON
or O
phil B-PERSON
would O
probably O

us O
look O

at O
another O
type O

non-violent O

that O
only O
harms O

indirectly O

does O
irreparable O
damage O

the O

i O
am O
referring O
to O
those O
young O

who O
chose O
to O
disobey O
their O

call O
to O

during O
the B-EVENT
vietnam I-EVENT

and O
fled O
to O
canada B-GPE

some O

to O
avoid O

their O
cowardly O
acts O
of O
civil O
disobedience O
, O
which O
they O
tried O
to O
hide O
under O
the O
cloak O
of O
outrage O
at O
a O
war O
they O
characterized O
as O
`` O
immoral O

'' O
weakened O
the O

threw O
additional O
burdens O
on O
those O
who O
served O
honorably O
in O
that O

even O
more O
at O
fault O
are O
those O
leaders O
in O

out O
of O

who O
urged O
and O
supported O
their O
defections O
, O
thereby O
giving O
great O

to O
the O

. O

it O
is O
amazing O
that O
the O
ensuing O
mass O

in O

do O
not O
weight O
more O

it O
remained O

to O

finally O

do O

here O
is O
a O

if O

the O

the O

definitely O
be O
too O
tortuous O

seeing O
that O
just O
now O
, O
my O
first O

was O
that O
it O
was O
extremely O

why O

the B-ORG

the O

a O

addressing O
the O

conversing O
to O
create O
a O

for O
many O

also O
to O
make O

public O
in O

understand O
what O

in O

there O

the O
invitation O
was O
from O

this O

i O
was O
hoping O
that O

invite O

her O
future O

claiming O
power O
by O
being O
silent O
is O
something O
shameful O
for O
some O
countries O
as O
is O
deluding O
the O
people O
with O
their O
silence O
into O
thinking O
that O
they O
are O
powerful O
while O
in O
fact O
they O
are O
hiding O
their O
weakness O
. O

i O
think O
that O
dialogue O
is O
neither O
a O
shame O
nor O
should O
it O
be O
rejected O
.. O

you O
talk O
to O
your O
enemy O
and O
discuss O
with O
him O
.. O

but O
the O
closed O
door O
policy O
.. O
this O
is O
a O
disaster O
for O
the O
people O
and O
a O
pretense O
that O
you O
are O
brave O
through O
a O
lying O
and O
trumpeting O
media O
while O
in O
the O
end O
you O
fail O
in O
the O
least O
confrontation O
.. O

back O
to O
the O
main O
issue O
.. O
we O
say O
who O
is O
peres B-PERSON
? O

no O
one O
denies O
that O
peres B-PERSON
is O
a O
criminal O
. O

but O
who O
is O
peres B-PERSON
? O

peres B-PERSON
received O
the B-WORK_OF_ART

he O

" O

in O
other O
words O
, O
the O
man O
is O
looking O
for O
more O
peace O
than O
war O
. O

there O
is O
a O
difference O
between O
holding O
discussions O
with O
a O
man O
of O

and O
holding O
discussions O
with O
a O
man O
looking O
for O

peres B-PERSON

also O
a O

jointly O
with O
arafat B-PERSON
.. O

peres B-PERSON
spent O
money O
establishing O
the B-ORG
peres I-ORG
center I-ORG
for I-ORG
peace I-ORG
while O
yasser B-PERSON
arafat I-PERSON
spent O
money O
on O
his O
wife O
. O

we O
have O
n't O
heard O
that O
he O
established O
any O
organization O
to O
support O
the O
palestinian B-NORP
people O
with O
that O
money O
.. O

when O
he O
took O
office O
as O
prime O
minister O
peres B-PERSON
concluded O
successful O
transactions O
to O
acquire O
weapons O
. O

he O
also O
sought O
to O
establish O
a O
deterrent O
nuclear O
program O
since O
israel B-GPE
owns O
the O
biggest O
nuclear O
arsenal O
in O
the O
world O
. O

all O
this O
was O
during O
his O
tenure O
. O

this O
means O
that O
the O
man O
thinks O
and O
plans O
. O

this O
is O
due O
to O
his O
knowledge O
and O
studies O
in O
his O
field O
of O
electronics O
.. O

again O
we O
say O
that O
knowledge O
is O
a O
powerful O
weapon O
for O
any O
national O
progress O
.. O

peres B-PERSON
attained O
this O
as O
a O
result O
of O
.. O
knowledge O
and O
proficiency O
.. O
in O
his O
personality O
, O
which O
helped O
give O
him O
an O
edge O
in O
confronting O
any O
situation O
by O
putting O
him O
in O
a O
position O
of O
strength O
, O
and O
not O
weakness O
.. O

conversely O
, O
we O
see O
the O
squandering O
of O
money O
on O
the O
other O
side O
for O
trivial O
things O
that O
do O
not O
serve O
the O
palestinian B-NORP
cause O
and O
do O
not O
serve O
the O
arabs B-NORP
and O
the O
muslims B-NORP
. O

we O
find O
numerous O
satellite O
channels O
financed O
by O
islamic B-NORP
countries O
, O
and O
we O
also O
find O
numerous O
princes O
and O
kings O
and O
presidents O
who O
spend O
large O
amounts O
of O
money O
on O
their O
vacations O
. O

we O
also O
find O
that O
most O
of O
the O
arab B-NORP
people O
and O
some O
gulf B-LOC
people O
live O
below O
the O
poverty O
line O
.. O

furthermore O
, O
most O
of O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
arab B-NORP
and O
gulf B-LOC
states O
do O
not O
have O
any O
high O
scientific O
degree O
or O
any O
sound O
plan O
to O
build O
a O
strong O
country O
at O
the O
scientific O
level O
.. O

they O
do O
not O
even O
have O
any O
interest O
in O
education O
or O
in O
establishing O
strong O
universities O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
except O
for O

. O

back O
to O
our O
topic O
. O

some O
of O
those O
who O
posted O

in O
the O

did O
not O
mention O
the O

and O
did O
not O
refer O
to O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
visit O

they O
just O
posted O
the O

commented O
on O
the O

from O
their O
imagination O
.. O

his O
highness O
the O
prince O
receives O
the O

in O
an O

all O
this O
in O

in O

so O
as O
to O
bring O
views O
closer O

i O
think O
that O
this O
approach O

between O
peres B-PERSON

without O

by O

made O
qatar B-GPE
a O

the O

took O

there O
was O

agreement O

that O
is O
something O

but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
find O
different O
meetings O
without O
any O
outcome O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
democratic O
basis O
for O
dialogue O
. O

all O
that O
results O
from O
not O
accepting O
various O
opinions O
. O

conversely O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
freedom O
among O
the O
arab B-NORP
people O
we O
find O
that O
it O
is O
america B-GPE
which O
is O
in O
the O
driver O

steers O
guests O
wherever O
it O
wants O
and O
takes O
them O
on O
tours O
without O
any O
questioning O
directed O
at O
it O

all O
this O
marginalizes O
the O
arab B-NORP

as O
though O
he O
had O
no O
-lrb- O
mind O

or O
-lrb- O

, O
and O
you O
find O
that O
the O
areas O
he O
is O
allowed O

talk O
about O
are O
women O

in O
saudi B-GPE
arabia I-GPE

similar O
useless O
topics O

i O
would O
like O
to O
explain O
something O
to O
the O
brothers O
: O
peres B-PERSON
's O
visit O
is O
an O
internal O
qatari B-NORP
affair O
. O

it O
was O
announced O
in O
the O
newspapers O
that O
peres B-PERSON
would O
visit O
qatar B-GPE
, O
and O
it O
was O
announced O
in O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
qatari B-NORP
newspapers O
. O

there O
are O
writers O
in O
qatar B-GPE
who O
have O
positive O
opinions O
as O
well O
as O
negative O
opinions O
. O

this O
difference O
is O
good O
and O
something O
through O
which O
nations O
and O
people O
progress O
. O

that O
is O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
forum O
. O

while O
he O
was O
leaving O
the O

, O
a O

addressed O

the O
word O
" O

" O

which O
caused O
the O
accompanying O

him O

but O
the O
question O
now O
is O

. O

there O
are O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
defects O
in O
this O
exposition O
of O
yours O
. O

first B-ORDINAL
- O
lack O
of O
vision O
: O

you O
describe O
the O
contemporary O
qatari B-NORP
situation O
as O
just O
a O
legitimate O
quest O
for O
scientific O
and O
technological O
superiority O
.. O

if O
we O
could O
agree O
that O
we O
fall O
behind O
the O
zionists B-NORP
and O
americans B-NORP
in O
such O
fields O
... O
however O
the O
problem O
lies O
in O
ignoring O
all O
this O
clear O
evidence O
that O
the O
scientific O
project O
is O
nothing O
but O
a O
small O
misleading O
part O
of O
a O
campaign O
meant O
to O
change O
the O
islamic B-NORP
gulf B-LOC
and O
qatari B-NORP
identity O
and O
to O
remove O
its O
established O
fixed O
principles O
in O
which O
they O
surpass O
everything O
that O
the O
zionists B-NORP
and O
the O
americans B-NORP
have O
. O

how O
can O
you O
reconcile O
the O
will O
of O
scientific O
and O
technological O
progress O
.. O
and O
hosting O
the B-EVENT
asian I-EVENT
olympics I-EVENT
or O
a O
military O
base O
or O
a O
zionist B-NORP
politician O
or O
a O
program O
like O
the B-ORG
doha I-ORG
debates I-ORG
? O

so O
... O
the O
purely O
scientific O
and O
technological O
side O
can O
not O
justify O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
qatar B-GPE
. O

***** O

secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
contradiction O
of O
principle O
and O
the O
dominance O
of O
worldly O
interests O
. O

in O
your O
article O
here O
, O
you O
justified O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
hosting O
peres B-PERSON
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
exchanging O
opinions O
, O
dialogue O
, O
and O
using O
intellect O
... O

would O
you O
have O
held O
the O
same O
position O
if O
a O
terrorist O
or O
a O
well O
- O
known O
criminal O
were O
hosted O
under O
the O
slogan O
of O
, O
the O
language O
of O
reason O
, O
friendly O
media O
dialogue O
, O
and O
openness O
to O
the O
other O
?... O

would O
you O
accept O
it O
if O
your O
neighbor O
hosted O
someone O
who O
had O
attacked O
you O
?? O

so O
... O
there O
are O
principles O
that O
must O
be O
adhered O
to O
.. O

the O
most O
important O
of O
them O
is O
supporting O
the O
truth O
and O
loyalty O
to O
muslims B-NORP
even O
if O
it O
goes O
against O
narrow O
personal O
interests O
... O
and O
the O
relationship O
of O
saudi B-GPE
arabia I-GPE
with O
the O
americans B-NORP
... O

despite O
my O
being O
convinced O
that O
it O
should O
be O
limited O
after O
the O
latter O
's O
aggression O
, O
it O
does O
not O
in O
any O
way O
reach O
the O
level O
of O
the O
relationship O
of O
qatar B-GPE
with O
the O
americans B-NORP
themselves O
. O

-lrb- O
the O
tension O
in O
the O
relations O
with O
saudi B-GPE
arabia I-GPE
recently O
and O
the O
military O
base O
on O
the O
qatari B-NORP
territory O
despite O
the O
state O
of O
peace O
in O
the O
region O
are O
evidence O
of O
that O
-rrb- O
... O

so O
how O
come O
qatar B-GPE
is O
now O
adding O
to O
this O
with O
intimate O
relations O
with O
those O
whose O
existence O
and O
history O
and O
reality O
are O
entirely O
connected O
to O
aggression O
against O
muslims B-NORP
.. O
namely O
the O
zionists B-NORP
!!? O

a O
mistake O
can O
not O
be O
justified O
by O
committing O
a O
bigger O
mistake O
or O
proceeding O
further O
in O
it O
!! O
. O

**** O

thirdly B-ORDINAL
, O
going O
overboard O
with O
freedom O
: O

there O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
mania O
in O
the O
field O
of O
freedom O
that O
makes O
many O
people O
think O
that O
every O
freedom O
is O
commendable O
.. O
while O
giving O
free O
rein O
to O
freedom O
is O
a O
recipe O
for O
chaos O
and O
corruption O
.. O
even O
in O
the O
field O
of O
speech O
or O
science O
... O

for O
example O
, O
there O
is O
no O
room O
for O
freedom O
in O
talking O
about O
god O
and O
his O
prophet B-PERSON
and O
his O
verses O
since O
it O
comes O
in O
the O
context O
of O
what O
brought O
the O
disbelievers O
to O
hell O
. O

but O
we O
used O
to O
embark O
boldly O
with O
bold O
talkers O
.. O

there O
is O
no O
room O
for O
leaving O
the O
door O
wide O
open O
for O
discussing O
or O
teaching O
" O
science O
and O
technology O
" O
as O
the O
theory O
of O
development O
.. O
or O
the O
theories O
of O
darwin B-PERSON
.. O
or O
how O
to O
make O
bombs O
or O
liquor O
.. O
or O
the O
creeds O
of O
polytheism O
or O
excessiveness O
in O
regarding O
others O
as O
unbelievers O
.. O
or O
the O
sciences O
of O
judging O
with O
anything O
other O
than O
the O
revelations O
of O
god O
-lrb- O
except O
by O
the O
way O
of O
warning O
against O
them O
-rrb- O
.. O

so O
... O
imposing O
censorship O
and O
certain O
regulations O
on O
the O
work O
of O
educational O
and O
media O
institutions O
is O
not O
a O
matter O
for O
censure O
or O
a O
sign O
of O
backwardness O
... O
rather O
it O
might O
be O
a O
necessary O
and O
urgent O
requirement O
... O
especially O
if O
those O
in O
charge O
of O
theses O
institutions O
are O
non-muslims B-NORP
.. O
or O
if O
the O
ones O
exposed O
are O
our O
younger O
generation O
and O
the O
treasures O
of O
our O
nation O
!!. O

you O
might O
even O
be O
filled O
with O
admiration O
of O
the O
contradiction O
in O
attitudes O
when O
you O
see O
the O
" O
supporters O
of O
freedom O
" O
demanding O
the O
imposition O
of O
government O
censorship O
on O
courses O
in O
koran B-WORK_OF_ART
memorization O
, O
charitable O
institutions O
, O
and O
the O
pulpits O
in O
some O
of O
our O
countries O
!!!!. O

+++ O

what O
is O
happening O
in O
qatar B-GPE
is O
a O
political O
and O
intellectual O
penetration O
in O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
region O
in O
every O
meaning O
of O
the O
word O
.. O

the O
danger O
they O
face O
is O
very O
serious O
... O

of O
course O
, O
those O
who O
want O
to O
penetrate O
us O
will O
not O
declare O
that O
... O

rather O
, O
they O
will O
hide O
their O
aims O
behind O
sweet O
words O
or O
promises O
of O
providing O
limited O
or O
imaginary O
benefits O
... O

otherwise O
, O
we O
would O
not O
be O
deceived O
by O
the O
trick O
... O

for O
many O
muslims B-NORP
today O
their O
priorities O
are O
confused O
... O

so O
they O
weigh O
things O
without O
the O
guidance O
of O
god O
... O

this O
is O
the O
real O
reason O
for O
our O
present O
situation O
.. O
not O
just O
because O
of O
scientific O
or O
technological O
backwardness O
. O

-lrb- O
you O
will O
find O
the O
jews B-NORP
and O
polytheists O
the O
ones O
most O
hostile O
to O
the O
believers O
-rrb- O
. O

-lrb- O
god O
forbids O
you O
to O
turn O
in O
friendship O
to O
those O
who O
fought O
against O
you O
with O
regard O
to O
your O
religion O
and O
who O
drove O
you O
out O
of O
your O
homes O
and O
who O
helped O
others O
drive O
you O
out O
. O

those O
who O
turn O
to O
them O
are O
evildoers O
-rrb- O
. O

there O
are O
four B-CARDINAL
types O
of O
men O
: O

the O
man O
who O
knows O
and O
knows O
that O
he O
knows O
. O

he O
is O
a O
scholar O
, O
so O
ask O
him O
. O

the O
man O
who O
knows O
but O
does O
not O
know O
that O
he O
knows O
. O

he O
has O
forgotten O
, O
so O
remind O
him O

the O
man O
who O
does O
not O

knows O
that O
he O

but O
my O
opinion O
is O
for O
you O

the O
qataris B-NORP
to O
discuss O
with O
him O
the O
issue O
of O
murdering O
innocent O
children O

usurping O
the O
rights O
of O
others O
. O

or O
more O
clearly O
, O
you O
should O
ask O
him O
to O
explain O
to O
you O
how O
to O
hate O
your O
neighbors O
and O
maybe O
he O
would O
train O
you O

train O
you O

the O

i O
believe O
what O

in O

not O

you O
justify O

this O

these O

you O

this O

my O

just O

i O
did O

i O

just O
wait O

wait O

some O

the O
matter O

whether O
to O
open O
the O

dragged O
on O

on O

and O
finally O
, O
because O
the O
pressure O
from O
public O

was O
so O
great O

they O
re-examined O
the O

the O

when O

everybody O

there O
was O
a O
trial O

the O

was O
found O
guilty O

murdering O
her O

everybody O
felt O
that O

in O
such O
a O
case O

she O
would O
certainly O
get O
the O
death O

she O
was O

some O
people O
said O
that O
again O
this O

i O
think O

all O

this O

in O
no O

the O

due O
largely O
to O
the O

the O

that O

this O

uh O

they O
have O

anything O
in O

are O
very O
low O

, O
that O
is O

it O
is O

does O
n't O
really O
have O
much O

this O
, O
now O

my O
question O
is O
, O
when O
is O
a O
victim O
guilty O
of O
abuse O
? O

jackson B-PERSON
is O
definitely O
a O
mind O
- O
control O
, O
sra O
victim O
. O

he O
's O
programmed O
. O

neverland B-FAC
sounds O
like O
a O
cryptic O
command O
from O
mkultra O
wizard O
of O
oz O
programming O
. O

the O
bizarre O
from O
black O
- O
to O
- O
white O
and O
physical O
transformation O
must O
be O
the O
result O
of O
biotech O
advances O
. O

if O
he O
does O
abuse O
' O
his O
' O
children O
, O
is O
he O
' O
guilty O
' O
as O
such O
if O
he O
is O
programmed O
? O

i O
suspect O
he O
is O
a O
brilliant O
cover O
or O
red O
- O
herring O
used O
as O
a O
shield O
by O
very O
powerful O
forces O
, O
responsible O
for O
god O
- O
knows O
- O
what O
at O
his O
now O
- O
abandoned O
ranch O
. O

it O
's O
very O
effective O
, O
as O
many O
' O
feel O
' O
that O
whilst O
mj B-PERSON
is O
naive O
he O
's O
not O
capable O
of O
the O
evil O
associated O
with O
pedophile O
activity O
. O

this O
may O
not O
be O
the O
case O
, O
as O
the O
public O
' O
persona O
' O
is O
merely O
an O
' O
alter O
' O
personality O
and O
he O
may O
have O
many O
other O
' O
personalities O
' O
which O
are O
dark O
. O

then O
comes O
the O
question O
whether O
his O
programmers O
were O
programmed O
themselves O
. O

if O
so O
, O
then O
they O
are O
all O
guilty O
of O
such O
abuse O
, O
whilst O
being O
innocent O
at O
the O
same O
time O
! O

as O
most O
abuse O
is O
generational O
, O
the O
whole O
mind O
- O
control O
subject O
really O
has O
to O
be O
brought O
out O
in O
the O
open O
. O

the O
very O
technology O
and O
tools O
used O
on O
the O
mind O
which O
harm O
can O
then O
be O
used O
to O
heal O
. O

i O

the O

has O

which O
usually O

poison O

come O
in O

they O
usually O
give O

the O

forces O

put O

recent O
studies O
by O
georgeson B-ORG

conclude O
that O
corporations O
with O

have O
experienced O
greater O
stock O

price O
appreciation O
than O
corporations O
without O
poison O

during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE

. O

critics O
of O
poison O
pills O
argue O
that O
they O
harm O
shareholders O
by O
letting O
corporate O
management O
defeat O
takeover O
bids O
at O
premium O
prices O
and O
by O
deterring O
premium O
bids O
from O
ever O
being O
made O
to O
shareholders O
. O

these O
critics O
are O
backed O
by O
several O
academic O
studies O
showing O
that O
the O
adoption O
of O
poison O
pills O
reduces O
shareholder O
values O
not O
merely O
in O
the O
short O
run O
, O
but O
also O
over O
longer O
periods O
. O

institutional O
investors O
that O
must O
evaluate O
poison O
pills O
on O
a O
regular O
basis O
are O
interested O
less O
in O
this O
general O
debate O
than O
in O
the O
answers O
to O
specific O
questions O
about O
the O
corporation O
issuing O
the O
pill O
. O

does O
this O
corporation O
have O
a O
high O
- O
quality O
management O
team O
with O
a O
good O
track O
record O
? O

does O
this O
team O
have O
a O
viable O
strategy O
for O
improving O
shareholder O
values O
, O
and O
does O
this O
strategy O
require O
implementation O
over O
an O
extended O
period O
? O

will O
the O
adoption O
of O
this O
particular O
form O
of O
a O
poison O
pill O
significantly O
improve O
the O
chances O
for O

to O
carry O
out O
this O
strategy O
? O

if O
the O
answers O
to O
these O
questions O
are O
affirmative O
, O
then O
institutional O
investors O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
favorably O
disposed O
toward O
a O
specific O
poison O

. O

however O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
once O
most O
poison O

are O
adopted O
, O
they O
survive O
forever B-DATE

although O

the O
solution O
to O
this O
problem O

the O

range O

at O
the O

always O
maintained O

" O

perhaps O
it O

this O
is O
the O
advice O

give O

: O

it O
's O
true O
that O
good O

can O
come O
from O
external O
grooming O
, O
wearing O
nice O
clothes O
, O
or O
wearing O
earrings O
; O
and O
perhaps O
you O
can O
get O
other O
people O
's O
attention O
by O
creating O
your O
own O
special O
look O
. O

but O
do O
n't O
overdo O
it O
. O

it O
is O
appropriate O
dress O
, O
and O
a O
temperament O
developed O
through O
study O

which O

the O

. O

to O
gao B-PERSON
, O
the O
only O
standard O
for O
judging O
literature O
is O
the O
beauty O
of O
its O
language O
, O
and O

itself O
is O
a O
means O
of O
getting O
at O
" O
reality O
. O
" O

gao B-PERSON
refers O
to O
his O
own O
approach O
to O
writing O
as O
" O
stream O
- O
of O
- O

" O
and O
believes O
that O
writers O
who O
seek O
a O
vivid O
, O
modern O
chinese B-NORP
face O
an O
extremely O
difficult O
path O
. O

gao B-PERSON
also O
revealed O
that O
to O
ensure O
that O
his O

remains O
fresh O

, O
he O
first O
speaks O
his O

before O
later O
recasting O
them O
in O
a O

form O
. O

gao B-PERSON
xingjian I-PERSON
feels O
that O
writing O
is O
an O
extremely O
personal O
pursuit O
, O
that O
its O
starting O
point O
is O
a O
quest O
for O
personal O
values O
. O

if O
a O
writer O
is O
to O
produce O
good O
work O
, O
he O
must O
cast O
aside O
political O
and O
social O
missions O
, O
disregard O
the O
opinions O
of O
readers O
and O
the O
market O
, O
and O
instead O
must O
write O
spontaneously O
, O
listening O
carefully O
to O
the O
faintest O
, O
most O
honest O
voice O
in O
his O
heart O
. O

considering O
that O
gao B-PERSON
fled O
a O
tyrannical O

to O

an O

, O
many O
people O
wonder O
whether O
gao B-PERSON

literature O
insists O
upon O
humanitarianism O
and O
high O
principles O
. O

but O
gao B-PERSON
feels O
that O

is O
above O

it O

what O

is O
that O
moussa B-PERSON
insists O
on O
making O
a O
crack O
in O
the O

crisis O
; O
he O
considered O
that O
the O
door O
is O
open O
for O
meetings O

because O
the O

the O

all O
cautiousness O

all O

at O
the O

with O

because O

to O
progress O

a O
step O
that O

eager O
for O

to O
welcome O
, O
even O

notable O

i O

this O
is O
an O

rather O
, O
but O
this O
is O
what O
the O
navy B-ORG
does O
with O
regard O
to O
prevention O
. O

everybody O
that O
is O
, O
every O
sailor O
that O
's O
entering O
the O
navy B-ORG
does O
take O
a O
swim O
test O
. O

they O
learn O
how O
to O
tread O
water O
and O
do O
the O
dead O
man O
float O
and O
they O
have O
to O
pass O
that O
in O
order O
to O

as O
the O

, O
those O

off O

but O
they O
know O
where O
to O
go O
quickly O
. O

they O
also O
wear O

you O
can O

the O

you O
will O
hear O
a O
p.a. O
announcement O
around O
the O

ship O
, O
there O
is O
a O
man O

so O
everyone O
knows O
they O
have O
to O
react O
quickly O
. O

a O
ship O
- O
wide O
search O
will O
happen O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
person O
go O
overboard O
, O
but O
if O
indeed O
they O
do O
see O
someone O
go O
overboard O
, O
the O
ship O
starts O
to O
circle O
that O
area O
continuously O
. O

also O
small O
boats O
sometimes O
go O
out O
into O
the O
water O
, O
but O
even O
more O
importantly O
, O
helicopters O
are O
launched O
immediately O
. O

inside O
those O
helicopters O
rescue O
swimmers O
. O

if O
indeed O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
located O
, O
well O
the O
hoister O
is O
dropped O
down O
with O
usually O
a O
torso O
harness O
. O

if O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
injured O
then O
they O
may O
use O
a O
basket O
, O
but O
more O
than O
likely O
those O
swimmers O
will O
go O
right O
into O
the O
water O
and O
try O
and O
help O
the O
swimmer O
hook O
up O
on O
that O
harness O
and O
pull O
them O
up O
into O
the O
helo O
and O
pull O
them O
back O
on O
to O
the O
ship O
for O
treatment O
and O
usually O
a O
search O
takes O
about B-TIME
24 I-TIME

. O

the O
search O
crews O
will O
go O
24 B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
calling O
off O
that O
search O
. O

why O
call O
it O
off O
? O

there O
's O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
to O
look O
at O
. O

depending O
on O
the O
water O
temperature O
, O
it O
's O
very O
possible O
that O
or O
very O
common O
in O
cold O
water O
that O
someone O
will O
not O
survive O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

also O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
24 B-TIME

hour I-TIME
search O
is O
they O
fail O
they O

exhausted O

that O

the O
`` O

are O
poorly O

complex O
in O

in O

from O

you O

the O

you O
did O

in O
a O

the B-ORG

pointed O
out O
that O

a O

if O
a O

the O

are O
complex O

defying O

if O

this O
will O
require O
us O

more O

mr. O

to O
his O
hosts O
, O
a O
california B-GPE
church O

that O
opposes O

he O
said O
that O

`` O

that O
`` O

'' O

he O
recalled O
to O
the O
audience O
a O
`` O
strange O

infelicitous O
'' O
analogy O
he O
once O
heard O
arguing O

'' O
mr. O

objected O
to O
this O
analogy O
because O
it O
seems O
to O
`` O
assimilate O
the O

`` O

'' O
he O
said O
, O
subject O
to O
being O
taken O
back O
. O

he O
says O
the O
title O
of O
his O
speech O
was O
to O
make O
his O
point O
that O
americans B-NORP
have O
rights O
as O
individuals O
, O
not O
as O
members O
of O
certain O
select O
groups O
. O

his O
speech O
criticized O
the O
`` O
idiocy O
of O
notions O
of O
protected O
groups O
in O
society O
'' O
as O
opposed O
to O
individual O
equality O
or O
, O
as O
he O
put O
it O
, O
in O
`` O
a O
common O
destiny O
as O
americans B-NORP
. O
'' O

instead O
of O
lobbying O
for O
special O
treatment O
, O
mr. O
allen B-PERSON
said O
that O
homosexuals O

others O
should O
try O
to O
ensure O
equal O
treatment O
under O
the O

not O
aim O

the O
three B-CARDINAL
most O

that O
he O

a O

he O

made O

to O
defend O
an O
indian B-NORP

had O
been O
adopted O
by O

off O

. O

mr. O
allen B-PERSON
quickly O
ran O
up O
against O
the O
liberal O
establishment O
again O
, O
which O
somehow O
elevated O
the O
vague O
concept O
of O
`` O
indian B-NORP
rights O
'' O
above O
the O

indeed O

the O

large O

mr. O

critics O
refuse O

their O

some O
say O
drinking O
milk O
on O

will O
consume O
the O

but O
actually O
milk O

about O
45 B-PERCENT

lactose O

which O
is O
carbohydrate O
that O

who O

what O

that O
if O
there O

it O

then O
indeed O
inappropriate O

it O
is O
better O

said O
milk O
can O

20 B-DATE

they O
hardly O

long O

if O
they O

the O

now O

the B-ORG

department I-ORG
proposed O
that O

be O
required O
to O
keep O
detailed O
records O
of O

which O

believe O
is O
the O
main O

used O
by O

to O
move O
billions B-MONEY
of I-MONEY

in O

in O
recent O
testimony O
on O

officials O
said O
they O
were O
considering O

the O
expected O
publication O

the O
proposal O
in O
the B-ORG
federal I-ORG

today B-DATE
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
official O
step O
toward O
creating O

the O

still O
working O
out O

among O
the O

the O

another O

draw O

which O

rather O

a O

first B-ORDINAL
, O
stockholm B-GPE
spent O
$ B-MONEY
180 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
on O
transportation O

before O
the O

would O
the O
experiment O
have O

as O
successful O
if O
they O
had O
not O
spent O
the O
money O
? O

was O
the O
`` O
success O
'' O
a O
manufactured O
result O
to O
cover O
up O
for O
the O
previously O
failed O
investment O
? O

second B-ORDINAL
, O
stockholm B-GPE
had O
the O
presence O
of O
mind O
and O
the O
fairness O
of O
government O
to O
put O
this O
together O
as O
an O
experiment O
, O
and O
allow O
the O
citizens O
to O
dismantle O
it O
later O
if O
they O
thought O
it O
not O
worthwhile O
. O

that O
is O
an O
admirable O
approach O
, O

what O
us B-NORP
government O
has O
ever O
incorporated O
a O
policy O
as O
a O
test O
and O
then O
put O
it O
up O
for O
referendum O
? O

one O
of O
our O
problems O
is O
that O
having O
made O
a O
mistake O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
get O
the O
government O
to O
own O
up O
to O
it O
. O

where O
is O
the O
referendum O
on O
whether O
we O
should O
spend O
umpteen B-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
on O
the O
tyson B-LOC
's O
project O
? O

focus O
groups O
and O
special O
interests O
do O
n't O
count O
. O

third B-ORDINAL
, O
granted O
, O
the O
government O
in O
stockholm B-GPE
has O
every O
incentive O
to O
spin O
this O
in O
a O
good O
light O
, O

and O
all O
the O
reviews O
seem O
good O
. O

i O
'm O
suspicious O
when O
no O
one O
seems O
to O
be O
able O
to O
find O
any O
shortcomings O
. O

in O
london B-GPE
, O
it O
took O
quite O
some O
time O
for O
the O
economic O
effects O
to O
sort O
themselves O
out O
and O
be O
measured O
. O

although O
the O
london B-GPE
experiment O
also O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
success O
, O
there O
is O
considerable O
movement O
against O
it O
and O
the O
rapid O
rise O
in O
tolling O
charges O
that O
followed O
. O

it O
does O
not O
seem O
likely O
that O
it O
will O
be O
repeated O
in O
other O
english B-NORP
cities O
. O

for O
the O
record O
, O
i O
'm O
in O
favor O
of O
congestion O
tolling O
, O
but O
i O
also O
think O
it O
will O
hasten O
the O
de-emphasis O
of O
central O
areas O
. O

in O
london B-GPE
there O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
distinct O
decrease O
in O
business O
just O
inside O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
congestion O
zone O
and O
a O
distinct O
increase O
just O
outside O
. O

it O
is O
too O
soon O
to O
see O
what O
happens O
in O
stockholm B-GPE
, O

but O
the O
situation O
in O
stockholm B-GPE
is O
a O
lot O
different O
from O
london B-GPE
. O

singapore B-GPE
is O
another O
example O
of O
effective O
use O
of O
congestion O

i O
'm O
not O
usre O
that O
there O

much O

any O

obviously O

the O
primary O
difference O
between O
this O
country O
and O
other O
countries O
' O
use O
of O
electronic O

is O
that O
we O
're O
still O
thinking O
of O
individual O
roads O
whereas O
those O
other O
countries O
are O
implementing O
electronic O
tolling O
for O
the O
region O
- O
as O
a O
way O
to O
shape O
the O
entire O
network O
's O
congestion O
. O

so O
.. O
think O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
entire O
nova B-LOC
area O
with O
a O
connecting O
network O
of O
electronically O
tolled O
roads O
being O
priced O
by O
the O
hour B-TIME
... O
and O
the O
place O
much O
like O
cell O
phone O
minutes O
. O

you O
have O
to O
admit O
- O
the O
cell O
phone O
business O
model O
does O
two B-CARDINAL
things O
very O
, O
very O
well O
. O

first B-ORDINAL
, O
you O
pay O
for O
when O
/ O
where O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
a O
free O
ride O

and O
second B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
cell O
companies O
collect O
enough O
in O
revenues O
to O
keep O
building O
more O
cell O
towers O
and O
expand O
coverage O
. O

think O
about O
the O
same O
model O
with O
roads O
and O
electronic O
tolling O
. O

larry B-PERSON
, O
the O
cell O
phone O
analogy O
is O
brilliant O
. O

that O
is O
the O
logic O
of O
where O
the O
technology O
will O
take O
us O
-- O
if O
only O
politics O
do O
n't O
stand O
in O
the O
way O
. O

either O
nova B-PERSON
scout I-PERSON
is O
right O
or O
larry B-PERSON
is O
right O
. O

congestion O
pricing O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
limited O
singapore B-GPE
's O
economic O
activity O
, O
but O
how O
would O
you O
know O
? O

for O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
it O
's O
like O
traffic O
congestion O
: O

the O
demand O
is O
so O
high O
that O
even O
if O
you O
build O
new O
roads O
or O
throttle O
the O
demand O
, O
it O
is O
still O
high O
. O

for O
another O
, O
if O
larry B-PERSON
is O
right O
and O
congestion O
pricing O
has O
shaped O
the O
region O
, O
then O
some O
of O
that O
economic O
activity O
is O
not O
happening O
where O
it O
might O
have O
otherwise O
. O

transportation O
is O
very O
closey O
connected O
with O
economic O
activity O
. O

so O
in O
that O
sense O
, O
what O
tolling O
does O
is O
impose O
a O
tax O
on O
profits O
that O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
made O
. O

i O
think O
you O
should O
tax O
only O
income O
and O
sales O
, O
but O
i O
suppose O
you O
could O
rationalize O
this O
as O
a O
sales O
tax O
on O
use O
of O
the O
roads O
. O

i O
still O
think O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
institute O
tolling O
except O
in O
special O
circumstances O
: O
expensive O
bridges O
, O
and O
highly O
congested O
zones O
, O
for O
example O
. O

otherwise O
a O
gas O
tax O
set O
high O
enough O
to O
do O
its O
job O
is O
still O
a O
fairer O
and O
cheaper O
method O
, O
and O
more O
environmentally O
friendly O
: O

the O
infrastructure O
is O
in O
place O
, O
and O
it O
automatically O
taxes O
by O
distance O
, O
weight O
, O
and O

palau B-GPE

it O

: O
the O

even O

the O

is O
that O

more O

which O

" O
the O

unique O

perhaps O
palau B-GPE
is O
, O
as O
gennie B-PERSON

says O
, O
like O
a O
just O
- O
opened O
oyster O

with O
the O
pearl O
gleaming O
before O
your O

. O

but O
to O
grasp O
the O
pearl O
, O
taiwan B-GPE
business O
people O
will O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
their O
wisdom O
and O
experience O
. O


so O
, O
just O
now O
these O
two O
, O
eh O
, O
were O
analyzing O
these O
, O
ah O
, O
four B-QUANTITY
kidd B-PERSON
class O
warships O
from O
different O
angles O
, O
some O
intrinsic O
problems O
that O
exist O
with O
them O
and O
the O
effectiveness O
they O
are O
able O
to O
achieve O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
military O
capabilities O
. O

so O
, O
at O
this O
current O
level O
, O
for O
the O
taiwanese B-NORP
military O
, O
can O
they O
improve O
the O
current O
military O
strength O
of O
the O
taiwanese B-NORP
military O
. O

i O
should O
say O
that O
, O
eh O
, O
these O
four B-QUANTITY
warships O
entering O
the O
taiwanese B-NORP
navy O
will O
certainly O
enhance O
somewhat O
the O
taiwanese B-NORP
military O
strength O
on O
the O
ocean O
. O

yeah O
. O

but O
i O
should O
say O
this O
improvement O
is O
still O
quite O
a O
long O
way O
from O
the O
goals O
that O
taiwanese B-NORP
authorities O
and O
taiwanese B-NORP
military O
want O
to O
achieve O
. O

so O
, O
taking O
a O
broader O
perspective O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
's O
like O
, O
er O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
for O
the O
taiwanese B-NORP
navy O
, O
it O
's O
slapping O
a O

of O

, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
the O
surface O
of O
a O

, O
eh O
, O
to O
make O
it O
look O
, O
eh O
, O
better O
, O
more O
splendid O
. O

but O
a O
house O
of O
straw O
is O
a O
house O
of O
straw O
after O
all O
: O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
stand O
up O
when O
the O
big O
bad O
wolf O
comes O
. O

i O
think O
the O
political O
significance O
is O
greater O
than O
the O
military O
significance O
. O

they O
seem O
to O
feel O
that O
after O
buying O
these O
four O
, O
four O
warships O
, O
eh O
, O
they O
psychologically O
feel O
, O
feel O
that O
they O
've O
become O
a O
little O
closer O
with O
the O
us B-GPE
. O

psychologically O
they O
feel O
that O
once O
they O
've O
got O
these O
four B-QUANTITY
, O
then O
it O
's O
as O
chief O
editor O
chen B-PERSON
said O
just O
now O
: O
i O
slap O
on O
a O
coat O
of O
gold O
paint O
, O
then O
at O
least O
when O
the O
wolf O
comes O
, O
this O
first O
layer O
should O
be O
able O
to O
act O
, O
to O
a O
limited O
extent O
, O
to O
act O
as O
a O
little O

they O
even O
fantasize O

ten B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
by O
then O
. O

that O
's O
not O
too O
early O
to O
travel O
is O
it O
? O

nope O
. O

i O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
like O
much O
easier O
to O
travel O
if O
we O
went O
when O
he O
was O
ten B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
than O
-- O
yep O
, O
yep O
, O
yep O
. O
-- O
you O
know O
after O
that O
. O

when O
they O
're O
new O
infants O
it O
's O
like O
bring O
along O
a O
blanket O
so O
you O
can O
nurse O
them O
. O

and O
like O
you O
could O
do O
anything O
. O

you O
could O
probably O
go O
like O
do O
skydiving O
or O
something O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
know O
. O

and O
if O
you O
were O
nursing O
the O
baby O
while O
you O
were O
skydiving O
the O
baby O
would O
be O
like O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

alright O
. O

as O
long O
as O
we O
're O
nursing O
while O
we O
're O
doing O
this O
that O
's O
okay O
. O

that O
's O
what O
i O
thought O
too O
. O

and O
they O
do O
n't O
need O
that O
many O
clothes O
when O
they O
're O
that O
young O
. O

and O
they O
do O
n't O
need O
toys O
. O

so O
. O

you O
know O
basically O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
bring O
anything O
. O
but O
%uh O
but O
you O
know O
your O
two B-CARDINAL
boobs O
. O

and O
%uh O
and O
since O
i O
ca O
n't O
really O
go O
anywhere O
without O
those O
anyhow O

they O
're O
hard O
to O
forget O

yeah O
. O

hard O
to O
leave O
behind O
. O

yeah O
. O

so O
i O
mean O
in O
then O
you O
know O
then O
we O
can O
just O
use O
disposables O
if O
we O
're O
travelling O
, O

so O

oh O
definitely O
. O

do O
n't O

we O
did O

one B-CARDINAL
time O
we O
were O
like O
we O
were O
travelling O
in O
the O
car O

we O
were O
like O
oh O
we O
can O
just O
bring O
a O
little O
mini O
diaper O
pail O
and O
all O
. O

yeah O
. O

that O
was O
after O
one B-CARDINAL
time O

i O
went O
never O
again O
. O

disposables O
for O
travelling O
. O

and O
did O
you O
%um O
absolutely O
. O
every O
now O
did O
you O
supplement O
nursing O
with O
bottles O
at O
all O
or O
did O
n't O
, O
did O
n't O
you O
? O

no O
. O

no O
. O

somehow O
like O
i O
read O
too O
many O
of O
the O
books O

so O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
like O
no O
formula O
. O

it O
does O
make O
a O
difference O

like O
i O
always O
thought O
formula O
smells O
kind O
of O
disgusting O

oh O
yeah O
. O

like O
when O
they O
throw O
up O
it O
smells O
disgusting O

and O
when O
they O
make O
their O
little O
doo O
- O
doo's O
it O
smells O
grosser O
if O
they O
're O
on O
formula O
. O

but O
if O
they O
're O
totally O
breast O
milk O
now O
you O
'll O
find O
this O
hard O
this O
believe O
but O
if O
they O
're O
totally O
breast O
milk O
for O
like O
the O
first O
couple O
months O
-- O
mhm O
. O
they O
do O
n't O
their O
number O
twos O
do O
n't O
smell O
at O
all O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

they O
do O
n't O
smell O
like O
anything O
. O

it O
's O
like O
it O
looks O
like O
shit O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
smell O
like O
anything O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

and O
did O
you O
pump O
or O
not O
? O

yeah O
i O
pumped O
. O

what O
joy O
that O
was O
. O

did O
you O
use O
a O
manual O
or O
a O
%uh O
did O
you O
get O
one O
of O
those O
little O
battery O
ones O
? O

batter- O
battery O
operated O
deal O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
think O
so O
too O
. O

now O
like O
i O
can O
tell O
you O

i O
can O
find O
the O
exact O
brand O
name O
of O
it O
if O
you O
want O
some O
time O
. O

but O
like O
it O
had O
like O
this O
little O
like O
nozzle O
attachment O
thing O
on O
it O
which O
was O
what O
it O
said O
you O
were O
supposed O
to O
use O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

and O
i O
used O
it O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
for O
like O
three B-TIME
seconds I-TIME

i O
was O
like O
-- O
-- O
%ah O
get O
this O
thing O
off O
me O
. O

that O
really O
hurt O
. O

do O
n't O
ever O
do O
that O
again O
. O

and O
i O
forget O
what O
it O
said O
it O
was O
for O

i O
think O
it O
said O
it O
was O
for O
if O
you O
had O
small O
breasts O
or O
something O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
what O

oh O
okay O
. O

so O
like O
i O
took O
that O
thing O

and O
i O
threw O
it O
away O
. O

it O
was O
like O
a O
little O
part O
you O
put O
on O
top O
of O
a O
nozzle O
thing O
. O

it O
was O
just O
like O
an O
extra O
attachment O

and O
i O
took O
that O

and O
i O
-- O
mhm O
okay O
. O
-- O
threw O
it O
away O

okay O
. O

and O
then O
it O
was O
fine O
. O

okay O
. O

so O
. O

yeah O
. O

that O
seemed O
to O
work O
fine O

ye- O

you O
know O
i- O
if O
i O
, O
if O
you O
could O
avoid O
it O
you O
know O
if O
y- O
if O
it O
was O
a O
choice O
in O
your O
life O
to O
say O
well O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
couple O
months O
i O
'll O
just O
be O
home O

and O
i O
'll O
just O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
rest O

and O
i O
'll O
take O
it O
easy O

and O
if O
i O
'm O
not O
-- O
-- O
sleeping O
at O
night O
i O
'll O
just O
sleep O
during O
the O
day O
or O
sleep O
when O
the O
baby O
sleeps O
. O

yeah O
. O

not O
do O
this O
whole O
pumping O
thing O

i O
mean O
if O
i O
had O
to O
do O
it O
all O
over O
that O
's O
what O
i O
would O
do O
. O

oh O
yeah O

because O
i O
was O
thinking O
it O
would O
be O
easier O
because O
then O
other O
people O
could O
feed O
the O
baby O
and O
you O
would O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
so O
tied O
to O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O

and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
go O
out O
to O
a O
movie O
or O
something O
. O

mean O
that O
you O
know O
did O
you O

well O
we O
never O
go O
out O
. O

i O
mean O
you O
know O
what O
norm B-PERSON
and O
i O
are O
like O

i O
mean O
. O

well O
believe O
me O

when O
you O
have O
a O
baby O
you O
'll O
want O
, O
you O
'll O
to O
put O
it O
in O
someone O
else O
's O
house O
or O
someone O
come O
watch O
it O
in O
your O
house O
and O
go O
anywhere O
else O
. O

see O
that O
's O
what O
i O
was O
thinking O
like O
for O
my O
in O
laws O
and O
stuff O
when O
we O
go O
home O
for O
christmas B-DATE
. O

mhm O
. O

it O
would O
be O
so O
nice O
to O
just O
you O
know O
leave O
the O
baby O
with O
them O

but O
you O
ca O
n't O
leave O
the O
baby O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
mean O
if O
you O
, O
you O
know O
y- O
you O
might O
have O
to O
try O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
before O
you O
find O
one B-CARDINAL
that O
works O

but O
yeah O
. O
once O

and O
you O
know O
they O
have O
like O
things O
and O
like O
can O
set O
the O
tension O
or O
whatever O

they O
get O
suck O
suck O
power O
. O

the O
tension O

they O
're O
like O
the O
little O
knob O
on O
your O
sewing O
machine O
. O

you O
can O
set O
the O
, O
the O
power O
level O
and O
stuff O

and O
and O
it O
g- O

or O
like O
extra O
suck O
for O
just O
starting O
to O
suck O
. O

you O
know O
e- O
it O
's O
like O
you O
once O
you O
get O
used O
it O
i- O

you O
know O
at O
first O
you O
feel O
like O
what O
am O
i O
doing O
putting O
this O
machine O
on O
me O

it O
's O
disgusting O
or O
obscene O
or O
something O
. O

but O
once O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
it O
was O
%uh O
you O
know O
you O
can O
like O
read O
while O
you O
're O
doing O
it O
. O

it O
was O
like O
boring O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

okay O
. O

and O
what O
does O
it O
go O
into O

like O
a O
little O
plastic O
bag O
**thingy** O
? O

%uh O
well O
the O
thing O
i O
had O
was O
like O
-- O
-- O
like O
you O
screwed O
on O
this O
whole O
motor O
suction O
part O
-- O
uh-huh O
. O
-- O
on O
to O
something O
that O
was O
just O
like O
a O
, O
a O
jar O
bottom O
. O

you O
know O
just O
looked O
like O
a O
screw O
thing O
so O
that O
it O
went O
to O
this O
plastic O
container O
. O

okay O
. O

and O
you O
can O
reuse O
the O
plastic O
container O
? O

and O
then O
what O
i O
would O

so O
then O
you O
so O
you O
throw O
the O
plastic O
bag O
away O
when O
you O
're O
done O

f- O
%um O
%uh O
%uh O

that O
way O
you O
can O
freeze O
them O

so O
you O
know O
we O
'd O
end O
up O

yeah O
. O

there O
was O
sort O
of O
like O
a O
, O
a O
go O
or O
no O
go O
for O
breast O
pumping O

like O
once O
you O
just O
kind O
of O
got O
everything O
going O
it O

pretty O
much O

but O
i O

the O
level O
so O
even O
if O

one B-CARDINAL

i O
can O
tell O
you O

you O
either O

two B-CARDINAL
bags O
or O
you O
'd O
explode O

that O
was O
it O
. O

and O
she O
just O
could O
n't O
quite O
drink O
that O
much O

so O

%mm O
okay O

that O
was O
why O
i O

the O
morning O

the O
morning O

but O
having O
never O
been O
pregnant O
before O
, O
you O
know O
i O
'm O
sure O
erica B-PERSON
has O
like O
no O
idea O

this O
woman O
must O
be O
on O
just O
you O
know O
absolute O
. O

jim B-PERSON
- O
you O
are O
right O
on O
the O

about O
how O

so O
why O
not O
try O
to O
make O

really O
work O
for O
virginia B-GPE
. O

the O
future O
in O

to O
the O
nation O
, O
company O
or O
person O
who O
develops O
the O
alternative O
to O

. O

why O
not O
do O
everything O
we O
can O
to O
assure O
that O
future O
arises O
from O
virginia O
? O

rather O
than O
drilling O
for O

off O
the B-LOC
atlantic I-LOC

, O
we O
should O
be O

you O

and O
, O
you O

the O

they O
could O
double O

why O

by O

andrea B-PERSON

how O
about O

if O
the O
ga B-ORG
repealed O
the O

then O
the O

or O
, O
the O
ga B-ORG
could O
actually O
cut O
the O

and O
you O
would O
keep O
some O

check O
out O
how O

the O

the O
only O
answer O
to O

the O

, O
although O
based O
on O

, O
we O
still O
have O
a O
ways O
to O
go O
. O

a O
well O
- O
used O
economic O
development O
tool O
is O
the O
incubator O
, O
typically O
an O
office O
building O
that O
is O
subdivided O
and O
provides O
subsidized O
rent O
and O
admin O
services O
to O
small O
business O
that O
have O
outgrown O
their O
garage O
or O
bedroom O
, O
but O
are O
too O
small O
for O
leased O
space O
. O

these O
incubators O
typically O
cater O
to O
high O
tech O
or O
`` O
clean O
'' O
service O
businesses O
. O

i O
have O
always O
thought O
we O
should O
consider O
setting O
up O
recycling O
`` O
incubators O
'' O
at O
landfills O
and O
transfer O
stations O
. O

e-waste O
and O
construction O
waste O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
potentially O
profitable O
steams O

and O
nurturing O
small O
recycling O
businesses O
might O
serve O
both O
an O
economic O
development O
good O
and O
a O
public O
good O
. O

a O
person O
with O
a O
pick O
- O
up O
truck O
could O
start O
such O
a O
business O
pretty O
easily O
. O

the O
cost O
of O
a O
trailer O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
and O
a O
covered O
space O
would O
probably O
be O
much O
less O
than O
equivalent O
office O
space O
. O

if O
we O
stimulated O
home O
- O
grown O
markets O
, O
we O
might O
not O
send O
so O
much O
to O
china B-GPE
, O
although O
i O
suppose O
anything O
we O
can O
do O
to O
curb O
the O
trade O
deficit O
might O
be O
considered O
a O
good O
thing O
in O
some O
quarters O
. O

that O
's O
right O
. O

i O
know O
a O
guy O
who O
gets O
surplus O
building O
materials O
sorts O
and O
resells O
it O
. O

i O
've O
bought O
quite O
a O
bit O
from O
him O

and O
he O
apparently O
does O
a O
good O
business O
. O

the O
business O
itself O
is O
somewhat O
trashy O
looking O
. O

it O
appears O
that O
it O
is O
located O
on O
part O
of O
an O
old O
family O
farm O
, O

and O
the O
nearby O
houses O
are O
ones O
that O
have O
been O
spun O
off O
to O
family O
memebers O
. O

but O
if O
anybody O
else O
tried O
to O
duplicate O
it O
, O
i O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anyplace O
in O
my O
county O
where O
it O
would O
be O
allowed O
, O
or O
else O
the O
requirements O
would O
be O
so O
onerous O
it O
could O
n't O
survive O
. O

in O
my O
home O
town O
, O
they O
once O
built O
an O
entire O
tanker O
truck O
for O
the O
fire O
department O
, O
out O
of O
stuff O
that O
came O
from O
the O
dump O
. O

we O
had O
really O
low O
taxes O
. O

the O
dump O
had O
well O
organized O
recycling O
areas O
located O
around O
the O
central O
landfill O
pit O
, O

and O
people O
had O
a O
good O
eye O
for O
things O
that O
others O
might O
want O
. O

recycling O
is O
a O
really O
good O
idea O
, O

but O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
make O
it O
pay O
, O

and O
it O
has O
a O
waste O
stream O
of O
its O
own O
. O

what O
we O
need O
to O
do O
is O
to O
move O
the O
recycling O
process O
forward O
into O
the O
repair O
world O
. O

the O
volkswagen B-ORG
beetle B-PRODUCT
was O
a O
terrible O
car O
, O

but O
it O
was O
eminently O
recyclable O
. O

i O
had O
one B-CARDINAL
for O
almost B-DATE
twenty I-DATE
years I-DATE

and O
at O
the O
end O
there O
was O
n't O
a O
single O
part O
that O
was O
original O
. O

the O
entire O
body O
had O
been O
swapped O
out O
, O
the O
machinery O
several O
times O
, O
and O
the O
running O
gear O
many O
times O
. O

it O
was O
still O
running O
when O
i O
sold O
it O
, O

but O
if O
vdot B-ORG
ever O
checked O
the O
serial O
numbers O
, O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
. O

the O
other O
thing O
we O
need O
to O
do O
is O
expand O
the O
deposit O
idea O
. O

in O
addition O
to O
having O
deposits O
on O
soft O
drink O
bottles O
, O
we O
should O
have O
them O
on O
appliances O
, O
autos O
and O
other O
big O
ticket O
items O
where O
they O
can O
do O
some O
good O
. O

the O
deposit O
would O
flow O
to O
the O
recycler O
who O
is O
the O
final O
user O
: O

this O
would O
make O
recycling O
profitable O
. O

he O
would O
claim O
the O
refund O
from O
the O
manufacturer O
. O

this O
would O
ensure O
that O
the O
user O
of O
a O
product O
pays O
for O
its O
disposal O
, O

and O
manufacturers O
would O
have O
an O
incentive O
to O
keep O
the O
deposit O
money O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
by O
building O
items O
that O
can O
be O
repaired O
rather O
than O
disposed O
of O
. O

in O
the O
case O
of O
foreign O
manufacturers O
, O
the O
recycling O
fee O
would O
haqve O
a O
similar O
effect O
as O
an O
import O
duty O
and O
could O
be O
collected O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
but O
without O
being O
called O
a O
tariff O
. O

why O
do O
some O
localities O
charge O
for O
the O
service O
while O
others O
do O
n't O
? O

just O
curious O
. O

because O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it O
is O
a O
money O
losing O
operation O
, O
or O
at O
most O
marginal O
. O

recall O
the O
story O
of O
mandatory O
newspaper O
recycling O
in O
the O
district B-GPE
. O

as O
a O
political O
city O
, O
they O
created O
so O
much O
waste O
product O
they O
flooded O
the O
market O
. O

if O
you O
want O
to O
look O
down O
the O
road O
, O
think O
about O
what O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
after O
we O
spend O
a B-CARDINAL
few I-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
to O
meet O
the O
chesapeake B-LOC

waste O
water O
restrictions O

where O
are O
we O
going O
to O
put O
all O
the O
sludge O
that O
results O
? O

once O
we O
stop O
putting O
it O
in O
the O
bay B-LOC
, O
we O
are O
going O
to O
have O
to O
put O
it O
on O
the O
land O
. O

then O
we O
will O
have O
regulations O
to O
prevent O
sludge O
runoff O
in O
order O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
pay O
for O
the O
same O
sludge O
creation O
multiple O
times O

eventually O
we O
will O
outlaw O

that O

what O
? O

what O
? O

i O

i O
have O
some O
letters O
for O
you O

i O
do O
n't O

to O
do O
with O
that O
little O
package O
. O

i O
it O
, O
it O
is O
henna O

and O
%um O
i O
do O

no O
you O
know O
what O
i O
think O
you O
should O
do O
. O

dorota B-PERSON
please O
. O

really O
. O

%uh O
. O

the O
package O
of O
henna O
, O
share O
it O
with O
magda B-PERSON
. O

magda B-PERSON

so O
maybe O
i O

welcome O
both O

in O
a O
major O
rebuke O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
to O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
ruled O
that O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
has O
to O
abide O
by O
the B-LOC
geneva I-LOC
convention I-LOC
and O
the O
uniform O
code O
of O
military O
justice O
when O
handling O
detainees O
uh O
and O
ruled O
that O
the O
military O
tribunals O
can O
not O
be O
the O
. O

senator O
mcconnell B-PERSON
in O
addition O
to O
this O
the O
new B-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
editors O
wrote O
in O
reaction O
to O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
's I-ORG
decision O
striking O
down O
the O
military O
tribunal O
set O
up O
to O
private O
detainees O
being O
held O
in O
guantanamo B-FAC
bay O
it O
is O
far O
more O
than O
a O
narrow O
ruling O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
military O
courts O
. O
it O
is O
an O
important O
and O
welcome O
reaffirmation O
that O
even O
in O
times O
of O
war O
the O
law O
is O
what O
the O
constitution O
the O
statuette O
books O
and O
the B-LOC
geneva I-LOC
convention I-LOC
say O
it O
is O
. O
not O
what O
the O
president O
wants O
it O
to O
be O
. O

senator O
in O
a O
broader O
sense O
is O
n't O
this O
a O
a O
real O
rebuke O
out O
of O
repudiation O
of O
the O
broad O
authority O
that O
the O
president O
's O
been O
claiming O
since O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
? O

well O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
most O
importantly O
the O
decision O
did O
not O
require O
the O
president O
to O
release O
the O
prisoners O
at O
guantanamo B-EVENT
. O

nor O
did O
it O
require O
the O
president O
to O
close O
guantanamo B-FAC
. O

correct O
. O

it O
said O
that O
uh O
in O
order O
to O
try O
these O
individuals O
by O
an O
appropriate O
thing O
to O
do O
would O
be O
for O
the O
president O
to O
get O
the O
congress B-ORG
uh O
to O
create O
military O
commission O
. O

or O
there O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
options O
both O
of O
which O
i O
think O
were O
clearly O
unacceptable O
. O

so O
what O
i O
think O
congress B-ORG
will O
be O
doing O
is O
creating O
military O
commission O
. O

and O
second B-ORDINAL
a O
very O
disturbing O
aspect O
of O
the O
decision O
was O
that O
the O
court O
held O
uh O
common O
article B-LAW
three I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
geneva I-LAW
convention I-LAW
applicable O
to O
um O
american B-NORP
service O
men O
. O

and O
this O
means O
that O
american B-NORP
service O
men O
potentially O
can O
be O
accused O
of O
war O
crimes O
. O

i O
think O
congress B-ORG
is O
going O
to O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
that O
as O
well O
when O
it O
enacts O
these O
military O
commissions O
. O

and O
i O
think O
we O
need O
to O
do O
it O
soon O
. O

uh O
and O
so O
we O
'll O
be O
dealing O
with O
that O
in O
the B-DATE
coming I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

you O
you O
have O
time O
? O

you O
won- O
-- O
you O
're O
going O
off O
now O
? O

are O
you O
off O
now O
? O

there O
's O
nothing O
more O
important O
than O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

and O
i O
think O
uh O
we O
will O
have O
to O
act O
on O
this O
very O
soon O
either O
in O
july B-DATE
or O
in O
september B-DATE
certainly O
uh O
in O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

senator O
schumer B-PERSON
will O
this O
be O
a O
bipartisan O
effort O
? O

and O
can O
you O
agree O
on O
the O
fix O
? O

i O
think O
it O
will O
. O

uh O
look O
let O
's O
face O
it O
andrea B-PERSON
. O

the O
world O
is O
a O
different O
place O
. O

and O
in O
this O
war O
on O
terrorism O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
set O
battlefields O
. O

you O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
enemy O
wearing O
uniforms O
. O

so O
to O
change O
things O
that O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

the O
problem O
is O
this B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
has O
felt O
it O
could O
just O
change O
things O
unilateral O
against O
the O
constitution B-LAW
against O
the O
systems O
of O
checks O
and O
balances O
. O

had O
they O
come O
to O
congress B-ORG
a O
few O
years O
on O
this O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
on O
this O
issue O
my O
guess O
is O
they O
would O
have O
gotten O
most O
of O
what O
they O
wanted O
. O

but O
what O
's O
happened O
here O
, O
because O
there O
is O
such O
a O
view O
that O
the O
president O
's O
power O
is O
infinite O
and O
unchecked O
by O
anybody O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
ever O
a O
president O
has O
had O
those O
kinds O
of O
views O
they O
keep O
running O
into O
brick O
walls O
in O
this O
case O
a B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
that O
has O
generally O
been O
sympathetic O
to O
executive O
power O
. O

and O
so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
not O
only O
look O
at O
this O
issue O
. O

we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
other O
issues O
as O
well O
because O
this O
ruling O
undercuts O
some O
of O
the O
other O
things O
the O
president O
has O
done O
. O

but O
on O
giving O
the O
president O
what O
he O
needs O
and O
giving O
our O
country O
what O
we O
need O
to O
fight O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
there O
's O
going O
to O
be O
g- O
agreement O
. O

well O
let O
's O
break O
it O
down O
here O
because O
this O
ruling O
does O
indicate O
to O
some O
human O
rights O
groups O
that O
this O
applies O
to O
the O
prisoners O
in O
secret O
cia B-ORG
prisons O
to O
the O
prisoners O
in O
afghanistan B-GPE
beyond O
guantanamo B-FAC
. O

are O
we O
going O
to O
see O
a O
flood O
of O
habeas O
corpus O
petitions O
now O
senator O
mcconnell B-PERSON
? O

well O
i O
think O
clearly O
we O
've O
got O
to O
act O
. O

and O
i O
'm O
pleased O
to O
hear O
that O
chuck B-PERSON
thinks O
that O
we O
may O
be O
able O
to O
do O
this O
on O
a O
bipartisan O
basis O
. O

i O
think O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
president O
has O
n't O
done O
anything O
with O
regard O
to O
enemy O
combatants O
that O
have O
been O
done O
-- O
that O
had O
n't O
been O
done O
by O
previous O
presidents O
. O

the O
court B-ORG
now O
has O
stepped O
into O
a O
-- O
eh O
eh O
into O
the O
field O
and O
said O
we O
must O
create O
these O
commissions O
. O

well O
we O
're O
happy O
to O
do O
that O
. O

and O
i O
'm O
hopeful O
it O
'll O
be O
done O
on O
a O
bipartisan O
basis O
. O

but O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
're O
going O
to O
pass O
something O
that O
's O
going O
to O
have O
our O
military O
servicemen O
uh O
subject O
uh O
to O
some O
kind O
of O
international O
rules O
. O

of O
course O
not O
. O

but O
we O
are O
signatories O
to O
the B-LAW
geneva I-LAW
conventions I-LAW
. O

why O
should O
n't O
our O
servicemen O
be O
- O

but O
the O
-- O
but O
the O
-- O
but O
the O
enemy O
is O
not O
a O
signatory O
to O
the O
-- O
to O
the O
-- O
to O
the B-LAW
geneva I-LAW
conventions I-LAW
. O

so O
why O
should O
these O
uh O
terrorists O
uh O
be O
subjected O
uh O
to O
something O
they O
're O
not O
signatories O
to O
? O

the O
good O
news O
andrea B-PERSON
is O
that O
the O
court B-ORG
particularly O
breyer B-PERSON
's O
decision O
said O
congress B-ORG
could O
change O
the O
rules O
. O

and O
we O
have O
to O
change O
the O
rules O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
's O
disagreement O
on O
that O
. O

and O
we O
will O
. O

security O
and O
liberty O
have O
a O
tenuous O
and O
careful O
balance O
in O
this O
republic O
. O

it O
changes O
from O
time O
to O
time O
and O
should O
. O

but O
the O
problem O
here O
again O
- O

you O
're O
right O
. O

there O
're O
going O
to O
be O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
court O
petitions O
. O

this O
is O
going O
to O
create O
huge O
discombobulation O
. O

we O
're O
going O
to O
be O
far O
worse O
off O
than O
if O
the O
administration O
had O
come O
to O
congress B-ORG
originally O
and O
gotten O
this O
done O
. O

but O
this O
view O
-- O
and O
i O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
mitch B-PERSON
here O
this O
view O
that O
the O
president O
has O
the O
sole O
right O
based O
on O
a O
-- O
the O
use O
of O
military O
force O
doctrine O
when O
none O
of O
this O
was O
even O
discussed O
or O
mentioned O
is O
the O
wrong O
view O
. O

and O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
said O
it O
. O

andrea B-PERSON
could O
i O
just O
- O

senator O
mcconnell B-PERSON
should O
guantanamo B-FAC
now O
just O
be O
closed O
? O

no O
i O
d- O
i O
i O
- O

because O
it O
's O
just O
been O
such O
a O
black O
eye O
diplomatically O
. O

what O
are O
we O
-- O
what O
are O
we O
going O
to O
do O
with O
these O
people O
? O

i O
mean O
we O
want O
them O
to O
free O
them O
so O
they O
can O
come O
kill O
us O
again O
? O

look O
i O
i O
think O
the O
congress B-ORG
is O
very O
very O
likely O
to O
give O
the O
president O
exactly O
what O
he O
thinks O
he O
needs O
to O
continue O
to O
fight O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

and O
it O
's O
important O
for O
all O
of O
us O
to O
remember O
that O
we O
have O
n't O
been O
attacked O
again O
here O
at O
home O
again O
since O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
. O

that O
's O
not O
an O
accident O
. O

it O
's O
not O
an O
accident O
. O

the O
policies O
that O
we O
've O
pursued O
are O
protecting O
us O
here O
at O
home O
. O

but O
is O
this O
court B-ORG
ruling O
a O
strong O
signal O
to O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
that O
it O
should O
now O
agree O
with O
senator O
mccain B-PERSON
senator O
lindsey B-PERSON
graham I-PERSON
and O
and O
others O
in O
your O
party O
who O
believe O
that O
it O
should O
go O
in O
-- O
go O
along O
with O
the B-LAW
geneva I-LAW
convention I-LAW
in O
terms O
of O
rules O
of O
the O
road O
for O
our O
soldiers O
? O

i O
think O
congress B-ORG
is O
going O
to O
be O
very O
reluctant O
to O
subject O
american B-NORP
military O
people O
to O
potential O
war O
crimes O
uh O
violations O
. O

so O
john B-PERSON
mccain I-PERSON
is O
wrong O
on O
this O
? O

well O
we O
'll O
see O
. O

we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
-- O
w- O
we O
're O
looking O
for O
the O
administration O
's O
advice O
about O
what O
they O
need O
to O
fight O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

my O
guess O
is O
that O
the O
congress B-ORG
is O
very O
likely O
to O
give O
the O
president O
what O
he O
thinks O
he O
needs O
the O
tools O
he O
thinks O
he O
needs O
to O
protect O
us O
here O
at O
home O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
quite O
that O
simple O
. O

i O
think O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
careful O
looking O
again O
at O
what O
certain O
due O
process O
elements O
are O
that O
the O
constitution B-LAW
and O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
has O
required O
in O
the O
past O
. O

but O
giving O
the O
president O
the O
tool O
he O
needs O
yes O
. O

but O
there O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
thing O
that O
ought O
to O
be O
done O
andrea B-PERSON
given O
the O
sweeping O
nature O
of O
this O
decision O
not O
so O
much O
on O
the O
specifics O
of O
what O
can O
be O
done O
but O
on O
how O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
done O
. O

i O
think O
-- O
i O
've O
-- O
i O
've O
sent O
a O
letter O
today O
to O
attorney O
general O
gonzales B-PERSON
asking O
that O
they O
do O
a O
review O
now O
in O
light O
of O
this O
decision O
of O
all O
their O
other O
abrogations O
of O
power O
so O
we O
avoid O
this O
mess O
again O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
later I-DATE
on O
these O
other O
issues O
whether O
it O
's O
wire O
taps O
or O
anything O
else O
where O
the O
administration O
just O
said O
unilaterally O
we O
can O
do O
whatever O
we O
want O
. O

that O
is O
not O
how O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
works O
. O

well O
let O
me O
turn O

though O
the O

now O
the O
resolution O
said O
the B-ORG
house I-ORG
of I-ORG
representatives I-ORG
expects O
the O
cooperation O
of O
all O

in O
protecting O

such O

the B-ORG

representative O
peter B-PERSON
king I-PERSON
a O
republican B-NORP
of O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
said O
if O
there O
is O
another O
terror O

the O

be O
on O

meaning O
on O
the O
editors O
and O
reporters O
of O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
and O
elsewhere O
. O

the O
president O
expressed O
anger O
over O
this O
. O

let O
's O
give O
a O
listen O
to O
that O
. O

the O
disclosure O
of O
this O
program O
is O
disgraceful O
. O

we O
're O
at O
war O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
people O
who O
want O
to O
hurt O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
of I-GPE
america I-GPE
. O

and O
for O
people O
to O
leak O
that O
program O
and O
for O
a O
newspaper O
to O
publish O
it O
does O
great O
harm O
to O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
of I-GPE
america I-GPE
. O

senator O
schumer B-PERSON
on O
january B-DATE
first I-DATE
you O
said O
that O
an- O
about O
an O
earlier O
leak O
regarding O
the O
nsa B-ORG
surveillance O
that O
quote O
whenever O
classified O
information O
is O
leaked O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
an O
investigation O
because O
it O
could O
endanger O
our O
security O
. O

right O
. O

so O
i O
would O
presume O
you O
now O
would O
agree O
with O
the O
president O
that O
this O
leak O
should O
also O
be O
investigated O
. O

well O
it O
certainly O
should O
be O
investigated O
. O

but O
the O
president O
and O
others O
have O
gone O
way O
overboard O
. O

how O
so O
? O

um O
how O
so O
? O

look O
we O
believe O
in O
a O
free O
press O
in O
this O
country O
. O

the O
press O
is O
often O
antagonistic O
or O
uh O
l- O
probing O
of O
people O
in O
power O
. O

we O
all O
do O
n't O
like O
that O
. O

but O
it O
's O
part O
of O
america B-GPE
. O

and O
as O
a O
founding O
father O
said O
when O
they O
first B-ORDINAL
wrote O
the O
constitution B-LAW
true O
to O
this O
day O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
for O
america B-GPE
. O

ther- O
ec- O
there O
are O
exceptions O
. O

one O
is O
if O
it O
harms O
national O
security O
. O

now O
all O
of O
these O
statements O
by O
the O
president O
and O
others O
are O
jumping O
the O
gun O
. O

we O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
harmed O
national O
security O
. O

in O
fact O
i O
've O
been O
on O
the B-ORG
banking I-ORG
committee I-ORG
for O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

it O
is O
broad O
public O
knowledge O
stated O
by O
administration O
officials O
- O

have O
you O
been O
briefed O
on O
this O
? O

i O
have O
not O
been O
briefed O
privately O
on O
this O
program O
. O

but O
we O
've O
had O
people O
come O
before O
the B-ORG
banking I-ORG
committee I-ORG
uh O
publicly O
from O
treasury B-ORG
and O
other O
departments O
. O

and O
this O
is O
-- O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
has O
made O
statements O
, O
others O
have O
made O
statements O
, O
that O
we O
monitor O
and O
track O
terrorist O
financing O
. O

it O
's O
been O
successful O
. O

well O
. O

so O
that O
you O
uh O
look O
at O
the O
reports O
, O
the O
terrorists O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
banks O
as O
much O
. O

so O
to O
jump O
out O
front O
and O
just O
blast O
a O
newspaper O
that O
they O
may O
not O
like O
that O
to O
me O
is O
totally O
wrong O
. O

it O
's O
-- O
it O
's O
the O
guilty O
verdict O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

and O
the O
the O
trial O
. O

mitch O
uh O
pat B-PERSON
roberts I-PERSON
has O
called O
for O
an O
investigation O
. O

fine O
let O
it O
be O
a O
fair O
- O

the O
head O
of O
the B-ORG
senate I-ORG
intelligence I-ORG
committee I-ORG
. O

yeah O
. O

let O
it O
be O
a O
fair O
and O
down O
the O
middle O
investigation O
. O

my O
guess O
it O
will O
find O
that O
national O
security O
was O
not O
compromised O
a O
jot O
. O

well O
let O
me O
pick O
up O
on O
- O

because O
treasury O
secretary O
snow B-PERSON
took O
a O
group O
of O
reporters O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
afghanistan B-GPE
and O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
to O
show O
off O
how O
they O
were O
tracking O
terror O
financing O
. O

so O
senator O
mcconnell B-PERSON
do O
they O
want O
to O
have O
it O
both O
ways O
? O

do O
they O
want O
to O
brag O
about O
their O
success O
record O
in O
tracking O
this O
financing O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
yell O
and O
scream O
about O
the O
reporters O
when O
they O
print O
the O
source O
? O

well O
look O
i O
think O
the O
leaks O
are O
abominable O
. O

and O
printing O
of O
the O
leaks O
is O
certainly O
trouble O
. O

you O
can O
talk O
in O
general O
about O
what O
we O
're O
doing O
without O
revealing O
the O
specifics O
. O

and O
i O
think O
we O
all O
regret O
that O
the O
-- O
uh O
that O
the O
times O
and O
other O
publications O
chose O
to O
do O
that O
. O

and O
uh O
i O
think O
the O
president O
essentially O
had O
it O
correctly O
. O

well O
let O
me O
show O
you O
a O
joint O
statement O
that O
was O
on O
the O
oped O
pages O
of O
both O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
los I-ORG
angeles I-ORG
times I-ORG
yesterday B-DATE
. O

the O
editors O
of O
those O
newspapers O
wrote O
the O
banking O
articles O
did O
not O
dwell O
on O
the O
operational O
or O
technical O
aspects O
of O
the O
program O
but O
on O
its O
sweep O
the O
questions O
about O
its O
legal O
basis O
and O
the O
issues O
of O
oversight O
. O

we O
understand O
that O
honorable O
people O
may O
disagree O
with O
any O
of O
these O
choices O
to O
publish O
or O
not O
to O
publish O
. O

but O
making O
those O
decisions O
is O
the O
responsibility O
that O
falls O
to O
editors O
a O
corollary O
to O
the O
great O
gift O
of O
our O
independence O
. O

it O
is O
not O
a O
responsibility O
we O
take O
lightly O
. O

and O
it O
is O
not O
one O
we O
can O
surrender O
to O
the O
government O
. O

after O
that O
in O
fact O
the O
wall O
street O
journal O
attacked O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
on O
its O
editorial O
pages O
friday B-DATE
. O

so O
this O
was O
clearly O
a O
response O
to O
that O
. O

uh O
even O
though O
the O
journal B-ORG
had O
itself O
published O
uh O
the O
same O
story O
about O
terror O
financing O
in O
its O
news O
columns O
which O
is O
separate O
from O
its O
editorial O
pages O
. O

senator O
mcconnell B-PERSON
has O
the O
administration O
and O
its O
conservative O
supporters O
now O
embarked O
on O
a O
calculated O
campaign O
to O
demonize O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
and O
other O
newspapers O
but O
particularly O
the O
new B-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
as O
a O
political O
calculus O
because O
it O
'll O
help O
in O
the O
midterm O
elections O
? O

look O
eh O
eh O
newspapers O
are O
very O
very O
important O
in O
our O
-- O
in O
our O
country O
. O

the O
media O
is O
important O
. O

and O
we O
have O
a O
free O
press O
. O

but O
the O
press O
is O
not O
responsible O
for O
our O
national O
security O
. O

that O
's O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
president O
and O
the B-ORG
department I-ORG
of I-ORG
defense I-ORG
and O
the O
other O
agencies O
that O
look O
after O
us O
. O

and O
i O
think O
it O
's O
important O
for O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
principle O
outlets O
in O
the O
press O
in O
this O
country O
to O
be O
responsible O
. O

and O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
uh O
this O
publishing O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
information O
is O
helpful O
. O

and O
nor O
do O
i O
think O
it O
is O
necessary O
uh O
in O
um O
doing O
their O
job O
. O

andrea O
let O
me O
say O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
. O

first B-ORDINAL
you O
asked O
about O
a O
double O
standard O
. O

there O
clearly O
is O
a O
double O
standard O
. O

it O
's O
with O
the O
administration O
. O

they O
leak O
things O
they O
want O
to O
leak O
. O

and O
when O
the O
plame B-PERSON
leak O
came O
out O
there O
was O
no O
outrage O
. O

there O
was O
no O
high O
dudgeon O
. O

in O
fact O
regardless O
of O
the O
criminal O
standard O
which O
uh O
special O
prosecutor O
fitzgerald B-PERSON
is O
handling O
it O
's O
clear O
that O
there O
were O
leaks O
. O

there O
's O
been O
no O
punishment O
no O
outcry O
etcetera O
. O

i O
mean O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
it O
both O
ways O
and O
use O
leaks O
when O
you O
want O
to O
and O
do O
n't O
use O
leaks O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

but O
there O
's O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
point O
here O
. O

when O
it O
comes O
to O
difficult O
situations O
and O
clearly O
iraq B-GPE
now O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
and O
uh O
this O
administration O
has O
a O
penchant O
for O
diversion O
and O
scapegoating O
. O

and O
here O
's O
the O
good O
news O
the O
good O
news O
for O
america B-GPE
and O
i O
think O
the O
good O
news O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
in O
the O
war O
on O
terrorism O
where O
afghanistan B-GPE
is O
deteriorating O
right O
now O
. O

and O
i O
think O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
are O
tired O
and O
see O
through O
these O
diversions O
. O

they O
want O
real O
solutions O
. O

they O
want O
real O
progress O
. O

let O
's O
talk O
about O
real O
solutions O
senator O
because O
democrats B-NORP
are O
sharply O
divided O
over O
iraq B-GPE
. O

two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
only O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
senate B-ORG
democrats B-NORP
supported O
the B-LAW
kerry I-LAW
- I-LAW
feingold I-LAW
amendment I-LAW
by O
senators O
kerry B-PERSON
and O
feingold B-PERSON
calling O
for O
an O
immediate O
withdrawal O
. O

you O
were O
not O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O

but O
as O
the O
party O
's O
campaign O
chairman O
for O
the O
senate B-ORG
campaign O
does O
n't O
that O
amendment O
make O
democrats B-NORP
look O
weak O
? O

not O
at O
all O
. O

you O
know O
what O
our O
job O
is O
? O

look O
the O
president O
is O
commander O
in O
chief O
. O

by O
the O
constitution B-LAW
and O
everything O
else O
is O
in O
charge O
of O
iraq B-GPE
. O

he O
got O
us O
in O
there O
. O

he O
's O
got O
to O
figure O
a O
way O
out O
. O

our O
job O
our O
job O
is O
oversight O
. O

our O
job O
is O
holding O
people O
accountable O
. O

so O
wait O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
. O

you O
're O
going O
to O
the O
election O
to O
to O
the O
voters O
in O
november B-DATE
. O

right O
. O

do O
n't O
you O
also O
have O
the O
job O
as O
campaign O
chairman O
for O
democrats B-NORP
of O
presenting O
an O
alternative O
? O

let O
me O
say O
this O
. O

i O
think O
what O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
want O
is O
for O
the O
congress B-ORG
to O
hold O
the O
president O
's O
feet O
to O
the O
fire O
. O

now O
we O
did O
present O
an O
alternative O
the O
one O
that O
a O
vast O
majority O
of O
democrats B-NORP
voted O
for O
including O
some O
who O
voted O
for O
the O
other O
one O
which O
said O
it O
was O
drafted O
by O
senator O
levin B-PERSON
and O
senator O
jack B-PERSON
reed I-PERSON
of O
rhode B-GPE
island I-GPE
. O

and O
it O
basically O
said O
we O
're O
going O
to O
tell O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
in O
a O
period O
of O
time O
not O
public O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
set O
a O
specific O
deadline O
that O
's O
what O
the O
resolution O
did O
n't O
like O
that O
we O
are O
not O
go O
this O
commitment O
is O
not O
open O
- O
ended O
and O
they O
better O
get O
their O
act O
together O
or O
they O
're O
not O
going O
to O
keep O
us O
there O
. O

but O
make O
no O
mistake O
about O
it O
andrea B-PERSON
. O

a O
minority O
party O
in O
the O
congress B-ORG
has O
a O
job O
. O

the O
job O
is O
one O
of O
oversighting O
accountability O
. O

we O
are O
not O
the O
commander O
in O
chief O
. O

we O
are O
not O
in O
charge O
of O
all O
of O
those O
things O
. O

no O
. O

so O
to O
set O
guidelines O
, O
to O
set O
a O
general O
direction O
the O
way O
we O
did O
in O
the B-LAW
reed I-LAW
- I-LAW
levin I-LAW
amendment I-LAW
is O
correct O
. O

i O
think O
what O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
are O
most O
upset O
about O
is O
the O
republican B-NORP
congress B-ORG
is O
not O
holding O
the O
president O
's O
feet O
to O
the O
fire O
at O
all O
. O

with O
all O
due O
respect O
but O
with O
all O
due O
respect O
when O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
politics O
of O
this O
senator O
chris B-PERSON
dodd I-PERSON
who O
has O
said O
he O
's O
considering O
running O
for O
president O
said O
that O
in O
fact O
the O
kenned- O
-- O
excuse O
me O
the B-LAW
kerry I-LAW
- I-LAW
feingold I-LAW
amendment I-LAW
hurts O
rather O
than O
helps O
the B-ORG
democratic I-ORG
party I-ORG
. O

oh O
i O
do O
n't O
buy O
that O
. O

and O
this O
is O
what O
senator O
feingold B-PERSON
said O
to O
tim B-PERSON
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
about O
those O
like O
yourself O
who O
voted O
against O
it O
. O

i O
can O
tell O
you O
the O
one O
thing O
i O
'm O
sure O
of O
tim O
is O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
have O
had O
it O
with O
this O
intervention O
. O

they O
do O
want O
a O
timetable O
for O
bringing O
home O
the O
troops O
. O

and O
the O
fact O
the O
the O
united B-GPE
states I-GPE
senate B-ORG
does O
n't O
get O
it O
should O
n't O
surprise O
you O
. O

so O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
democratic B-NORP
senate B-ORG
is O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
. O

yes O
it O
is O
at O
this O
point O
. O

those O
who O
vote O
against O
bringing O
the O
troops O
home O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

they O
're O
not O
out O
there O
enough O
. O

they O
're O
not O
listening O
to O
the O
people O
. O

how O
do O
you O
go O
to O
the O
-- O
to O
the O
p- O
-- O
the O
to O
the O
people O
in O
november B-DATE
when O
democrats B-NORP
do O
n't O
have O
an O
agreed O
upon O
policy O
in O
iraq B-GPE
? O

very O
s- O
- O

but O
we O
do O
. O

the O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
democrats B-NORP
supported O
the B-LAW
levin I-LAW
- I-LAW
reed I-LAW
resolution I-LAW
which O
called O
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
transition O
and O
said O
tell O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
it O
's O
not O

i O
would O
say O
this O
. O

the O
ball O
if O
you O
're O
talking O
about O
the O
election O
in O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE

all O

this O

that O

are O
going O
to O
pale O
in O
significance O
before O
how O
things O
are O
going O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
every O

shows O
and O
it O

common O
sense O
hold O
the O
president O
responsible O
. O

senator O
mcconnell B-PERSON
let O
me O
ask O
you O
about O
something O
that O
you O
said O
during O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
month I-DATE
of O
the O
war O
back O
in O
april B-DATE
of I-DATE
two I-DATE
thousand I-DATE
three I-DATE
. O

american B-NORP
success O
in O
iraq B-GPE
showed O
that O
armchair O
generals O
and O
new B-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
reporters O
were O
wrong O
in O
their O
assessments O
of O
how O
difficult O
the O
war O
would O
be O
. O

rebuilding O
iraq B-GPE
will O
be O
much O
easier O
than O
rebuilding O
afghanistan B-GPE
he O
said O
because O
iraq B-GPE
has O
a O
well O
educated O
population O
and O
the O
oil O
to O
finance O
reconstruction O
. O

iraq B-GPE
has O
the O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
jewel O
in O
the B-LOC
middle I-LOC
east I-LOC
. O

was O
that O
a O
miscalculation O
on O
your O
part O
reflecting O
what O
the O
administration O
's O
miscalculation O
was O
? O

well O
certainly O
the O
uh O
the O
taking O
of O
iraq B-GPE
was O
went O
as O
expected O
. O

the O
aftermath O
has O
been O
much O
more O
difficult O
. O

the O
fact O
that O
it O
's O
gone O
on O
a O
while O
creates O
the O
kind O
of O
debates O
the O
democrats B-NORP
are O
having O
among O
themselves O
over O
whether O
we O
get O
out O
by O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
or O
get O
out O
by O
next B-DATE
summer I-DATE
or O
begin O
to O
get O
out O
at O
some O
point O
. O

and O
people O
do O
become O
impatient O
. O

but O
it O
's O
important O
to O
remember O
andrea B-PERSON
the O
most O
important O
thing O
. O

we O
have O
n't O
been O
attacked O
again O
here O
since O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
. O

we O
've O
been O
on O
offense O
. O

we O
've O
invaded O
afghanistan B-GPE
invaded O
iraq B-GPE
. O

there O
're O
democratic O
governments O
now O
in O
both O
places O
. O

is O
it O
easy O
there O
? O

no O
it O
is O
n't O
. O

but O
these O
are O
the O
same O
kinds O
of O
people O
who O
attacked O
us O
here O
i- O
in O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
. O

they O
've O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
that O
again O
because O
the O
president O
made O
the O
fundamentally O
correct O
decision O
to O
get O
on O
offense O
. O

and O
we O
've O
gone O
after O
these O
people O
where O
they O
-- O
somewhere O
else O
fighting O
them O
in O
places O
like O
kabul B-GPE
and O
baghdad B-GPE
so O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
have O
them O
again O
in O
washington B-GPE
and O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
. O

i O
think O
that O
's O
been O
a O
fundamentally O
sound O
decision O
. O

i O
think O
we O
're O
succeeding O
. O

let O
me O
briefly O
turn O
to O
immigration O
. O

uh O
gentlemen O
there O
is O
now O
talk O
of O
a O
possible O
compromise O
which O
would O
have O
a O
two B-CARDINAL
step O
process O
where O
you O
would O
delay O
guest O
workers O
for O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
perhaps O
as O
long O
as O
that O
but O
first B-ORDINAL
do O
the O
border O
security O
. O

uh O
senator O
mcconnell B-PERSON
you O
've O
been O
trying O
to O
support O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
. O

but O
is O
this O
something O
where O
you O
and O
the O
senate B-ORG
republicans B-NORP
could O
move O
toward O
the O
house B-ORG
position O
and O
come O
up O
with O
something O
before O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
? O

well O
i O
'd O
rather O
have O
a O
comprehensive O
bill O
than O
not O
. O

and O
i O
think O
it O
needs O
to O
tilt O
toward O
uh O
border O
security O
. O

uh O
we O
're O
in O
the O
process O
of O
beefing O
up O
border O
security O
anyway O
through O
our O
appropriations O
process O
whether O
or O
not O
we O
're O
able O
to O
achieve O
a O
comprehensive O
immigration O
settlement O
. O

but O
we O
're O
better O
to O
have O
this O
bill O
than O
not O
. O

and O
my O
my O
preference O
is O
- O

and O
senator O
schumer B-PERSON
i O
see O
you O
're O
nodding O
in O
agreement O
. O

yeah O
. O

i O
mean O
the O
problem O
here O
mitch B-PERSON
mcconnell I-PERSON
chuck B-PERSON
schumer I-PERSON
george B-PERSON
bush I-PERSON
supported O
the O
bill O
that O
came O
out O
of O
the O
senate B-ORG
. O

but O
you O
ra- O
you O
'd O
rather O
have O
something O
than O
nothing O
. O

it O
's O
a O
tough O
bill O
. O

and O
it O
's O
a O
fair O
bill O
. O

but O
here O
's O
what O
's O
happening O
. O

there O
's O
a O
who- O
-- O
you O
know O
there O
's O
a O
wing O
of O
the B-ORG
republican I-ORG
party I-ORG
that O
does O
n't O
want O
that O
bill O
. O

they O
tend O
to O
be O
more O
in O
the O
house B-ORG
than O
the O
senate B-ORG
. O

and O
they O
're O
trying O
to O
hold O
things O
up O
. O

they O
're O
having O
these O
hearings O
. O

well O
we O
've O
had O
hearing O
hearing O
hearing O
. O

but O
now O
it O
looks O
like O
we O
may O
shortcircuit O
that O
. O

the O
american B-NORP
people O
want O
a O
solution O
. O

senator O
schumer B-PERSON
as O
you O
well O
know O
in O
connecticut B-GPE
your O
colleague O
and O
friend O
and O
former O
vice-presidential O
candidate O
joe B-PERSON
lieberman I-PERSON
has O
a O
heated O
primary O
race O
on O
his O
hands O
against O
anti-war O
candidate O
ned B-PERSON
lamont I-PERSON
. O

now O
let O
me O
show O
you O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
new O
ad O
that O
the O
lamont B-PERSON
campaign O
is O
airing O
which O
morphs O
joe B-PERSON
lieberman I-PERSON
with O
uh O
pictures O
of O
president O
bush B-PERSON
. O

joe B-PERSON
lieberman I-PERSON
on O
the O
iraq B-GPE
war O
. O

we O
are O
now O
at O
a O
point O
where O
the O
war O
in O
iraq B-GPE
is O
a O
war O
of O
necessity O
. O

joe B-PERSON
leiberman I-PERSON
may O
say O
he O
represents O
us O
. O

but O
if O
it O
talks O
like O
george B-PERSON
w I-PERSON
bush I-PERSON
and O
acts O
like O
george B-PERSON
w I-PERSON
bush I-PERSON
it O
's O
certainly O
not O
a O
connecticut B-GPE
democrat B-NORP
. O

okay O
as O
campaign O
chairman O
will O
you O
now O
today B-DATE
commit O
to O
supporting O
whoever O
wins O
that O
democratic B-NORP
primary O
in O
connecticut B-GPE
where O
he O
is O
now O
facing O
that O
t- O
uh O
tough O
challenge O
? O

well O
let O
me O
say O
this O
andrea B-PERSON
. O

harry B-PERSON
reid I-PERSON
myself O
the B-ORG
democratic I-ORG
senate I-ORG
campaign I-ORG
committee I-ORG
in O
this O
primary O
are O
supporting O
joe B-PERSON
lieberman I-PERSON
. O

and O
we O
're O
doing O
everything O
we O
can O
to O
help O
him O
. O

i O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
speculate O
on O
what O
happens O
after O
the O
primary O
because O
we O
believe O
joe B-PERSON
leiberman I-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
win O
. O

and O
it O
i O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
undermine O
my O
candidate O
by O
speculating O
about O
what O
might O
happen O
afterwards O
. O

we O
think O
he O
's O
going O
to O
win O
. O

and O
we O
're O
supporting O
him O
in O
the O
primaries O
. O

you O
're O
supporting O
him O
even O
though O
his O
position O
on O
the O
war O
is O
completely O
contrary O
to O
most O
most O
democrats B-NORP
? O

well O
again O
the B-ORG
democratic I-ORG
party I-ORG
is O
united O
in O
holding O
the O
president O
's O
feet O
to O
the O
fire O
on O
oversight O
. O

but O
why O
wo O
n't O
you O
commit O
today O
to O
supporting O
joe B-PERSON
lieberman I-PERSON
the O
former O
vice-presidential O
nominee O
? O

but O
- O

because O
- O

you O
're O
basically O
saying O
that O
you O
will O
support O
the O
democrat B-NORP
whoever O
wins O
? O

i O
am O
saying O
that O
we O
are O
supporting O
joe B-PERSON
lieberman I-PERSON
in O
the O
primary O
. O

but O
only O
for O
the O
primary O
. O

and O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
speculate O
about O
things O
afterwards O
. O

because O
that O
undermines O
your O
candidate O
. O

we O
're O
supporting O
joe B-PERSON
. O

he O
's O
going O
to O
win O
. O

are O
you O
suggesting O
that O
you O
might O
not O
support O
the O
democratic B-NORP
winner O
? O

as O
as O
i O
said O
i O
am O
not O
going O
to O
speculate O
on O
the O
future O
because O
we O
're O
for O
joe B-PERSON
leiberman I-PERSON
in O
this O
primary O
. O

we O
're O
talking O
about O
what O
the O
definition O
of O
is O
is O
here O
. O

but O
- O

well O
there O
you O
go O
. O

so O
joe B-PERSON
lieberman I-PERSON
up O
through O
the O
primary O
. O

and O
then O
he O
's O
on O
his O
own O
? O

we O
're O
not O
speculating O
after O
the O
primary O
. O

what O
if O
he O
runs O
as O
an O
independent O
? O

we O
're O
not O
speculating O
after O
the O
primary O
. O

it O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
. O

when O
you O
have O
a O
candidate O
you O
're O
supporting O
you O
do O
n't O
say O
what O
happens O
if O
he O
does O
n't O
win O
? O

andrea B-PERSON
? O

yes O
. O

could O
i O
just O
say O
this O
illustrates O
the O
nature O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
democrat B-NORP
's O
problem O
. O

weigh O
weigh O
weigh O
in O
on O
this O
one O
. O

i O
'm O
sure O
you O
'll O
want O
to O
. O

weigh O
in O
. O

joe B-PERSON
lieberman I-PERSON
voted O
against O
all O
of O
their O
cut O
- O
and O
- O
run O
proposals O
all O
of O
them O
. O

he O
supports O
the O
president O
in O
his O
war O
on O
terror O
and O
in O
the O
uh O
iraqi B-NORP
r- O
uh O
chapter O
of O
that O
. O

and O
it O
creates O
a O
real O
dilemma O
. O

the O
democrats B-NORP
are O
obviously O
totally O
divided O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
how O
to O
handle O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

well O
let O
me O
help O
you O
get O
off O
the O
- O

andrea B-PERSON
wait O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
that O
. O

if O
you O
look O
at O
every O
poll O
who O
do O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
have O
more O
faith O
in O
in O
terms O
of O
iraq B-GPE
? O

it O
's O
the O
democrats B-NORP
. O

who O
do O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
- O

do O
they O
want O
to O
see O
a O
change O
in O
direction O
in O
iraq B-GPE
? O

absolutely O
. O

but O
senator O
- O

and O
i O
think O
they O
respect O
the O
fact O
that O
democrats B-NORP
do O
have O
divisions O
and O
are O
debating O
this O
and O
not O
just O
marching O
in O
lockstep O
to O
whatever O
the O
president O
does O
because O
they O
're O
not O
happy O
with O
what O
the O
president O
is O
doing O
. O

this O
debate O
that O
chuck B-PERSON
and O
i O
are O
having O
- O

and O
that O
's O
going O
to O
help O
us O
. O

this O
debate O
that O
chuck B-PERSON
and O
i O
are O
having O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
big O
issue O
in O
the O
fall O
campaign O
. O

we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
this O
debate O
with O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
. O

speaking O
of O

and O
rivalries O
roll B-ORG

you O

which O

very O

well O
is O

it O
true O
that O
in O

this O

that O
no O

let O
's O
look O
at O
what O
they O
wrote O
in O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
about O
this O
. O

wildly O
overblown O
are O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
's O
protests O
that O
the O
press O
revelations O
about O
the O
financial O
monitoring O
program O
may O
tip O
off O
the O
terrorists O
. O

they O
want O
the O
public O
to O
believe O
that O
it O
had O
not O
already O
occurred O
to O
every O
terrorist O
on O
the O
planet O
that O
his O
telephone O
was O
probably O
monitored O
and O
his O
international O
bank O
transfers O
subject O
to O
scrutiny O
. O

how O
gullible O
does O
the O
administration O
take O
the O
adm- O
american B-NORP
citizenry O
to O
be O
? O

bill B-PERSON
safire I-PERSON
does O
the O
press O
have O
an O
obligation O
- O

well O
- O

is O
is O
that O
it O
? O

is O
that O
it O
for O
me O
? O

no O
. O

stand O
by O
. O

i O
want O
to O
ask O
bill B-PERSON
safire I-PERSON
to O
weigh O
in O
on O
this O
. O

well O
here O
we O
are O
- O

bill B-PERSON
does O
the O
press O
have O
an O
obligation O
to O
print O
or O
not O
in O
this O
case O
? O

and O
were O
they O
giving O
away O
state O
secrets O
? O

look O
uh O
i O
do O
n't O
speak O
for O
the O
times B-ORG
. O

i O
've O
been O
in O
the O
times B-ORG
for O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
disagreeing O
with O
times B-ORG
editorial O
policy O
right O
down O
the O
line O
. O

on O
this O
one O
i O
think O
they O
did O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

here O
we O
are O
on O
independence B-EVENT
day I-EVENT
weekend O
two B-DATE
hundred I-DATE
and I-DATE
thirty I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
celebrating O
what O
was O
the O
resistance O
to O
a O
king O
who O
said O
we O
're O
going O
to O
hang O
you O
for O
treason O
. O

and O
here O
we O
have O
a O
long B-GPE
island I-GPE
congressman O
happens O
to O
be O
named O
king B-PERSON
who O
's O
saying O
treason O
and O
put O
these O
reporters O
in O
jail O
. O

uh O
i O
think O
there O
's O
a O
big O
fundamental O
thing O
going O
on O
here O
now O
uh O
and O
an- O
uh O
across O
the O
board O
of O
get O
the O
press O
get O
the O

and O
uh O
look O
i O
used O
to O
write O
speeches O
for O
spiro B-PERSON
agnew I-PERSON
. O

uh O
uh O
uh O
i O
'm O
hip O
to O
this O
stuff O
. O

uh O
and O
uh O
and O
i O
can O
say O
that O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
blip O
. O

uh O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
on O
the O
offensive O
against O
the O
the O
darned O
media O
. O

but O
uh O
in O
the O
long O
view O
of O
history O
it O
's O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O

but O
is O
it O
the O
- O

this O
is O
what O
i O
do O
n't O
get O
. O

the O
people O
who O
killed O
three B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL

atrocities O
every O
day O
in O
iraq B-GPE
are O
evil O
. O

but O
they O
're O
not O
stupid O
. O

and O
i O
do O
n't O
understand O
the O
logic O
that O
says O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
they O
've O
discovered O
something O
they O
did O
n't O
know O
. O

one I-DATE
president O
bush B-PERSON
walked O
into O
the B-FAC

announced O
we O
've O
developed O
a O

we O
're O
putting O
banks O
and O
financial O
institutions O
around O
the O

on O
notice O

we O
'll O
work O
with O
their O

freeze O

uh O
we O

going O

with O
the B-ORG
united I-ORG

the O
eu B-ORG
the O

to O
follow O
this O

but O
john B-PERSON
what O
bill B-PERSON
bennett I-PERSON
would O
say O
to O
you O
is O
that O
they O
did O
n't O
know O
about O
the O
so O
called O
@swift B-ORG
program O
. O

how O
- O

they O
did O
n't O
know O
the O
specifics O
. O

bill O
- O

well O
where O
did O
the- O
-- O
where O
did O
we O
think O
that O
they O
think O
we O
're O
looking O
for O
money O
? O

well O
why O
did O
they O
-- O
why O
did O
they O
get O
caught O
on O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
and I-DATE
three I-DATE
rather O
than O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
earlier I-DATE
when O
the O
program O
was O
announced O
? O

i O
know O
we O
have O
an O
air O
marshals O
program O
. O

but O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
which O
marshal O
is O
on O
which O
plane O
. O

yeah O
we O
established O
a O
democracy O
. O

we O
we O
oppose O
a O
king O
. O

we O
have O
a O
president O
of O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
. O

the O
founders O
let O
me O
go O
back O
two B-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

james B-PERSON
wilson I-PERSON
said O
the O
press O
will O
be O
free O
. O

no O
prior O
restraint O
on O
the O
press O
. O

however O
when O
they O
err O
, O
when O
they O
are O
irresponsible O
they O
should O
be O
held O
accountable O
. O

now O
you O
put O
richard B-PERSON
clarke I-PERSON
up O
against O
lee B-PERSON
hamilton I-PERSON
and O
tom B-PERSON
kean I-PERSON
. O

i O
'm O
sorry O
. O

richard B-PERSON
clarke I-PERSON
has O
a O
thing O
against O
this O
administration O
. O

that O
's O
pretty O
clearly O
known O
. O

tom B-PERSON
kean I-PERSON
said O
a- O
the O
details O
of O
a O
valuable O
program O
were O
lost O
. O

well O
he O
worked O
for O
a O
while O
in O
this O
administration O
. O

lee B-PERSON
hamilton I-PERSON
said O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

jack B-PERSON
murtha I-PERSON
/. I-PERSON

these O
again O
are O
not O
cat O
's O
paws O
of O
this O
administration O
being O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
not O
to O
run O
this O
piece O
. O

you O
know O
andrea B-PERSON
the O
administration O
every O
time O
there O
's O
a O
national O
security O
story O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
published O
they O
say O
it O
will O
damage O
national O
security O
. O

yes O
dana B-PERSON
? O

but O
they O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
they O
've O
never O
given O
us O
any O
proof O
. O

they O
say O
it O
will O
stop O
cooperation O
. O

but O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
world O
understand O
that O
they O
have O
to O
cooperate O
on O
counter-terrorism O
. O

and O
just O
like O
the O
banks O
that O
did O
not O
pull O
out O
of O
the O
system O
other O
countries O
continue O
to O
cooperate O
. O

but O
dana B-PERSON
- O

have O
we O
heard O
that O
they O
're O
pulling O
out O
from O
this O
system O
? O

because O
it O
's O
a O
common O
problem O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

dana B-PERSON
let O
me O
point O
out O
that O
the B-ORG
washington I-ORG
post I-ORG
your O
newspaper O
was O
behind O
the O
others O
but O
also O
did O
publish O
this O
story O
. O

and O
a O
story O
you O
wrote O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
disclosing O
the O
secret O
cia B-ORG
prisons O
won O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
pulitzer I-WORK_OF_ART
prize I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

but O
it O
also O
led O
to O
william B-PERSON
bennett I-PERSON
sitting O
here O
saying O
that O
three B-CARDINAL
reporters O
who O
won O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
pulitzer I-WORK_OF_ART
prize I-WORK_OF_ART
you O
for O
that O
story O
and O
jim B-PERSON
risen I-PERSON
and O
others O
for O
another O
story O
were O
not O
worthy O
of O
an O
award O
but O
rather O
worthy O
of O
jail O
. O

dana B-PERSON
how O
do O
you O
plead O
? O

well O
um O
it O
's O
not O
a O
crime O
to O
publish O
classified O
information O
. O

and O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
things O
mr. O
bennett B-PERSON
keeps O
telling O
people O
that O
it O
is O
. O

but O
in O
fact O
there O
are O
some O
narrow O
categories O
of O
information O
you O
ca O
n't O
publish O
certain O
signals O
communications O
intelligence O
the O
names O
of O
covert O
operatives O
and O
nuclear O
secrets O
. O

now O
why O
is O
n't O
it O
a O
crime O
? O

i O
mean O
some O
people O
would O
like O
to O
make O
casino O
gambling O
a O
crime O
. O

but O
it O
is O
not O
a O
crime O
. O

why O
is O
n't O
it O
not O
a O
crime O
? O

because O
the O
framers O
of O
the O
constitution B-LAW
wanted O
to O
protect O
the O
press O
so O
that O
they O
could O
perform O
a O
basic O
role O
in O
government O
oversight O
. O

and O
you O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
. O

look O
at O
the O
criticism O
that O
the O
press O
got O
after O
iraq B-GPE
that O
we O
did O
not O
do O
our O
job O
on O
wmd O
. O

and O
that O
was O
all O
in O
a O
classified O
arena O
. O

to O
do O
a O
better O
job O
and O
i O
believe O
that O
we O
would O
've O
done O
a O
better O
job O
we O
would O
've O
again O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O
arena O
of O
- O

but O
we O
've O
now O
had O
a O
steady O
drum O
beat O
from O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
all O
week O
about O
this O
as O
you O
've O
pointed O
out O
. O

here O
's O
what O
the O
president O
and O
the O
vice O
president O
have O
been O
saying O
on O
the O
stump O
at O
campaign O
events O
. O

last B-DATE
week I-DATE
the O
details O
of O
this O
program O
appeared O
in O
the O
press O
. O

there O
can O
be O
no O
excuse O
for O
anyone O
entrusted O
with O
vital O
intelligence O
to O
leak O
it O
. O
and O
no O
excuse O
for O
any O
newspaper O
to O
print O
it O
. O

the O
leaks O
to O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
and O
the O
publishing O
of O
those O
leaks O
is O
very O
damaging O
. O

what O
is O
doubly O
disturbing O
for O
me O
is O
that O
not O
only O
have O
they O
gone O
forward O
with O
these O
stories O
but O
they O
've O
been O
rewarded O
for O
it O
for O
example O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
terrorist O
surveillance O
program O
by O
being O
awarded O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
pulitzer I-WORK_OF_ART
prize I-WORK_OF_ART
for O
outstanding O
journalist O
. O

i O
think O
that O
is O
a O
uh O
disgrace O
. O

john B-PERSON
is O
this O
policy O
of O
trying O
to O
use O
the O
press O
as O
a O
whipping O
boy O
uh O
going O
to O
work O
to O
excite O
the O
conservative O
base O
and O
to O
turn O
voters O
out O
in O
the O
midterm O
elections O
? O

well O
republicans B-NORP
certainly O
think O
so O
. O

they O
if O
you O
're O
a O
republican B-NORP
in O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
or O
in O
congress B-ORG
would O
you O
rather O
talk O
about O
immigration O
gas O
prices O
the O
estate O
tax O
all O
the O
things O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
get O
done O
right O
now O
. O

or O
would O
you O
rather O
go O
after O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
on O
the O
guantanamo B-FAC
ruling O
we O
'll O
talk O
about O
that O
later O
and O
make O
hay O
and O
say O
they O
're O
tying O
our O
hands O
in O
the O
war O
on O
terrorism O
? O

it O
's O
obvious O
they O
'd O
rather O
do O
the O
latter O
. O

and O
they O
love O
this O
discussion O
. O

they O
're O
going O
to O
love O
it O
even O
more O
if O
congress B-ORG
takes O
up O
uh O
legislation O
on O
guantanamo B-FAC
. O

this O
is O
-- O
this O
is O
clearly O
no- O
not O
something O
new O
. O

let O
me O
show O
you O
a O
tape O
from O
nineteen B-DATE
ninety I-DATE
two I-DATE
. O

here O
's O
my O
favorite O
bumper O
sticker O
of O
all O
annoy O
the O
medias O
, O
re-elect O
bush B-PERSON
. O

and O
the O
democrats B-NORP
of O
course O
also O
do O
this O
. O

this O
is O
how O
the B-ORG
boston I-ORG
globe I-ORG
covered O
a O
howard B-PERSON
dean I-PERSON
for O
president O
campaign O
rally O
back O
in O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
four I-DATE
. O

dean B-PERSON
told O
a O
crowd O
of O
supporters O
that O
his O
campaign O
was O
a O
struggle O
between O
us O
and O
the O
washington B-ORG
politicians O
and O
the O
established O
press O
. O

bill B-PERSON
safire I-PERSON
what O
does O
this O
remind O
you O
of O
? O

it O
reminds O
me O
of O
a O
piece O
that O
i O
did O
back O
in O
the O
carter B-PERSON
administration O
where O
i O
wrote O
that O
billy B-PERSON
carter I-PERSON
the O
president O
's O
brother O
was O
overheard O
talking O
many O
times O
with O
the B-ORG
libyan I-ORG
embassy I-ORG
. O

uh O
and O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
got O
very O
excited O
about O
that O
. O

why O
? O

because O
they O
said O
the O
libyans B-NORP
did O
n't O
know O
that O
we O
had O
a O
tap O
in- O
on O
that O
-- O
eh O
on O
their O
embassy O
. O

now O
that O
struck O
everybody O
in O
washington B-GPE
as O
totally O
foolish O
because O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
fifty I-DATE
years I-DATE
every O
single O
embassy O
in O
this O
town O
is O
bugged O
. O

uh O
now O
here O
here O
's O
the O
president O
say O
that O
who O
knew O
that O
the O
the O
details O
of O
this O
program O
? O

le- O
le- O
let O
me O
refre- O

now O
let O
me O
-- O
let O
me O
refresh O
all O
of O
our O
memories O
about O
something O
else O
that O
had O
happened O

take O
a O
look O
at O
this O
piece O
of O
film O
. O

in O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE

today O
we O
have O
more O
than O

okay O
. O

now O
whose O
alliterative O
phrase O
was O
nattering O
nabobs O
of O
negativism O
mr. O
safire B-PERSON
? O

well O
uh O
mr. O
agnew B-PERSON
was O
kind O
enough O
to O
credit O
me O
with O
that O
afterwards O
uh O
because O
i O
'm O
an O
alliteration O
nut O
. O

this O
was O
when O
you O
were O
the O
speechwriter O
in O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
. O

uh O
right O
. O

and O
uh O
i O
was O
on O
loan O
to O
uh O
agnew B-PERSON
for O
that O
speech O
. O

i O
did O
n't O
write O
the O

speech O
uh O
pat B-PERSON
buchanan I-PERSON
did O
that O
where O
he O
really O
zapped O
the O

. O

and O
again O
the O
uh O
the O
nixon B-PERSON
administration O
in O
that O
case O
uh O
got O
a O
leg O
up O
. O

and O
people O
said O
hey O
yeah O
we O
're O
angry O
at O
not O
just O
nixon B-PERSON
. O

we O
're O
angry O
at O
the O

. O

and O
we O
're O
angry O
at O
the O

. O

can O
may O
i O
-- O
can O
i O
-- O
can O
i O
- O

so O
the O
point O
is O
still O
-- O
the O
point O
is O
the O
tension O
between O
the O
media O
and O
the O
government O
is O
long O
- O
standing O
. O

and O
that O
's O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

and O
in O
fact O
all O
these O
many O
of O
the O
people O
getting O
up O
to O
lambaste O
the O
media O
now O
are O
also O
people O
that O
we O
talk O
to O
with O
our O
stories O
to O
vet O
our O
stories O
to O
say O
what O
is O
it O
in O
this O
story O
that O
you O
're O
most O
concerned O
about O
? O

you O
mean O
to O
hold O
things O
back O
? O

to O
hold O
things O
back O
. O

in O
the O
prison O
story O
we O
talked O
with O
the O
administration O
. O

no O
one O
in O
the O
administration O
asked O
us O
not O
to O
publish O
the O
story O
. O

in O
fact O
people O
said O
we O
know O
you O
have O
your O

but O
please O
do O
n't O
publish O
the O
names O
of O
the O

where O
the O

so O
there O
is O
a O
reasoned O
dialogue O
that O
often O
goes O
on O
between O
the O

and O
the O
government O
behind O
behind O
all O
this O
. O

that O
was O
not O
the O

with O
the O

that O

can O
i O

i O

i O

i O

you O

i O

i O
can O

i O
can O
make O

well O
please O

alright O
now O

show O
you O
a O
wall B-ORG
street I-ORG
journal I-ORG
editorial O
very O
unusual O
editorial O
that O
was O
uh O
in O
the O
paper O
on O
friday B-DATE
. O

it O
said O
that O
the O
problem O
with O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
is O
that O
millions O
of O
americans B-NORP
no O
longer O
believe O
that O
its O
editors O
would O
make O
those O
calculations O
in O
anything O
close O
to O
good O
faith O
. O

we O
certainly O
do O
n't O
. O

on O
issue O
after O
issue O
it O
has O
become O
clear O
that O
the O
times B-ORG
believes O
the O
us B-GPE
is O
not O
really O
at O
war O
. O

and O
in O
any O
case O
the O
bush B-PERSON
administration O
lacks O
le- O
the O
legitimacy O
to O
wage O
it O
. O

john B-PERSON
i O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
really O
put O
you O
on O
the O
spot O
here O
. O

but O
i O
am O
. O

your O
paper O
's O
news O
columns O
also O
ran O
this O
story O
. O

and O
here O
you O
have O
this O
editorial O
. O

uh O
it O
it O
really O
is O
uh O
a O
really O
sharp O
conflict O
. O

couple O
of O
points O
on O
that O
. O

first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
that O
editorial O
was O
n't O
kidding O
when O
they O
said O
there O
's O
a O
separation O
between O
the O
news O
and O
the O
editorial O
pages O
at O
the B-ORG
wall I-ORG
street I-ORG
journal I-ORG
. O

that O
's O
for O
sure O
. O

same O
with O
us O
. O

se- O
secondly B-ORDINAL
there O
is O
a O
very O
large O
gap O
between O
the O
ideological O
outlook O
and O
philosophy O
of O
the O
new B-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
editorial O
page O
and O
the O
wall B-ORG
street I-ORG
journal I-ORG
editorial O
page O
. O

there O
is O
not O
a O
large O
ideological O
gap O
between O
the O
news O
staffs O
of O
those O
two B-CARDINAL
places O
. O

and O
why O
would O
there O
be O
? O

some O
of O
the O
top O
people O
of O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
were O
hired O
from O
the B-ORG
wall I-ORG
street I-ORG
journal I-ORG
. O

what O
i O
found O
shocking O
about O
the O
editorial O
was O
the O
assertion O
that O
the B-ORG
new I-ORG
york I-ORG
times I-ORG
did O
not O
act O
in O
good O
faith O
in O
making O
that O
judgment O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
anybody O
on O
the O
news O
staff O
of O
the B-ORG
wall I-ORG
street I-ORG
journal I-ORG
that O
believes O
that O
. O

i O
certainly O
do O
n't O
. O

let O
's O
turn O
to O
guantanamo B-FAC
and O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
. O

what O
is O
the O
political O
fallout O
john O
from O
the O
guantanamo B-FAC
decision O
? O

is O
this O
something O
that O
can O
actually O
work O
in O
the O
administration O
's O
favor O
because O
it O
pits O
the O
court B-ORG
according O
to O
the O
talk O
show O
hosts O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
days I-DATE
on O
the O
side O
of O
al B-ORG
- I-ORG
qaeda I-ORG
? O

it O
's O
embarrassing O
uh O
internationally O
. O

it O
isolates O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
. O

it O
's O
a O
setback O
for O
the O
administration O
's O
+philosophly O
philosophy O
. O

politically O
i O
think O
they O
could O
come O
out O
ahead O
on O
this O
in O
part O
because O
as O
we O
just O
heard O
mitch B-PERSON
mcconnell I-PERSON
and O
chuck B-PERSON
schumer I-PERSON
say O
the O
us B-GPE
uh O
congress B-ORG
is O
going O
to O
take O
up O
very O
soon O
legislation O
giving O
the O
president O
this O
authority O
. O

that O
's O
a O
good O
subject O
for O
republicans B-NORP
to O
be O
on O
. O

dana B-PERSON
what O
is O
it O
costing O
us O
diplomatically O
? O

guantanamo B-FAC
. O

huge O
. O

which O
is O
-- O
which O
is O
the O
point O
not O
just O
on O
+guantanamo O
guantanamo B-FAC
but O
all O
of O
these O
programs O
. O

you O
know O
we O
are O
covering O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

it O
's O
a O
classified O
war O
. O

how O
wha- O
why O
are O
we O
covering O
it O
? O

because O
we O
want O
to O
figure O
out O
whether O
the O
government O
is O
going O
to O
achieve O
its O
strategic O
goals O
which O
is O
to O
defeat O
terrorism O
and O
to O
compete O
in O
the O
realm O
of O
ideology O
. O

it O
's O
not O
just O
the O
tactical O
question O
. O

and O
on O
guantanamo B-FAC
this O
has O
cost O
us O
a O
lot O
internationally O
as O
a O
defender O
a O
primary O
defender O
of O
human O
rights O
. O

and O
you O
have O
to O
take O
those O
things O
into O
consideration O
when O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
win O
a O
war O
. O

bill B-PERSON
safire I-PERSON
should O
the O
administration O
take O
this O
as O
a O
cue O
to O
just O
shut O
guantanamo B-FAC
or O
accept O
the O
john B-PERSON
mccain I-PERSON
approach O
now O
towards O
? O

no O
i O
think O
uh O
the O
administration O
should O
follow O
what O
the O
-- O
the O
guideline O
that O
the B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
has O
suggested O
which O
is O
go O
to O
congress B-ORG
and O
and O
get O
some O
kind O
of O
solid O
guidelines O
on O
what O
should O
happen O
. O

wonderful O
thing O
here O
. O

really O
a O
wonderful O
thing O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

here O
's O
a B-ORG
supreme I-ORG
court I-ORG
which O
put O
george B-PERSON
w I-PERSON
bush I-PERSON
in O
the O
presidency O
uh O
only O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
now O
pulling O
him O
up O
short O
and O
saying O
hey O
you O
got O
to O
get O
some O
oversight O
. O

you O
got O
to O
get O
some O
congressional O
backing O
uh O
before O
you O
can O
do O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O

and O
as O
you O
just O
saw O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
program O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
senators O
who O
disagree O
about O
so O
much O
uh O
pretty O
much O
signaled O
you O
bet O
. O

we O
'll O
-- O
first O
we O
'll O
hear O
from O
the O
president O
. O

and O
he O
'll O
backtrack O
. O

and O
he O
'll O
say O
this O
is O
what O
kind O
of O
a O
military O
commission O
we O
need O
. O

and O
they O
'll O
keep O
guantanamo B-FAC
. O

they O
'll O
keep O
uh O
the O
most O
dangerous O
terrorists O
there O
. O

and O
we O
'll O
have O
these O
military O
commissions O
. O

and O
uh O
they O
'll O
set O
a O
good O
pattern O
for O
the O
next O
president O
and O
hopefully O
not O
the O
next O
war O
. O

andrea O
the O
other O
thing O
this O
does O
politically O
is O
underscore O
the O
arguments O
of O
conservatives O
of O
why O
it O
's O
important O
to O
change O
the O
court B-ORG
. O

you O
had O
scalia B-PERSON
thomas B-PERSON
alito B-PERSON
siding O
with O
the O
administration O
. O

and O
the O
administration O
was O
saying O
we O
need O
some O
more O
conservatives O
. O

the O
last O
word O
to O
you O
bill B-PERSON
bennett I-PERSON
. O

we O
only O
have O
about B-TIME
fifteen I-TIME
thirty I-TIME
seconds I-TIME
. O

yeah O
i O
agree O
with O
bill B-PERSON
safire I-PERSON
. O

it O
's O
in O
uh O
in O
congress B-ORG
's O
court O
now O
. O

and O
they O
need O
to O
act O
on O
it O
. O

but O
i O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
bill B-PERSON
safire I-PERSON
that O
the O
press O
has O
a O
right O
not O
to O
give O
testimony O
in O
a O
criminal O
trial O
. O

they O
are O
not O
above O
the O
law O
. O

and O
when O
you O
show O
your O
pentagon B-WORK_OF_ART
papers I-WORK_OF_ART
case O
please O
read O
black- O
justice O
blackmail O
's O
decision O
. O

he O
said O
no O
prior O
restraint O
. O

but O
if O
people O
get O
hurt O
, O
if O
people O
get O
killed O
as O
a O
result O
of O
this O
the O
press O
is O
responsible O
. O

so O
the O
issue O
is O
whether O
people O
are O
hurt O
by O
something O
that O
had O
arguably O
been O
previously O
disclosed O
. O

that O
's O
correct O
. O

i O
disagree O
completely O
. O

you O
're O
not O
above O
the O
law O
. O

i O
will O
respect O
his O
right O
to O
disagree O
. O

okay O
. O

well O
we O
are O
going O
to O
have O
to O
leave O
it O
there O
. O

that O

the O
core O

the O

will O
never O

or O
let O

the O

" O
the O

it O
can O

barely O
regarded O

" O

the O
problem O
is O
whether O
it O
will O
work O
? O

hangzhou B-GPE
belongs O
to O
people O
of O
the O
entire O
nation O
. O

so O
many O
chinese B-NORP
have O
been O
to O
hangzhou B-GPE
. O

the B-FAC
leifeng I-FAC

was O
fallen O
down O
for B-DATE

, O
which O
also O
symbolized O
the O
emancipation O
of O
chinese B-NORP
women O
, O
but O
later O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
was O
invested O
to O
build O
a O
fake O
tower O
standing O
beside O
the B-LOC
west I-LOC
lake I-LOC
. O

a O
tour O
guide O
said O
: O
" O
people O
often O
went O
up O
to O
explore O
the O
relics O
before O
it O

built O
, O
but O
they O
have O
become O
reluctant O
to O
go O
up O
after O
it O
was O
built O
. O
" O

this O
affects O
the B-LOC
west I-LOC
lake I-LOC
, O
reducing O
tourists O
at O
the O
scenic O
spot O
. O

should O
we O
also O
push O
over O
the O
fake O
leifeng B-FAC
tower I-FAC
? O

even O
if O
it O
were O
pushed O
over O
, O
would O
things O
go O
back O
to O
" O
people O
going O
up O
to O

? O
" O

thus O
, O
blasting O
the O
high O

can O
not O
be O
associated O
with O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O

. O

when O
it O

it O

what O
i O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
in O
this O
topic O
is O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
price O
of O
everything O
without O
exception O
. O

is O
it O
theft O
or O
is O
it O
a O
genuine O
increase O
which O
is O
subject O
to O
the O
circumstances O
that O
caused O
the O
increase O
? O

everything O
has O
doubled O
in O
price O
and O
no O
one O
is O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
it O
. O

what O
's O
strange O
is O
that O
when O
i O
asked O
someone O
why O
the O
price O
of O
agricultural O
materials O
has O
increased O
when O
most O
of O
it O
is O
produced O
locally O
, O
he O
answered O
me O
, O
" O
visit O
the O
wholesale O
center O
and O
you O
'll O
discover O
that O
those O
who O
are O
increasing O
the O
prices O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
" O
tapeworms O
" O
who O
raise O
the O
prices O
without O
anyone O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
them O
" O
. O

so O
where O
is O
the B-ORG
ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
trade I-ORG
to O
give O
us O
the O
main O
reason O
for O
these O
increases O
in O
all O
goods O
? O

what O
is O
strange O
is O
that O
engine O
oil O
is O
priced O
but O
the O
real O
price O
is O
n't O
anything O
like O
it O
, O
i O
mean O
the O
company O
steals O
in O
broad O
daylight O
. O

one O
of O
the O
oil O
sellers O
told O
me O
that O
the O
posted O
price O
is O
just O
a O
suggested O
retail O
price O
and O
not O
the O
real O
price O
and O
that O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
in O
bulk O
to O
get O
the O
real O
price O
. O

so O
who O
is O
responsible O
for O
this O
? O

and O
how O
can O
any O
employee O
with O
a O
salary O
that O
's O
barely O
enough O
to O
live O
on O
cope O
with O
these O
unjustified O
increases O
? O

so O
who O
is O
responsible O
? O

by O
the O
way O
, O
in O
order O
to O
protect O
its O
citizens O
, O
a O
neighboring O
state O
announces O
the O
price O
of O
merchandise O
daily O
over O
the O
radio O
or O
by O
printing O
the O
prices O
in O
one O
of O
the O

. O

so O
what O
is O
the B-ORG

in O
the O

, O
paired O
with O
indications O
that O

have O
caused O

to O
wonder O
why O
the O

so O
grudging O
in O
reducing O

. O

those O

are O
n't O
expressed O
in O
public O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
the O

have O
been O
going O
out O
of O
their O
way O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE

to O
dispel O
any O
impression O
that O
they O
are O
at O

, O

still O
, O
the O

is O
there O
. O

the O
administration O

concerns O
are O
understandable O
. O

the O
economy O
is O
showing O
signs O
of O
weakness O
, O
particularly O
among O
manufacturers O
. O

exports O
, O
which O
played O
a O
key O
role O
in O
fueling O
growth O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE

, O
seem O
to O
have O
stalled O
. O

factory O

fell O
in O
september B-DATE
, O
and O
the O
auto O

are O
in O
a O
severe O
crunch O
. O

but O
mr. O
greenspan B-PERSON
remains O
reluctant O
to O
loosen O
policy O
, O
partly O
because O
he O
faces O
a O
phalanx O
of O
presidents O
of O
regional O
fed B-ORG
banks O
who O
oppose O
credit O
easing O
. O

in O
addition O
, O
the O
chairman O
has O
a O
wary O
eye O
aimed O
a O
year B-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
down O
the O
road O
. O

inflation O
may O
be O
stable O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
running O
at O
about B-PERCENT
4.5 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

but O
if O
the O
fed B-ORG
eases O
too O
soon O
, O
mr. O
greenspan B-PERSON
fears O
, O
prices O
may O
begin O
to O
accelerate O
again O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

moreover O
, O
if O
the O
fed B-ORG
holds O
tight O
, O
it O
may O
be O
able O
gradually O
to O
reduce O
inflation O
, O
moving O
toward O
the O
zero B-CARDINAL
- O
inflation O
goal O
that O
the O
fed B-ORG
chairman O
embraced O
in O
testimony O
to O
congress B-ORG
last B-DATE

. O

so O
far O
, O
mr. O
greenspan B-PERSON
's O
cautious O
approach O
to O
policy O
has O
served O
both O
him O
and O
the O
nation O
well O
. O

his O
hand O
on O
the O
monetary O
tiller O
seems O
one B-CARDINAL
reason O
why O
the O

next B-DATE
month I-DATE
seems O
highly O
likely O
to O
begin O
an B-DATE
unprecedented I-DATE
eighth I-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
peacetime O

without O
a O

`` O

such O

no O

the O

the O
prevailing O
interpretation O

is O
that O
it O
gives O
congress B-ORG
an O
omnipresent O

the O

the O
appropriations O

technically O
a O
limitation O

be O
read O

placing O

the O

powers O
to O
make O
certain O

as O
provided O
by O
article B-LAW

article B-LAW

places O
on O
the O

the O
duty O
to O

`` O

it O
also O
empowers O

: O
`` O

yet O
section B-LAW
605 I-LAW
of O
the O

bill O

'' O

thus O
, O
with O
one O
brief O
passage O
in O
an O
appropriations O

, O
congress B-ORG
repeals O
the O
president O

power O
to O
make O
recess O
appointments O
under O
article B-LAW
ii I-LAW
. O

section B-LAW
605 I-LAW
also O
imposes O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
on O
the O
president O
's O
ability O
to O
nominate O
candidates O
of O
his O
choosing O
. O

the O
language O
of O
the O
appropriations O
rider O
implies O
that O
any O
nomination O
to O
any O
position O
of O
a O
rejected O
nominee O
will O
result O
in O
the O
president O
being O
denied O
funding O
to O
pay O
that O
person O
's O
salary O
. O

the O
president O
could O
probably O
not O
avoid O
this O
restriction O
by O
choosing O
people O
willing O
to O
serve O
without O
pay O
, O
because O
the B-LAW
anti-deficiency I-LAW
act I-LAW
prohibits O
voluntary O
service O
to O
the O
government O
. O

the O
1990 B-DATE
appropriations O
bills O
also O
contain O
a O
number O
of O
`` O
muzzling O
'' O
provisions O
that O
violate O
the O
recommendation O
clause O
in O
article B-LAW
ii I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
constitution I-LAW
. O

muzzling O
provisions O
, O
which O
might O
be O
called O
`` O
blindfold O
laws O
'' O
as O
well O
, O
prevent O
the O
executive O
branch O
from O
even O
looking O
at O
certain O
policy O
options O
, O
let O
alone O
from O
recommending O
them O

congress B-ORG

such O
laws O
violate O
the O
provision O
in O
article B-LAW
ii I-LAW
that O
requires O
the O
president O
to O
make O
recommendations O
to O
congress B-ORG
, O
but O
which O
gives O
the O
president O
the O
discretion O
to O
select O
the O
subject O
matter O
of O
those O
recommendations O
. O

typically O
, O
these O
laws O
seek O
to O
prevent O
executive O
branch O
officials O
from O
inquiring O
into O
whether O
certain O
federal O
programs O
make O
any O
economic O
sense O
or O
proposing O
more O
market O

oriented O
alternatives O
to O
regulations O

probably O
the O
most O
egregious O
example O
is O
a O
proviso O
in O
the O
appropriations O
bill O
for O
the O
executive O
office O
that O
prevents O
the O
president O

scrutiny O

there O
is O
something O
inherently O
suspect O
about O
congress B-ORG

prohibiting O
the O

from O
even O
studying O
whether O

perhaps O
none O
of O
the O
unconstitutional O
conditions O

in O
the O

1990 I-DATE
better O

attempt O

to O
treat O

if O
a O

unworkable O
because O
it O
would O
leave O

the O

be O
a O

an O

announced O
that O
it O
was O
cutting O
off O

entirely O

the O
cause O
is O
said O
to O
be O
that O
a O
french B-NORP
judge O
issued O
an O
international O
warrant O
for O
the O
arrest O
of O
nine B-QUANTITY
important O

twelve B-QUANTITY
years O

the O
rwandan B-NORP
government O
has O
resolutely O
denied O
the O
charge O
, O
while O
the O
international O
community O
has O
likewise O
not O
come O
to O
any O
conclusion O
regarding O
the O
affair O
. O

it O
is O
simply O
that O
the O
families O
of O
the O
french B-NORP
flight O
crew O
have O
brought O
the O
case O
to O
the O
court O
in O
france B-GPE
when O
the O
former O
president O
was O
killed O
and O
thus O
, O
that O
judge O
and O
the O
government O
want O
to O
hold O
their O
own O
law O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
others O
. O

if O
you O
put O
aside O
whether O
the O
evidence O
is O
conclusive O
and O
look O
only O
at O
the O
obstacles O
from O
international O
law O
that O
the O
case O
will O
inevitably O
face O

you O
will O
know O
that O
this O
french B-GPE
faux O

against O
rwanda B-GPE
on O
this O
occasion O
is O
extremely O

about O

a O

general O
abizaid B-PERSON
thanks O
for O
joining O

. O

welcome O
to O
late B-WORK_OF_ART

. O

pleasure O
to O

here O
. O

more O
suicide O

and O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
individuals O

. O

once O
again O
people O
watching O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
iraq B-GPE
have O
to O
ask O
is O
there O
an O
end O
to O
this O
? O

clearly O
there O
is O
an O
end O
to O
this O
. O

that O
the O
end O
comes O
when O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
and O
iraqi B-NORP
governance O
come O
together O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
they O
're O
able O
to O
dominate O
the O
insurgency O
. O

it O
it O
the O
end O
comes O
when O
the O
insurgency O
clearly O
understands O
and O
recognizes O
that O
that O
they O
ca O
n't O
achieve O
any O
progress O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
can O
achieve O
is O
killing O
innocent O
people O
. O

and O
so O
i O
i O
i O
am O
very O
uh O
clear O
in O
my O
understanding O
that O
we O
're O
moving O
in O
a O
good O
direction O
as O
long O
as O
politics O
moves O
forward O
and O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
moves O
forward O
. O

but O
i O
'm O
also O
very O
realistic O
in O
understanding O
that O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
violence O
ahead O
especially O
as O
we O
move O
through O
the O
political O
process O
and O
the O
insurgence O
will O
try O
to O
challenge O
the O
government O
and O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
and O
american B-NORP
forces O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
break O
our O
will O
and O
they O
do O
this O
by O
grabbing O
headlines O
. O

so O
what O
i O
-- O
what O
i O
hear O
you O
saying O
is O
that O
the O
united B-GPE
states I-GPE
military O
alone O
ca O
n't O
crush O
this O
insurgency O
. O

i O
i O
did O
n't O
say O
the O
united B-GPE
states I-GPE
military O
alone O
ca O
n't O
crush O
this O
insurgency O
. O

i O
i O
wanted O
to O
make O
clear O
that O
crushing O
the O
insurgency O
has O
to O
do O
with O
a O
combination O
of O
politics O
economics O
military O
activity O
and O
diplomatic O
activity O
. O

would O
it O
make O
any O
difference O
uh O
let O
me O
rephrase O
the O
question O
if O
the O
us B-GPE
had O
another O
hundred B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
troops O
in O
iraq B-GPE
? O

what O
what O
we O
have O
to O
do O
is O
have O
the O
right O
number O
of O
troops O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

we O
have O
the O
right O
number O
of O
troops O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

we O
have O
to O
build O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
so O
they O
are O
capable O
of O
taking O
the O
lead O
in O
the O
counter-insurgency O
operation O
. O

the O
strategy O
really O
is O
pretty O
simple O
. O

and O
it O
's O
pretty O
elegant O
. O

and O
general O
casey B-PERSON
has O
done O
a O
great O
job O
in O
developing O
it O
. O

we O
develop O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
. O

we O
continue O
to O
give O
them O
experience O
. O

we O
connect O
the O
chain O
of O
command O
. O

we O
build O
good O
leadership O
. O

and O
over O
time O
they O
take O
the O
lead O
in O
the O
counter-insurgency O
fight O
. O

the O
insurgents O
ca O
n't O
beat O
us O
. O

we O
we O
are O
very O
strong O
militarily O
. O

there O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
notion O
out O
there O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
be O
pushed O
into O
the O
sea O
. O

that O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
any O
anything O
even O
close O
to O
what O
you O
might O
see O
. O

but O
i O
i O
i O
assume O
they O
think O
that O
if O
they O
keep O
this O
drum O
beat O
this O
deadly O
series O
of O
suicide O
bombings O
ied's O
improvised O
explosive O
devices O
, O
if O
they O
just O
keep O
killing O
a O
lot O
of O
individuals O
americans B-NORP
and O
iraqis B-NORP
, O
eventually O
the O
american B-NORP
public O
will O
get O
fed O
up O
and O
the O
us B-GPE
will O
pull O
out O
. O

look O
. O

there O
's O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
way O
for O
the O
insurgents O
to O
win O
. O

that O
's O
to O
drive O
us O
out O
before O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
are O
ready O
to O
assume O
the O
battle O
space O
. O

if O
that O
's O
what O
happens O
they O
could O
win O
. O

but O
but O
it O
's O
very O
very O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
stay O
the O
course O
, O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
build O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
capacity O
, O
that O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
are O
serious O
about O
being O
partners O
in O
this O
effort O
and O
they O
're O
very O
serious O
about O
taking O
over O
the O
effort O
. O

the O
insurgents O
ca O
n't O
win O
. O

the O
vice O
president O
dick B-PERSON
cheney I-PERSON
recently O
said O
that O
the O
insurgency O
is O
now O
in O
its O
last O

. O

i O
pressed O
him O
on O
that O
issue O
when O
i O
interviewed O
him O
earlier B-DATE
this I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

here O
was O
his O
response O
in O
part O
. O

if O
you O
look O
at O
what O
the O
dictionary O
says O
about O
throes O
it O
can O
still O
be O
a O
violent O
period O
the O
throes O
of O
a O
revolution O
. O

is O
the O
insurgency O
right O
now O
in O
its O
last O
throes O
? O

the O
insurgency O
is O
in O
a O
no O
- O
win O
position O
. O

the O
insurgency O
can O
cause O
casualties O
. O

they O
can O
grab O
headlines O
. O

but O
as O
long O
as O
the O
politics O
move O
forward O
in O
a O
positive O
direction O
that O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
legitimate O
by O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
people O
and O
as O
long O
as O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
continue O
to O
develop O
at O
the O
rate O
that O
they O
're O
developing O
and O
as O
long O
as O
american B-NORP
forces O
continue O
to O
stay O
there O
to O
provide O
the O
strength O
for O
those O
iraqi B-NORP
forces O
as O
they O
develop O
we O
are O
after O
all O
the O
shield O
behind O
which O
politics O
takes O
place O
the O
insurgency O
wo O
n't O
make O
it O
. O

there O
's O
been O
discussion O
already O
as O
you O
well O
know O
of O
a O
quagmire O
emerging O
in O
iraq B-GPE

senator O

a O

the O

there O

listen O
to O
this O
exchange O
that O
they O
had O
. O

we O
are O
in O
serious O
trouble O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
this O

has O
been O
consistently O

grossly O
mismanaged O

we O

and O
there O
really O
is O
no O
end O
in O
sight O
. O

there O
is O
n't O
a O
person O
at O
this O
table O
who O
agrees O
with O
you O
that O
we O
're O
in O
a O
quagmire O
and O
that O
there O
's O
no O
end O
in O
sight O
. O

give O
us O
your O
assessment O
. O

it O
's O
very O
interesting O
that O
we O
testified O
on O
capital B-LOC
hill I-LOC
for O
about B-TIME
nine I-TIME
hours I-TIME
and O
we O
take O
the O
nine B-TIME
second I-TIME
sound O
bites O
out O
that O
seem O
to O
get O
the O
most O
headlines O
. O

but O
our O
message O
was O
pretty O
clear O
across O
the O
board O
. O

we O
're O
making O
progress O
. O

the O
insurgents O
ca O
n't O
win O
. O

we O
're O
the O
shield O
behind O
which O
politics O
and O
the O
develop O
of O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
will O
take O
place O
and O
eventually O
be O
decisive O
in O
that O
we O
're O
in O
a O
partnership O
with O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
people O
. O

people O
seem O
to O
think O
we O
're O
fighting O
against O
iraqis B-NORP
. O

well O
there O
are O
some O
small O
number O
of O
insurgents O
that O
we O
're O
fighting O
against O
. O

but O
we O
're O
fighting O
with O
a O
lot O
more O
iraqis B-NORP
day O
by O
day O
. O

and O
they O
're O
giving O
their O
lives O
in O
the O
defense O
of O
their O
country O
. O

this O
is O
not O
a O
quagmire O
. O

it O
is O
a O
marathon O
. O

and O
we O
're O
at O
about O
the O
twenty B-ORDINAL
- I-ORDINAL
first I-ORDINAL
mile O
. O

and O
we O
just O
need O
to O
not O
hit O
the O
wall O
. O

we O
need O
to O
get O
through O
till O
the O
end O
. O

how O
many O
insurgents O
are O
there O
? O

during O
the O
testimony O
y- O
y- O
you O
heard O
that O
the O
maximum O
number O
was O
about B-CARDINAL
twenty I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
. O

george B-PERSON
casey I-PERSON
said O
one B-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
tenth I-PERCENT
of I-PERCENT
one I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O

but O
you O
got O
to O
understand O
there O
were O
committed O
people O
. O

there O
are O
people O
that O
support O
the O
insurgency O
. O

when O
politics O
move O
in O
different O
directions O
the O
numbers O
go O
up O
. O

they O
go O
down O
. O

uh O
but O
there O
's O
probably O
about B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
foreign O
fighters O
and O
about O
somewhere B-CARDINAL
less I-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
ten I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
committed O
insurgents O
in O
the O
field O
most O
of O
which O
are O
in O
the O
uh O
mostly O
western O
western O
part O
of O
iraq B-GPE
area O
and O
uh O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
in O
baghdad B-GPE
. O

they O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
. O

they O
can O
cause O
casualties O
. O

they O
do O
n't O
really O
go O
after O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
. O

they O
go O
after O
civilians O
. O

i O
mean O
this O
is O
the O
most O
cynical O
strategy O
i O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

they O
ca O
n't O
be O
successful O
. O

they O
ca O
n't O
win O
. O

the O
uh O
ranking O
democrat B-NORP
on O
the O
senate O
foreign O
relations O
committee O
joe B-PERSON
biden I-PERSON
was O
just O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

he O
came O
back O
gave O
a O
speech O
in O
washington B-GPE
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

he O
said O
of O
the O
hundred B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
so I-CARDINAL
iraqi B-NORP
battalions O
that O
you O
're O
training O
only O
three B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
right O
now O
are O
fully O
capable O
of O
going O
out O
and O
are O
battle O
tested O
and O
battle O
ready O
. O

is O
that O
true O
? O

well O
he O
was O
shown O
a O
chart O
. O

and O
and O
you O
can O
always O
look O
at O
a O
chart O
differently O
. O

and O
the O
chart O
said O
that O
three B-CARDINAL
battalions O
were O
theoretically O
independent O
capable O
of O
independent O
operations O
. O

that O
that O
's O
not O
really O
a O
good O
description O
of O
what O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
armed O
forces O
are O
doing O
. O

up O
in O
the O
north B-LOC
there O
's O
two B-CARDINAL
divisions O
that O
are O
fighting O
in O
the O
area O
. O

there O
's O
a O
division O
that O
are O
fighting O
-- O
that O
is O
fighting O
down O
in O
the O
baghdad B-GPE
area O
. O

they O
there O
is O
a O
growing O
capability O
of O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
to O
be O
more O
and O
more O
effective O
against O
the O
insurgency O
. O

and O
we O
should O
not O
underestimate O
their O
improvement O
. O

on O
the O
other O
hand O
they O
're O
not O
ready O
to O
stand O
alone O
yet O
. O

but O
they O
will O
be O

just O

the O
commander O

military O
central O
command O
general O
john B-PERSON
abizaid I-PERSON
. O

here O
's O
what O
the O
economist O
magazine O
wrote O
about O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
military O
in O
the O
june B-DATE
twentieth I-DATE
issue O
. O

corrupt O
patchily O
trained O
and O
equipped O
often O
abysmally O
led O
and O
devoid O
of O
confidence O
. O

most O
army O
units O
can O
not O
operate O
above O
platoon O
size O
. O

between O
iraqis B-NORP
and O
americans B-NORP
there O
is O
deep O
mistrust O
. O

iraqi B-NORP
units O
billeted O
on O
an O
american B-NORP
bases O
are O
fenced O
off O
from O
their O
host O
as O
a O
security O
measure O
. O

the O
partnership O
that O
exists O
between O
iraqi B-NORP
units O
and O
american B-NORP
units O
is O
certainly O
mu- O
much O
stronger O
and O
much O
more O
robust O
than O
than O
that O
article O
would O
uh O
would O
indicate O
. O

i O
i O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
what O
that O
says O
. O

i O
think O
there O
is O
a O
good O
partnership O
. O

there O
is O
good O
coordination O
in O
the O
field O
. O

and O
more O
iraqis B-NORP
are O
dying O
on O
the O
battle O
field O
fighting O
for O
their O
country O
against O
the O
insurgency O
than O
americans B-NORP
. O

it O
's O
a O
point O
we O
've O
got O
to O
understand O
. O

we O
have O
to O
respect O
them O
for O
fighting O
the O
way O
that O
they O
're O
fighting O
. O

just O
look O
at O
how O
things O
were O
in O
the O
american B-NORP
army O
in O
seventeen B-DATE
seventy I-DATE
five I-DATE
seventeen B-DATE
seventy I-DATE

as O
we O
think O
about O
the O
fourth B-DATE

july I-DATE
holiday O
ahead O
of O
us O
. O

we O
we O
had O
a O
terrible O
time O
getting O
our O
act O
together O
to O
win O
against O
the O
british B-NORP
. O

but O
ultimately O
we O
did O
. O

and O
that O
's O
what O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
with O
the O
iraqi B-NORP
armed O
forces O
as O
well O
. O

they O
need O
time O

they O

. O

that O

what O
we O

giving O
them O
. O

the B-ORG
sunday I-ORG
times I-ORG
of I-ORG
london I-ORG
has O
a O
piece O
today B-DATE
suggesting O
that O
there O
has O
emerged O
a O
dialog O
of O
discussions O
between O
us B-GPE
officials O
and O
iraqi B-NORP
insurgents O
. O

is O
that O
true O
? O

i O
i O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
i O
would O
characterize O
it O
as O
a O
dialog O
between O
us B-GPE
officials O
and O
insurgents O
. O

i O
would O
say O
that O
us B-GPE
officials O
and O
iraqi B-NORP
officials O
are O
looking O
for O
the O
right O
people O
in O
the O
sunni B-NORP
community O
to O
talk O
to O
in O
order O
to O
insure O
that O
the O
sunni B-NORP
arab I-NORP
community O
becomes O
part O
of O
the O
political O
process O
. O

and O
clearly O
we O
know O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
insurgents O
are O
from O
the O
sunni B-NORP
arab I-NORP
community O
. O

it O
makes O
sense O
to O
talk O
to O
them O
. O

we O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
compromise O
with O
zarqawi B-PERSON
. O

uh O
we O
will O
look O
for O
opportunities O
to O
find O
out O
how O
to O
bring O
the O
sunni B-NORP
arab I-NORP
community O
into O
the O
political O
fold O
. O

and O
when O
we O
do O
that O
and O
they O
participate O
in O
a O
peaceful O
way O
i O
think O
iraq B-GPE
will O
really O
start O
moving O
in O
a O
positive O
direction O
. O

i O
i O
i O
sense O
that O
abu B-PERSON
musab I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
zarqawi I-PERSON
terrorist O
number B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
in O
iraq B-GPE
still O
on O
the O
loose O
right O
now O
. O

but O
is O
he O
- O

do O
you O
have O
any O
idea O
where O
he O
is O
? O

we O
we O
certainly O
have O
some O
ideas O
where O
he O
operates O
. O

we O
know O
where O
his O
networks O
are O
. O

we O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
pressure O
on O
his O
networks O
. O

we O
've O
been O
pretty O
successful O
here O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
several I-DATE
months I-DATE
working O
against O
his O
networks O
. O

it O
's O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
for O
zarqawi B-PERSON
. O

can O
you O
give O
us O
a O
sense O
of O
where O
he O
might O
be O
the O
north O
the O
south O
the O
east O
the O
west O
? O

i O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
ever O
serves O
any O
purpose O
when O
a O
military O
commander O
tells O
the O
international O
world O
the O
internal O
community O
where O
a O
particular O
enemy O
might O
be O
. O

i O
i O
think O
uh O
we O
have O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

we O
know O
what O
we O
're O
doing O
in O
our O
efforts O
, O
how O
to O
get O
him O
. O

i O
want O
to O
also O
stress O
that O
it O
's O
not O
about O
one B-CARDINAL
man O
, O
it O
's O
about O
his O
network O
. O

his O
network O
exists O
inside O
iraq B-GPE
. O

it O
's O
connected O
to O
al O
- O
queda O
. O

it O
's O
got O
facilitation O
nodes O
in O
syria B-GPE
. O

it O
brings O
foreign O
fighters O
in O
from O
saudi B-GPE
arabia I-GPE
and O
north B-LOC
africa I-LOC
. O

it O
is O
connected O
to O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
afghanistan B-GPE
and O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
pakistan B-GPE
. O

it O
is O
a O
global O
battle O
that O
we O
face O
. O

the O
zarqawi B-PERSON
part O
of O
the O
network O
needs O
to O
be O
taken O
down O
. O

he O
needs O
to O
be O
captured O
or O
killed O
. O

but O
we O
we O
should O
understand O
it O
's O
a O
long O
war O
ahead O
of O
us O
. O

it O
's O
a O
difficult O
enemy O
that O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
fight O
over O
time O
throughout O
the O
region O
. O

do O
you O
agree O
with O
the O
cia B-ORG
assessment O
and O
a O
recent O
assessment O
that O
the O
terrorist O
training O
ground O
of O
iraq B-GPE
today B-DATE
effectively O
has O
become O
a O
more O
effective O
training O
ground O
for O
al O
- O
queda O
and O
for O
international O
terrorists O
than O
afghanistan B-GPE
under O
the O
taliban B-ORG
ever O
was O
? O

no O
i O
i O
i O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
it O
. O

the O
terrorist O
are O
going O
to O
train O
organize O
operate O
and O
strike O
wherever O
they O
can O
find O
a O
safe O
haven O
. O

they O
they O
are O
certainly O
fighting O
in O
iraq B-GPE
. O

i O
i O
would O
tell O
you O
if O
you O
're O
a O
young O
saudi B-NORP
that O
decides O
to O
volunteer O
for O
the O
jihad O
and O
you O
come O
into O
iraq B-GPE
the O
chances O
are O
extremely O
good O
that O
you O
'll O
never O
come O
back O
from O
iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
so O
the O
mortality O
rate O
for O
foreign O
fighters O
is O
really O
phenomenal O
. O

the O
the O
place O
where O
terrorism O
really O
can O
get O
established O
is O
in O
places O
that O
are O
ungoverned O
spaces O
that O
are O
like O
between O
the O
afghanistan B-GPE
pakistan B-GPE
border O
area O
in O
the O
horn O
of O
africa B-LOC
down O
in O
parts O
of O
the O
arabian B-NORP
principle O
. O

and O
we O
should O
not O
kid O
ourselves O
that O
iraq B-GPE
somehow O
or O
other O
has O
made O
a O
difference O
. O

iraq B-GPE
is O
part O
of O
the O
battle O
. O

it O
's O
central O
in O
the O
battle O
. O

uh O
but O
it O
's O
not O
the O
only O
battle O
. O

is O
it O
time O
to O
reconsider O
women O
american B-NORP
women O
in O
combat O
in O
the O
aftermath O
of O
what O
happened O
this B-DATE
past I-DATE
week I-DATE
? O

more O
american B-NORP
women O
died O
in O
combat O
were O
injured O
i O
believe O
in O
any O
time O
since O
world B-EVENT
war I-EVENT
two I-EVENT
. O

no O
it O
's O
not O
time O
to O
reconsider O
. O

you O
you O
're O
happy O
with O
the O
rules O
that O
exist O
right O
now O
as O
far O
as O
women O
are O
concerned O
? O

ou- O
our O
armed O
forces O
are O
better O
than O
they O
've O
ever O
been O
. O

they O
're O
made O
up O
the O
way O
they O
are O
. O

that O
's O
how O
we O
fight O
. O

that O
's O
how O
we O
do O
our O
business O
. O

we O
need O
to O
keep O
them O
the O
way O
they O
are O

and O
we O
're O
being O
quite O
successful O
. O

the O
cia B-ORG
director O
porter B-PERSON
goss I-PERSON
recently O
said O
he O
has O
an O
excellent O
idea O
where O
osama B-PERSON
bin I-PERSON
laden I-PERSON
is O
. O

do O
you O
? O

we O
have O
a O
clear O
understanding O
of O
where O
the O

i O
would O

about O

i O

and O
i O
'm O
going O
to O
play O
for O
you O
what O
i O
thought O
may O
have O
been O
the O
most O
alarming O
words O
i O
heard O
from O
you O
. O

listen O
to O
this O
. O

when O
my O
soldiers O
say O
to O
me O
and O
ask O
me O
the O
question O
whether O
or O
not O
they O
've O
got O
support O
from O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
or O
not O
that O
worries O
me O
. O

and O
they O
're O
starting O
to O
do O
that O
. O

what O
did O
you O
mean O
by O
that O
? O

we O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
fight O
this O
war O
looking O
over O
our O
shoulder O
worrying O
about O
support O
back O
home O
. O

we O
need O
to O
know O
we O
've O
got O
support O
back O
home O
. O

american B-NORP
soldiers O
fight O
best O
when O
they O
know O
the O
people O
back O
home O
are O
behind O
them O
. O

we O
are O
fighting O
for O
all O
the O
right O
reasons O
against O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
despicable O
and O
dangerous O
enemies O
this O
nation O
has O
ever O
faced O
. O

we O
need O
to O
know O
that O
the O
people O
are O
with O
us O
. O

i O
think O
the O
american B-NORP
public O
strongly O
supports O
the O
troops O
. O

what O
they O
're O
concerned O
about O
is O
the O
war O
. O

the O
most O
recent O
cnn B-ORG
usa B-ORG
today I-ORG
gallup B-ORG
poll O
uh O
showed O
that O
the O
numbers O
have O
gone O
down O
to O
thirty B-PERCENT
nine I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
favor O
the O
war O
in O
iraq B-GPE
compared O
to O
seventy B-PERCENT
one I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
shortly O
after O
major O
combat O
operations O
were O
over O
. O

that O
's O
a O
disturbing O
element O
i O
assume O
for O
you O
as O
far O
as O
the O
demoralization O
of O
the O
us B-GPE
military O
. O

that O
the O
only O
thing O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
wolf B-PERSON
is O
when O
i O
go O
to O
the O
field O
the O
soldiers O
are O
uniformly O
confident O
about O
their O
ability O
to O
face O
this O
enemy O
make O
iraq B-GPE
afghanistan B-GPE
whatever O
area O
they O
happen O
to O
be O
operating O
in O
better O
defeat O
the O
terrorist O
wherever O
they O
find O
them O
and O
they O
all O
understand O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
time O
. O

it O
it O
it O
's O
not O
a O
sprint O
. O

it O
's O
a O
marathon O
. O

we O
need O
people O
to O
understand O
it O
will O
take O
time O
but O
that O
ultimately O
we O
will O
prevail O
. O

one B-CARDINAL
final O
question O
. O

now O
you O
're O
command O
of O
central O

has O
the O
whole O
middle B-LOC

. O

uh O
the O
new O
president O
elected O
of O
iran B-GPE
he O
's O
considered O
a O
hard O
liner O
. O

what O
if O
anything O
from O
the O
military O
's O
perspective O
does O
this O
mean O
for O
the B-GPE
united I-GPE
states I-GPE
? O

i O
i O
'm O
really O
not O
in O
the O
position O
to O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
new O
newly O
elected O
president O
. O

i O
i O
do O
n't O
know O
much O
about O
him O
. O

iran B-GPE
's O
an O
important O
player O
in O
the O
overall O
scheme O
of O
the B-LOC
middle I-LOC
east I-LOC

we O
need O
to O
have O
them O
working O
towards O
stability O
in O
both O
afghanistan B-GPE
and O
iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
we O
're O
hopeful O
that O
under O

that O
they O
'll O
continue O

do O
that O
. O

you O
just O
heard O
general O

say O
that O
the O
us B-GPE
military O
is O
now O
at O
what O
he O
said O
mile O
twenty B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
in O
a O
marathon O
. O

as O
far O
as O
dealing O
with O
the O
insurgency O
in O
iraq B-GPE
there O
are O
twenty B-QUANTITY
six I-QUANTITY
point I-QUANTITY
two I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
in O
a O
marathon O
. O

by O
my O
math O
that O
would O
be O
what O
about O
seventy B-PERCENT
five I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
way O
there O
? O

that O
sounds O
pretty O
upbeat O
. O

yeah O
it O
was O
a O
very O
upbeat O
assessment O
. O

uh O
i O
hope O
it O
's O
realistic O
. O

when O
he O
testified O
in O
front O
of O
us O
it O
did O
n't O
sound O
that O
way O
quite O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

he O
said O
that O
the O
insurgency O
has O
not O
declined O
. O

uh O
he O
said O
that O
there O
's O
an O
increased O
number O
of O
jihadist B-NORP
coming O
across O
the O
border O
into O
iraq B-GPE
to O
fight O
. O

uh O
that O
does O
n't O
sound O
like O
decline O
to O
me O
. O

it O
's O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
dynamic O
which O
i O
think O
we O
ought O
to O
say O
is O
acceptable O
. O

and O
the O
status O
quo O
to O
me O
is O
just O
simply O
not O
working O
. O

and O
we O
've O
got O
to O
change O
the O
current O
dynamic O
in O
a O
number O
of O
ways O
. O

vice O
president O
also O
as O
you O
know O
for O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
several I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
has O
had O
an O
upbeat O
assessment O
. O

i O
want O
you O
to O
listen O
to O
what O
he O
said O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
what O
he O
told O
larry B-PERSON
king I-PERSON
and O
what O
he O
told O
me O
on O
thursday B-DATE
. O

listen O
to O
this O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
excerpts O
from O
the O
vice O
president O
. O

i O
think O
they O
're O
in O
the O
-- O
in O
the O
last O
throes O
if O
you O
will O
of O
the O
insurgency O
. O

we O
've O
- O

if O
you O
look O
at O
what O
the O
dictionary O
says O
about O
throes O
it O
can O
still O
be O
a O
you O
know O
violent O
period O
the O
throes O
of O
a O
revolution O
. O

he O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
backing O
away O
from O
those O
controversial O
comments O
the O
last O
throes O
of O
of O
the O
insurgency O
. O

you O
're O
privy O
to O
all O
the O
intelligence O
as O
both O
the O
member O
of O
the O
armed B-ORG
services I-ORG
and O
the O
intelligence B-ORG
committees O
. O

what O
's O
your O
bottom O
line O
assessment O
? O

well O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
that O
assessment O
of O
the O
vice O
president O
is O
a O
rosy O
colored O
scenario O
. O

just O
the O
way O
going O
into O
iraq B-GPE
was O
rose O
colored O
. O

uh O
when O
he O
relies O
on O
the O
dictionary O
to O
define O
the O
word O
throes O
he O
's O
leaving O
out O
the O
word O
that O
he O
put O
before O
throes O
which O
is O
the O
word O
last O
. O

he O
said O
it O
was O
the O
last O
throes O
of O
the O
insurgency O
. O

and O
i O
think O
he O
's O
got O
to O
just O
have O
his O
eyes O
closed O
to O
what O
the O
reality O
is O
over O
there O
. O

our O
troops O
deserve O
the O
most O
objective O
clearest O
assessment O
that O
they O
can O
possibly O
get O
. O

they O
are O
tremendous O
people O
. O

the O
men O
and O
women O
over O
there O
in O
harm O
's O
way O
deserve O
everything O
we O
can O
provide O
for O
them O
. O

and O
that O
includes O
the O
most O
realistic O
assessment O
we O
can O
give O
them O
. O

to O
suggest O
that O
this O
insurgency O
is O
in O
the O
last O
throes O
flies O
right O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
testimony O
of O
our O
leaders O
which O
was O
given O
to O
us O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
and O
also O
the O
testimony O
for O
instance O
of O
the O
uh O
spokesman O
for O
the O
central O
command O
who O
said O
that O
this O
insurgency O
is O
not O
declining O
and O
that O
the O
number O
of O
jihadist B-NORP
coming O
across O
the O
border O
is O
increasing O
. O

but O
you O
will O
acknowledge O
that O
general O
abizaid B-PERSON
at O
least O
this O
morning B-TIME
here O
on O
late B-WORK_OF_ART
edition I-WORK_OF_ART
seemed O
to O
get O
close O
to O
what O
the O
vice O
president O
is O
saying O
when O
he O
said O
the O
us B-GPE
is O
at O
mile O
twenty B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
in O
a O
twenty B-QUANTITY
six I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
marathon O
. O

alright O
well O
i O
have O
n't O
run O
a O
marathon O
. O

uh O
you O
probably O
can O
see O
that O
uh O
for O
your O
self O
. O

but O
uh O
i O
'm O
not O
a O
marathoner O
. O

but O
nonetheless O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
the B-QUANTITY
last I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
i O
understand O
are O
the O
toughest O
. O

i O
hope O
we O
're O
at O
mile O
twenty B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
. O

but O
i O
've O
got O
to O
tell O
you O
i O
just O
do O
n't O
see O
from O
the O
casualty O
numbers O
which O
continue O
to O
be O
about O
the O
same O
even O
getting O
worse O
. O

and O
what O
general O
abizaid B-PERSON
also O
said O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
was O
that O
as O
long O
as O
the O
political O
process O
keeps O
moving O
along O
that O
then O
there O
's O
some O
real O
hope O
that O
there O
'll O
be O
a O
good O
conclusion O
fairly O
soon O
but O
in O
order O
for O
the O
political O
process O
to O
move O
along O
that O
means O
that O
there O
must O
be O
a O
constitution O
which O
is O
agreed O
upon O
by O
august B-DATE
the I-DATE
fifteenth I-DATE
. O

uh O
there O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
six B-DATE
month I-DATE
extension O
permitted O
. O

but O
that O
's O
it O
. O

there O
's O
a O
timetable O
which O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
have O
set O
for O
themselves O
and O
accepted O
. O

and O
we O
must O
insist O
it O
. O

and O
this O
administration O
must O
insist O
. O

and O
i O
hope O
the O
president O
will O
insist O
on O
tuesday B-TIME
night I-TIME
that O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
live O
up O
to O
that O
timetable O
because O
if O
that O
political O
process O
does O
not O
move O
along O
on O
that O
timetable O
the O
military O
solution O
can O
not O
solve O
this O
problem O
. O

and O
they O
ought O
to O
tell O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
the O
administration O
that O
we O
expect O
them O
to O
live O
up O
to O
that O
timetable O
august B-DATE
fifteenth I-DATE
. O

one B-CARDINAL
six B-DATE

extension O
. O

elections O
. O

first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
approval O
of O
the O
constitution B-LAW
by O
the O
people O
then O
elections O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

and O
they O
should O
be O
told O
that O
we O
can O
not O
make O
an O
open O
- O
ended O
commitment O
to O
you O
. O

we O
can O
not O
stay O
there O
the O
way O
the O
secretary O
of O
state B-ORG
rice B-PERSON
said O
we O
'll O
stay O
there O
as O
long O
as O
they O
need O
us O
. O

that O
is O
too O
open O
- O
ended O
. O

they O
should O
be O
told O
that O
we O
will O
have O
to O
reconsider O
our O
position O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
live O
up O
to O
your O
time O
table O
including O
including O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
american B-NORP
forces O
. O

that O
to O
me O
is O
the O
key O
. O

but O
you O
're O
not O
calling O
for O
a O
timetable O
directly O
right O
now O
as O
some O
other O
democratic B-NORP
and O
even O
a O
few O
republican B-NORP
colleagues O
are O
suggesting O
that O
there O
should O
be O
a O
timetable O
. O

you O
're O
not O
going O
that O
far O
? O

no O
i O
am O
not O
saying O
that O
we O
should O
set O
the O
timetable O
now O
. O

what O
i O
am O
saying O
and O
this O
is O
critically O
important O
is O
that O
we O
should O
tell O
the O
iraqis B-NORP
not O
just O
that O
we O
expect O
them O
to O
live O
up O
to O
their O
own O
timetable O
for O
adopting O
a O
constitution O
but O
that O
if O
they O
do O
not O
live O
up O
to O
that O
timetable O
, O
since O
the O
political O
process O
is O
the O
only O
hope O
for O
defeating O
the O
insurgency O
, O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
live O
up O
to O
their O
own O
timetable O
we O
would O
then O
have O
to O
consider O
all O
options O
including O
but O
not O
limited O
to O
removal O
of O
our O
troops O

rumsfeld I-PERSON
testified O
before O
your O
committee O
other O
committees O
in O
congress B-ORG
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

uh O
i O
want O
you O
to O
listen O
to O
what O
he O
said O
about O
the O
battle O
readiness O
the O
readiness O
of O
iraqi B-NORP
troops O
right O
now O
. O

today B-DATE
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
trained O
battalions O
are O
capable O
of O
conducting O
anti-insurgent O
operations O
albeit O
with O
coalition O
support O
. O

now O
you O
do O
n't O
dispute O
that O
? O

no O
it O
's O
the O
number O
that O
can O
operate O
independently O
which O
is O
just O
a O
few O
. O

that O
's O
the O
key O
issue O
. O

they O
can O
work O
with O
us O
and O
be O
with O
us O
. O

but O
how O
many O
can O
handle O
the O
insurgents O
on O
their O
own O
? O

it O
's O
very O
few O
. O

the O
reports O
that O
have O
been O
printed O
say O
three B-CARDINAL
. O

do O
you O
uh O
want O
the O
defense B-ORG
secretary O
donald B-PERSON
rumsfeld I-PERSON
like O
senator O
kennedy B-PERSON
does O
to O
resign O
? O

i O
think O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
policy O
that O
rumsfeld B-PERSON
is O
implementing O
. O

if O
i O
thought O
his O
resignation O
would O
change O
the O
policies O
and O
would O
help O
to O
change O
the O
course O
and O
change O
the O
dynamic O
then O
i O
would O
favor O
him O
. O

but O
i O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

i O
think O
that O
the O
problem O
here O
that O
we O
've O
had O
right O
from O
the O
beginning O
is O
overly O
optimistic O
predictions O
on O
the O
part O
of O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
we O
attacked O
iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
it O
's O
these O
policies O
which O
need O
to O
be O
changed O
. O

and O
the O
resignation O
does O
not O
effectuate O
the O
change O
in O
policy O
. O

so O
i O
'm O
focusing O
on O
the O
policies O
and O
what O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
to O
change O
those O
policies O
. O

you O
heard O
general O
abizaid B-PERSON
also O
express O
concern O
about O
the O
morale O
if O
you O
will O
of O
the O
us B-GPE
men O
and O
women O
in O
iraq B-GPE
and O
elsewhere O
. O

increasingly O
he O
's O
being O
asked O
questions O
whether O
the O
american B-NORP
people O
are O
behind O
them O
support O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
. O

how O
do O
you O
as O
a O
concerned O
critic O
of O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
war O
in O
iraq B-GPE
deal O
with O
that O
kind O
of O
uh O
situation O
? O

by O
telling O
the O
men O
and O
women O
how O
much O
we O
're O
determined O
to O
support O
them O
as O
long O
as O
they O
're O
there O
that O
we O
're O
also O
determined O
to O
be O
constructive O
critics O
of O
the O
policies O
which O
not O
only O
sent O
them O
there O
as O
un- O
uh O
unequipped O
and O
without O
the O
international O
support O
and O
without O
plans O
for O
the O
aftermath O
. O

uh O
those O
chickens O
are O
coming O
home O
to O
roost O
constantly O
. O

but O
constructive O
critics O
of O
the O
policies O
nonetheless O
are O
totally O
committed O
to O
support O
the O
men O
and O
women O
in O
our O
military O
. O

they O
deserve O
no O
less O
than O
the O
best O
thinking O
the O
most O
realistic O
thinking O
that O
we O
provide O
them O
. O

they O
're O
entitled O
to O
that O
. O

and O
as O
far O
as O
i O
'm O
concerned O
the O
the O
the O
critics O
are O
determined O
that O
this O
time O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
like O
vietnam B-GPE
, O
this O
time O
as O
long O
as O
our O
men O
and O
women O
are O
there O
everything O
we O
possibly O
can O
do O
to O
support O
them O
is O
going O
to O
be O
done O
including O
realistic O
thinking O
and O
constructive O
criticism O
. O

a O
final O
question O
uh O
senator O
. O

on O
the O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
controversy O
that O
erupted O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
the O
deputy O
white B-ORG
house I-ORG
chief O
of O
staff O
said O
this O
in O
new B-GPE
york I-GPE
. O

i O
want O
you O
to O
listen O
. O

conservatives O
saw O
the O
savagery O
of O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
and O
the O
attacks O
and O
prepared O
for O
war O
. O

liberals O
saw O
the O
savagery O
of O
the O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
attacks O
and O
wanted O
to O
prepare O
indictments O
and O
offer O
therapy O
and O
understanding O
to O
our O
attackers O
. O

he O
said O
-- O
uh O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
insists O
he O
was O
referring O
to O
moveon B-ORG
dot I-ORG
org I-ORG
and O
micheal B-PERSON
moore I-PERSON
. O

uh O
what O
do O
you O
say O
in O
response O
to O
what O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
said O
? O

well O
the O
context O
is O
that O
the O
opposition O
to O
this O
administration O
is O
somehow O
or O
another O
weak O
and O
does O
n't O
respond O
to O
terrorism O
. O

i O
thought O
it O
was O
shameful O
. O

they O
ought O
to O
apologize O
for O
it O
. O

president O
ought O
to O
disown O
it O
. O

um O
and O
uh O
it O
is O
-- O
it O
is O
just O
so O
disgraceful O
to O
split O
americans B-NORP
to O
divide O
americans B-NORP
for O
any O
kind O
of O
perceived O
political O
gain O
. O

i O
think O
it O
backfires O
when O
something O
like O
that O
is O
done O
. O

and O
i O
hope O
that O
the O
uh O
president O
would O
disassociate O
himself O
and O
tell O
karl B-PERSON
rove I-PERSON
that O
he O
ought O
to O
be O
ashamed O
of O
himself O
for O
stooping O
to O
that O
level O
to O
divide O
us O
in O
order O
to O
try O
to O
pander O
to O
a O
particular O
audience O
or O
to O
make O
some O
kind O
of O
perceived O
adminis- O
uh O
political O
gain O
. O

thank O
god O
those O
kind O
of O
attacks O

today B-DATE
we O

with O

officials O

and O
just O
a O
short O
while O
ago O
i O
spoke O
with O
president O
lahoud B-PERSON
from O
the O
presidential O
palace O
in O
lebanon B-GPE
. O

mr. O
president O
thanks O
very O
much O
for O
joining O
us O
. O

welcome O
to O
late B-WORK_OF_ART
edition I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

you O
're O
seen O
as O
a O
close O
ally O
of O
syria B-GPE
. O

in O
the O
aftermath O
of O
the O
lebanese B-NORP
elections O
are O
you O
inclined O
to O
move O
lebanon B-GPE
away O
from O
that O
close O
alliance O
with O
syria B-GPE
? O

at O
first O
i O
'd O
like O
to O
say O
that O
there O
are O
historic O
links O
between O
syria B-GPE
and O
lebanon B-GPE
that O
has O
been O
a O
long O
time O
. O

and O
uh O
we O
have O
been O
uh O
on O
very O
friendly O
terms O
for O
long O
time O
. O

and O
if O
you O
look O
at O
the O
of O
lebanon B-GPE
you O
see O
that O
uh O
we O
have O
the O
sea O
and O
we O
have O
syria B-GPE
on O
most O
of O
our O
borders O
and O
uh O
in O
the O
south O
we O
have O
israel B-GPE
. O

so O
we O
have O
to O
be O
on O
very O
good O
terms O
with O
syria B-GPE
and O
continue O
to O
do O
that O
. O

mr. O
president O
uh O
there O
have O
been O
a O
series O
of O
assassinations O
though O
in O
lebanon B-GPE
including O
the O
former O
prime O
minister O
. O

two O
other O
anti-syrian B-NORP
personalities O
were O
assassinated O
in O
recent B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

many O
see O
the O
hand O
of O
the O
syrian B-NORP
government O
behind O
these O
assassinations O
. O

do O
you O
? O

well O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
ones O
that O
did O
this O
assassination O
abominable O
assassination O
uh O
against O
late O
prime O
minister O
are O
the O
enemies O
of O
lebanon B-GPE
. O

and O
they O
want O
to O
do O
harm O
to O
lebanon B-GPE
. O

and O
who O
could O
be O
the O
enemies O
who O
benefited O
from O
that O
? O

for O
sure O
it O
's O
not O
lebanon B-GPE
nor O
syria B-GPE
because O
until O
the O
assassination O
everything O
was O
fine O
, O
the O
stability O
and O
security O
were O
at O
its O
best O
according O
to O
interpol B-ORG
who O
are O
number B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
on O
the O
list O
of O
security O
in O
the O
world O
. O

and O
what O
happened O
made O
us O
uh O
go O
back O
because O
we O
lost O
a O
lot O
by O
it O
and O
i O
'm O
sure O
that O
nobody O
harms O
himself O
. O

so O
it O
could O
n't O
be O
syria B-GPE
nor O
lebanon B-GPE
. O

it O
must O
be O
the O
enemies O
of O
lebanon B-GPE
. O

who O
do O
you O
see O
as O
responsible O
for O
those O
assassinations O
therefore O
? O

well O
it O
could O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
two B-CARDINAL
. O

first B-ORDINAL
we O
had O
troubles O
as O
you O
know O
a O
few O
years O
back O
with O
the O
fundamentalists O
. O

and O
uh O
even O
before O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
we O
had O
uh O
an O
attack O
on O
our O
soldiers O
. O

and O
we O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
. O

and O
we O
had O
to O
react O
. O

and O
we O
put O
them O
in O
prison O
. O

that O
was O
before O
the B-EVENT
nine I-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
. O

eh O
and O
at O
this O
time O
we O
were O
asked O
why O
we O
did O
that O
. O

we O
said O
because O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
unstable O
lebanon B-GPE
. O

and O
eh O
another O
thing O
happened O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
before O
the O
assassination O
of O
president O
. O

and O
that O
was O
when O
uh O
eh O
uh O
they O
tried O
to O
put O
a O
bomb O
in O
the O
uh O
italian B-NORP
embassy O
. O

so O
you O
are O
-- O
are O
you O
accusing O
al O
queda O
mr. O
uh O
mr. O
president O
? O

excuse O
me O
for O
interrupting O
. O

and O
now O
they O
are O
- O

are O
you O
accusing O
al O
queda O
of O
being O
responsible O
? O

i O
can O
say O
it O
's O
a O
fundamentalist O
group O
. O

i O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
they O
belong O
to O
. O

but O
uh O
we O
had O
them O
a O
few O
years O
back O
. O

and O
we O
had O
it O
a O
months O
ago O
. O

they O
are O
fundamentalists O
. O

listen O
to O
what O
-- O
listen O
to O
what O
the O
-- O
listen O
to O
what O
the O
spokesman O
at O
the B-FAC
white I-FAC
house I-FAC
the O
press O
secretary O
scott B-PERSON
mcclellan I-PERSON
said O
on O
june B-DATE
tenth I-DATE
. O

listen O
to O
this O
. O

that O
would O
be O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
. O

there O
are O
reports O
that O
we O
have O
been O
hearing O
about O
for O
some O
time O
about O
a O
syrian B-NORP
hit O
list O
targetting O
key O
lebanese B-NORP
public O
figures O
. O

he O
suggests O
that O
there O
's O
a O
syrian B-NORP
hit O
list O
targetting O
lebanese B-NORP
politicians O
. O

so O
you O
totally O
disagree O
with O
the B-ORG
white I-ORG
house I-ORG
on O
the O
possibility O
that O
syrian B-NORP
intelligence O
may O
be O
responsible O
for O
these O
assassinations O
. O

i O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
syria B-GPE
is O
the O
most O
that O
is O
losing O
uh O
because O
of O
these O
assassinations O
. O

so O
why O
should O
they O
do O
it O
? O

whereas O
as O
i O
said O
the O
fundamentalist O
who O
tried O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
back I-DATE
and O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
before O
the O
assassination O
could O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
suspects O
. O

another O
one B-CARDINAL
could O
be O
our O
permanent O
enemy O
. O

as O
you O
know O
we O
have O
still O
troubles O
in O
the O
south O
. O

and O
it O
could O
be O
that O
they O
are O
trying O
again O
. O

and O
we O
've O
had O
assassinations O
before O
mr. O
. O

we O
had O
an O
ex O
uh O
minister O
. O

we O
had O
. O

we O
had O
. O

and O
at O
the O
time O
israel B-GPE
was O
accused O
. O

so O
why O
now O
? O

they O
're O
trying O
to O
accuse O
lebanon B-GPE
and O
syria B-GPE
. O

a O
lot O
of O
observers O
of O
lebanon B-GPE
blame O
syria B-GPE
's O
interference O
in O
lebanese B-NORP
politics O
over O
the B-DATE
years I-DATE
most O
recently O
getting O
the O
parliament O
to O
extend O
your O
term O
of O
office O
for O
another O
term O
for O
another B-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
as O
being O
responsible O
for O
this O
current O
wave O
of O
anti-syrian B-NORP
attitudes O
reflected O
in O
the O
elections O
that O
have O
occured O
over O
these B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

are O
you O
thinking O
about O
resigning O
? O

for O
sure O
i O
'm O
not O
resigning O
. O

i O
'm O
staying O
until O
the O
end O
of O
my O
term O

and O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
i O
was O
elected O
by O
the O
lebanese B-NORP
parliament O
. O

the O
ex-prime O
minister O
mr. O
uh O
gave O
me O
his O
votes O
as O
well O
. O

so O
why O
do O
they O
say O
that O
it O
was O
the O
syrians B-NORP
that O
did O
that O
? O

it O
was O
in O
a O
free O
will O
by O
the O
members O
of O
parliament O
. O

the O
united B-ORG
nations I-ORG
secretary O

he O
said O
we O

we O

the O

what O

he O
was O
referring O
to O
the O
possibility O
that O

operating O
inside O

even O
though O
the O

well O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
this O
uh O
matter O
eh O
eh O
for O
lebanese B-NORP
the O
hezbollah B-ORG
the O
majority O
of O
lebanese B-NORP
consider O
it O
as O
a O
national O
resistance O
because O
they O
freed O
lebanon B-GPE
of O
israel B-GPE
. O

we O
still O
have O
the O
. O

and O
this O
subject O
you O
can O
not O
do O
it O
by O
force O
. O

it O
must O
have O
a O
consensus O
between O
the O
lebanese B-NORP
. O

and O
the O
lebanese B-NORP
agree O
on O
that O
. O

and O
because O
of O
that O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
lebanese B-NORP
to O
decide O
. O

and O
it O
should O
n't O
be O
done O
by O
force O
. O

all O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
still O
lebanon B-GPE
is O
at O
war O
, O
it O
's O
not O
at O
peace O
. O

as O
you O
know O
we O
still O
have O
problems O
. O

and O
they O
have O
n't O
finished O
. O

one O
of O
them O
is O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
palestinians B-NORP
who O
are O
in O
lebanon B-GPE
. O

and O
this O
is O
a O
very O
grave O
problem O
for O
lebanon B-GPE
. O

lebanese B-NORP
consider O
in O
their O
constitution O
that O
there O
will O
not O
be O
any O
of O
the O
palestinians B-NORP
nor O
there O
will O
be O
any O
partition O
of O
lebanon B-GPE
. O

so O
all O
these O
problems O
have O
n't O
finished O
yet O
. O

so O
it O
's O
up O
to O
the O
lebanese B-NORP
to O
decide O
between O
themselves O
and O
not O
do O
it O
by O
force O
. O

we O
are O
so O
happy O
that O
we O
have O
reached O
the O
stability O
that O
many O
countries O
in O
the O
area O
envy O
us O
. O

so O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
lose O
that O
stability O
. O

all O
we O
say O
is O
that O
we O
are O
in O
to O
know O
what O
will O
the O
un B-ORG
investigation O
team O
concerning O
these O

uh O

what O
's O
so O
good O
about O
this O

it O

one O
of O
the O
four O
great O
classic O

there O
are O
excellent O
parts O

the O

as O
a O

, O
the O
makeup O
of O
characters O
is O
quite O
flawed O

for O

this B-PERSON

, O
with O
all O
her O
loved O

recklessly O
slaughtered O
by O

if O
she O
had O
any O
guts O
at O
all O
, O
she O
should O
have O
fought O
it O
out O
with O
that O
guy O

yet O
she O
became O
sworn O
sister O
with O
her O
enemy O

degraded O
herself O
by O
marrying O
a O
short O
ugly O
man O

what O
is O
the O
hell O
going O

here O

this O
group O

if O

uses O
this O

it O

he O
would O
have O
a O
great O
chance O

going O
down O

who O
now O
dominate O
the O

ibm B-ORG
worries O

, O
unless O

ibm B-ORG
also O

it O

ibm B-ORG
said O
it O

acknowledged O
some O

turned O
down O

but O
it O
said O
that O
was O
mainly O
because O
the O

the B-DATE

. O

ibm B-ORG
said O
it O
thought O
more O

would O
become O

as O
the O

. O

the O
project O
involving O
motorola B-ORG
concerns O
a O

called O

that O
figures O
to O
be O

currently O
, O

produce O
an O

, O
much O
as O
a O

but O
details O

now O
be O
extraordinarily O

and O
the O
wavelengths O

so O
that O
the O

they O
draw O
may O
be O

much O
as O
someone O
using O

would O
have O
trouble O
painting O

x-rays O

straighter O

x-rays O
have O

they O

not O

the O

finally O

the O

all O

: O
who O

who O

it O
is O
not O
my O

either O

mr. O

was O
an O
innocent O
victim O

overzealousness O

even O
if O

reasons O

after O

the O

this O

still O
, O
case O

when O

extends O
the O

who O
ever O
thought O
, O

, O
five B-DATE

six I-DATE

, O
thought O
china B-GPE

take O

the O

to O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
i O
also O
did O
n't O
expect O
it O
, O
so O
i O
discovered O
just O
how O
low O
my O
level O
was O
, O
really O
. O

really O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
i O
really O
did O
n't O
expect O
it O
. O

later O
on O
, O
i O
also O
thought O
about O
this O
, O
that O
i O
had O
n't O
expected O
it O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

because O
at O
the O
outset O
, O
when O
joint O

venture O
brands O
and O
, O
this O
, O
import O
brands O
were O
coming O
in O
, O
what O
everybody O
was O
crowding O
for O
and O
grabbing O
up O
were O
all O
those O
joint O

venture O
brands O
and O
import O
brands O
, O
because O
they O
thought O
the O
quality O
was O
good O
. O

well O
, O
then O
later O
on O
, O
we O
now O
discover O
that O
our O
domestically O
produced O
appliances O
are O
also O
extremely O
good O
. O

not O
only O
do O
we O
use O
them O
ourselves O
, O
but O
we O
also O
export O
them O

that O
is O
