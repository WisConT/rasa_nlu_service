Madeleine B-PERSON
Albright I-PERSON
is O
in O
Paris B-GPE
, O
hoping O
to O
end O
the O
crisis O
. O

She O
meets O
tomorrow B-DATE
with O
Ehud B-PERSON
Barak I-PERSON
and O
Palestinian B-ORG
Authority I-ORG
President O
Yasser B-PERSON
Arafat I-PERSON
. O

They O
're O
expected O
to O
meet O
separately O
with O
Albright B-PERSON
. O

She O
hopes O
to O
bring O
them O
together O
for O
a O
three B-CARDINAL
- O
way O
meeting O
eventually O
. O


Ah O
undoubtedly O
ah O
a O
very O
hasty O
project O
, O
especially O
that O
the B-GPE
Hebrew I-GPE
State I-GPE
tried O
to O
implement O
this O
project O
alone O
, O
from O
the B-LOC
Mediterranean I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
to O
the B-LOC
Red I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
. O

And O
it O
was O
proved O
to O
them O
with O
certainty O
that O
the O
project O
is O
ineffective O
economically O
, O
as O
it O
will O
cost O
one B-MONEY
and I-MONEY
a I-MONEY
half I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

So O
they O
tried O
using O
their O
well O
- O
known O
means O
to O
transfer O
this O
project O
to O
another O
agency O
to O
implement O
it O
and O
finance O
it O
, O
while O
they O
reap O
the O
fruits O
from O
it O
. O

Aha O
, O
aha O
. O

They O
have O
many O
goals O
ah O
for O
such O
a O
project O
, O
the O
most O
important O
of O
which O
is O
to O
build O
one O
hundred O
new O
settlements O
they O
have O
been O
planning O
to O
establish O
in O
the O
Negev B-LOC
. O

Ah O
. O

But O
now O
the O
fear O
is O
that O
they O
plan O
to O
build O
them O
across O
the O
extension O
of O
the O
new O
canal O
line O
from O
the B-LOC
Red I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
to O
the B-LOC
Dead I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
under O
various O
headers O
, O
including O
the O
headers O
ah O
of O
development O
and O
architecture O
and O
ah O
establishing O
new O
settlements O
. O

And O
since O
the O
subject O
has O
become O
open O
in O
Jordan B-GPE
for O
everyone O
, O
there O
is O
no O
guarantee O
that O
the O
new O
construction O
projects O
that O
would O
be O
established O
on O
this O
line O
might O
reach O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
. O

Aha O
. O

And O
they O
might O
repeat O
the O
story O
as O
they O
started O
it O
in O
Palestine B-GPE
by O
building O
settlements O
, O
and O
the O
eastern O
mountains O
will O
become O
occupied O
to O
the O
Dead B-LOC
Sea I-LOC
and O
Araba B-LOC
Valley I-LOC
, O
occupied O
by O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
. O

Aha O
, O
aha O
. O

This O
project O
is O
extremely O
dangerous O
, O
except O
-- O

%pw O
would O
n't O
%pw O
it O
also O
contribute O
to O
completely O
connect O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
and O
Jordanian B-NORP
economy O
to O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
%pw O
, O
I O

what O
generates O
from O
it O
, O
may O
be O

of O
demographic O

economic O
and O
development O
projects O
. O

Yes O
, O
more O
than O
this O
, O
I O
say O
ah O
this O
project O
is O
one O
of O
the O
American B-NORP
- O
Israeli B-NORP
projects O
in O
the O
region O
which O
aim O
in O
the O
end O
at O
incorporating O
ah O
Israel B-GPE
in O
the O
Jordanian B-NORP
society O

in O
the O

they O

then O
Get B-EVENT

I O

A O
tight O

but O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
that O
Jeb B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON

anti-affirmative O
action O
action O
in O
Florida B-GPE
solidified O
women O
and O
people O

basically O
we O

I O
think O
when O
Bush B-PERSON
made O
it O
clear O
that O
he O
wants O
a O
strict O
constructionist O
court O
led O
by O
Scalia B-PERSON
, O
attacked O

tonight B-TIME
so O
far O
. O

Reverend O

, O
it O

going O

, O
however O
late O
we O
're O

and O
whoever O
wins O
it O
, O
that O
it O

going O

be O
so O
thin O
, O
so O
narrow O
, O
that O
it O
will O
be O
a O
victory O
without O
mandate O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
what O
it O
means O
is O
that O
we O
must O
end O
-- O
then O
deal O
with O
some O
consensus O
issues O
. O

For O
example O
, O
should O
there O

Should O
we O

all O
of O
our O

, O
not O
just O

? O

Maybe O

Mrs. O

Commerce B-ORG
Secretary O
Robert B-PERSON

Mr. O

called O
for O
concrete O
results O
by O
next B-DATE
spring I-DATE
in O
negotiations O
over O
fundamental O
Japanese B-NORP
business O
practices O
that O
supposedly O
inhibit O

He O
said O
such O
results O
should O
be O
`` O
measurable O
in O

'' O
in O
reducing O
the O

Mrs. O

at O

of O
the B-ORG
American I-ORG
Chamber I-ORG
of I-ORG

in O
Japan B-GPE
on O
Saturday B-DATE
, O
stressed O
that O
the O
objective O
`` O
is O
not O
to O
get O
definitive O
action O
by O

or O
summer B-DATE
, O
it O
is O
rather O
to O
have O
a O

'' O

She O
added O
that O
she O
expected O
`` O
perhaps O
to O
have O
a O
down O

... O
some O
small O
step O
to O
convince O
the O
American B-NORP
people O

the O
Japanese B-NORP
people O
that O
we O
're O
moving O

'' O

How O
such O

into O
policy O
wo O
n't O
become O
clear O
for O

. O

American B-NORP
and O
Japanese B-NORP
officials O
offered O
several O
theories O
for O
the O
difference O
in O
approach O
betwen O
Mr. O
Mosbacher B-PERSON
and O
Mrs. O
Hills B-PERSON
. O

Many O
called O
it O
simply O
a O
contrast O
in O
styles O
. O

But O
some O
saw O
it O
as O
a O
classic O
negotiating O
tactic O
. O

Others O
said O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
may O
feel O
the O
rhetoric O
on O
both O
sides O
is O
getting O
out O
of O
hand O
. O

And O
some O
said O
it O
reflected O
the O
growing O
debate O
in O
Washington B-GPE
over O
pursuing O
free O
trade O
with O
Japan B-GPE
versus O
some O
kind O
of O
managed O
trade O
. O

Asked O
to O
compare O
her O
visit O
to O
Mr. O
Mosbacher B-PERSON

, O
Mrs. O
Hills B-PERSON
replied O
: O
`` O
I O
did O
n't O
hear O
every O
word O
he O
spoke O
, O
but O
as O
a O
general O
proposition O
, O
I O
think O
we O
have O
a O
very O
consistent O
trade O
strategy O
in O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
. O
'' O

Yet O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
American B-NORP
official O
who O
sat O
in O
with O
her O
during O
three B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
talks O
with O
Japanese B-NORP
officials O
said O
her O
tone O
often O
was O
surprisingly O
`` O
conciliatory O
. O
'' O

`` O
I O
think O
my O
line O
has O
been O
very O
consistent O
, O
'' O
Mrs. O
Hills B-PERSON
said O
at O
a O
news O
conference O
Saturday B-DATE
afternoon B-TIME
. O

`` O
I O
am O
painted O
sometimes O
as O
ferocious O
, O
perhaps O
because O
I O
have O
a O
ferocious O
list O
of O
statutes O
to O
implement O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
feel O
very O
ferocious O

I O
do O
n't O
feel O
either O

I O
feel O
committed O

expanding O

'' O

When O
she O
met O
the O
local O
press O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
on O
Friday B-DATE
, O
Mrs. O
Hills B-PERSON
firmly O
reiterated O
the O
need O
for O
progress O
in O
removing O
barriers O
to O
trade O
in O
forest O
products O
, O
satellites O
and O
supercomputers O
, O
three B-CARDINAL
areas O
targeted O
under O
the O
Super B-LAW
301 I-LAW
provision O
of O
the O
1988 O
trade O
bill O
. O

She O
highlighted O
exclusionary O
business O
practices O
that O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
government O
has O
identified O
. O

But O
her O
main O
thrust O
was O
to O
promote O
the O
importance O
of O
world O
- O
wide O
free O
trade O
and O
open O
competition O
. O

She O
said O
the O
trade O
imbalance O
was O
mainly O
due O
to O
macroeconomic O
factors O
and O
should O
n't O
be O
tackled O
by O
setting O
quantitative O
targets O
. O

At O
her O
news O
conference O
for O
Japanese B-NORP
reporters O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
economics O
journalist O
summed O
up O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
sense O
of O
relief O
. O

`` O
My O
impression O
was O
that O
you O
would O
be O
a O
scary O
old O
lady O
, O
'' O
he O
said O
, O
drawing O
a O
few O
nervous O
chuckles O
from O
his O
colleagues O
. O

`` O
But O
I O
am O
relieved O
to O
see O
that O
you O

gentle O

intelligent O
and O
a O
person O
of O
integrity O

'' O

Mrs. O
Hills B-PERSON
' O
remarks O
did O
raise O
questions O
, O
at O
least O
among O
some O
U.S. B-GPE
officials O
, O
about O
what O
exactly O
her O
stance O
is O
on O
U.S. B-GPE
access O
to O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
semiconductor O
market O
. O

The O
U.S. B-GPE
share O
of O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
market O
has O
been O
stuck O
around O
10 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
for O
years B-DATE
. O

Many O
Americans B-NORP
have O
interpreted O
a O
1986 B-DATE
agreement O
as O
assuring O
U.S. B-GPE
companies O
a O
20 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
share O
by O
1991 B-DATE
, O
but O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
have O
denied O
making O
any O
such O
promise O
. O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
her O
news O
conferences O
, O
Mrs. O
Hills B-PERSON
said O
, O
`` O
I O
believe O
we O
can O
do O
much O
better O
than O
20 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O
'' O

But O
she O
stressed O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
against O
managed O
trade O

I O
will O
not O
enter O

`` O

Most O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
scientists O
taking O
the O
podium O
reported O
results O
with O
new O
, O
more O
sophisticated O
variations O
of O
the O
seemingly O
simple O
electrolysis O
- O
of O
- O
water O
experiments O
described O
last B-DATE
March I-DATE
by O
Messrs. O
Fleischmann B-PERSON
and O
Pons B-PERSON
. O

The O
experiments O
involve O
encircling O
a O
thin O
rod O
of O
palladium O
metal O
with O
a O
wire O
of O
platinum O
and O
plunging O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
electrodes O
into O
`` O
heavy O
'' O
water O
in O
which O
the O
hydrogen O
atoms O
are O
a O
doubly O
heavy O
form O
known O
as O
deuterium O
. O

When O
an O
electric O
current O
is O
applied O
to O
the O
palladium O
and O
platinum O
electrodes O
, O
the O
heavy O
water O
did O
begin O
to O
break O
up O
, O
or O
dissociate O
. O

Ordinarily O
the O
electrolysis O
, O
or O
breakup O
, O
of O
the O
water O
would O
consume O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
electrical O
energy O
. O

But O
Messrs. O
Fleischmann B-PERSON
and O
Pons B-PERSON
said O
their O
experiments O
also O
produced O
large O
amounts O
of O
heat O
. O

The O
heat O
energy O
plus O
the O
energy O
consumed O
by O
the O
breakup O
of O
the O
water O
molecules O
added O
to O
far O
more O
energy O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
apparatus O
than O
electrical O
energy O
going O
in O
, O
they O
reported O
. O

Because O
they O
also O
detected O
tritium O
and O
indications O
of O
nuclear O
radiation O
, O
they O
asserted O
that O
the O
`` O
excess O
'' O
heat O
energy O
must O
be O
coming O
from O
energy O
released O
by O
the O
nuclear O
fusion O
of O
deuterium O
atoms O
inside O
the O
palladium O
rod O
. O

As O
of O
last B-DATE
weekend I-DATE
, O
a O
dozen B-CARDINAL
labs O
also O
have O
reported O
measuring O
`` O
excess O
'' O
heat O
from O
similar O
electrolytic O
experiments O
, O
although O
amounts O
of O
such O
heat O
vary O
widely O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
seven B-CARDINAL
reports O
presented O
here O
of O
excess O
heat O
production O
was O
given O
by O
Richard B-PERSON
A. I-PERSON
Oriani I-PERSON
, O
professor O
of O
chemical O
engineering O
at O
the B-ORG
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Minnesota I-ORG
. O

Mr. O
Oriani B-PERSON
said O
his O
skepticism O
of O
the O
Utah B-GPE
claims O
was O
initially O
confirmed O
when O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
experiments O
last B-DATE
spring I-DATE
failed O
to O
produce O
results O
. O

But O
he O
then O
borrowed O
a O
palladium O
rod O
from O
chemists O
at O
Texas B-ORG
A-AMP-M I-ORG
who O
said O
they O
were O
getting O
excess O
heat O
. O

`` O
The O
results O
were O
fascinating O
, O
'' O
he O
said O
. O

On O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
`` O
run O
'' O
with O
the O
borrowed O
rod O
, O
the O
experiment O
began O
producing O
excess O
heat O
. O

The O
experiment O
was O
stopped O
briefly O
to O
change O
an O
instrument O
. O

When O
it O
was O
restarted O
, O
heat O
output O
`` O
really O
took O
off O
'' O
and O
produced O
excess O
heat O
for O
several B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
dying O
down O
, O
he O
said O
. O

Typical O
of O
other O
experiments O
, O
Mr. O
Oriani B-PERSON
said O
his O
experiment O
was O
`` O
very O
erratic O
. O
'' O

It O
would O
go O
along O
doing O
nothing O
but O
dissociating O
the O
heavy O
water O
and O
then O
at O
totally O
unpredictable O
times O
, O
it O
would O
begin O
producing O
excess O
heat O
for O
as O
long O
as O
10 B-TIME
or I-TIME
11 I-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
quieting O
down O
. O

The O
excess O
heat O
was O
15 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
to I-PERCENT
20 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
more O
than O
the O
energy O
involved O
in O
the O
electrolysis O
of O
water O
. O

Mr. O
Oriani B-PERSON
said O
the O
heat O
bursts O
were O
too O
large O
and O
too O
long O
to O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
sudden O
release O
of O
energy O
that O
might O
have O
slowly O
accumulated O
during O
the O
experiments O
' O
quiescent O
times O
, O
as O
some O
scientists O
have O
suggested O
. O

`` O
There O
is O
a O
reality O
to O
the O
excess O
energy O
, O
'' O
he O
said O
. O

Other O
scientists O
said O
they O
also O
were O
getting O
sporadic O
bursts O
of O
excess O
heat O
lasting O
several B-TIME
hours I-TIME
at O
a O
time O
. O

The O
bursts O
often O
occur O
, O
they O
said O
, O
after O
they O
`` O
perturbed O
'' O
the O
experiments O
by O
raising O
or O
lowering O
the O
amount O
of O
electric O
current O
being O
applied O
, O
or O
switching O
the O
current O
off O
and O
on O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
chemist O
privately O
suggested O
this O
hinted O
that O
some O
`` O
anomalous O
'' O
chemical O
reactions O
might O
be O
producing O
the O
heat O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
reason O
questions O
surround O
the O
heat O
experiments O
is O
that O
they O
involve O
unusually O
meticulous O
measurements O
. O

Typically O
, O
the O
input O
energy O
ranges O
from O
a B-QUANTITY
third I-QUANTITY
of I-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
watt I-QUANTITY
to O
one B-QUANTITY
watt I-QUANTITY
and O
the O
excess O
energy O
is O
measured O
in O
tenths B-QUANTITY
of I-QUANTITY
a I-QUANTITY
watt I-QUANTITY
. O

One B-CARDINAL
exception O
is O
a O
continuing O
experiment O
at O
Stanford B-ORG
University I-ORG
where O
as B-QUANTITY
much I-QUANTITY
as I-QUANTITY
10 I-QUANTITY
watts I-QUANTITY
of O
energy O
are O
being O
put O
into O
the O
electrolytic O
cells O
. O

A O
cell O
filled O
with O
heavy O
water O
is O
producing O
1.0 B-QUANTITY
to I-QUANTITY
1.5 I-QUANTITY
watts I-QUANTITY
more O
heat O
than O
an O
identical O
electrolytic O
cell O
filled O
with O
ordinary O
water O
next O
to O
it O
, O

. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
few O
hints O
the O
excess O
heat O
might O
be O
produced O
by O
fusion O
came O
from O
brief O
remarks O
by O
chemist O
John B-PERSON
Bockris I-PERSON
of O
Texas B-ORG
A-AMP-M I-ORG
University I-ORG
. O

Mr. O
Bockris B-PERSON
previously O
reported O
getting O
bursts O
of O
excess O
heat O
and O
of O
detecting O
increasing O
amounts O
of O
tritium O
forming O
in O
the O
heavy O
water O
. O

He O
said O
that O
within O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
he O
's O
gotten O
evidence O
that O
there O
is O
a O
`` O
weak O
correlation O
'' O
between O
the O
time O
the O
heat O
bursts O
occur O
and O
the O
production O
of O
tritium O
. O

There O
is O
n't O
any O
way O
to O
continuously O
measure O
the O
amount O
of O
tritium O
in O
the O
heavy O
water O
, O
so O
it O
's O
been O
difficult O
to O
tell O
whether O
the O
tritium O
formation O
is O
related O
to O
the O
heat O
bursts O
or O
some O
other O
phenomenon O
. O

Increasingly O
careful O
attempts O
to O
measure O
neutrons O
, O
which O
would O
be O
strong O
evidence O
of O
fusion O
reactions O
, O
continue O
to O
be O
negative O
. O

Messrs. O
Fleischmann B-PERSON
and O
Pons B-PERSON
initially O
reported O
indirect O
evidence O
of O
neutrons O
being O
produced O
in O
their O
experiment O
but O
later O
conceded O
the O
measurements O
were O
questionable O
. O

Researchers O
at O
Sandia B-ORG

Albuquerque B-GPE
, O
N.M. B-GPE

reported O
they O
went O

a O
`` O

three B-CARDINAL

only O

did O
they O
detect O
a O

. O

Shimson B-PERSON
Gottesfeld I-PERSON
of O
Los B-ORG

said O
researchers O
there O
detected O
a O
burst O
of O
neutrons O
from O
an O
early O
cold O
fusion O
experiment O
last B-DATE
April I-DATE
but O
decided O
not O
to O
announce O
it O
until O
they O
could O
confirm O
it O
. O

In O
subsequent O
experiments O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
two B-CARDINAL
neutron O
detectors O
occasionally O
indicated O
a O
burst O
of O
neutrons O
but O
neutron O
bursts O
were O
never O
recorded O
in O
both O
detectors O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

They O
concluded O
the O
indications O
of O
neutrons O
stemmed O
from O
faults O
in O
the O
detectors O
rather O
than O
from O
the O
cold O

At O

Just O
the O

for O
the O

at O

, O
the O
yuppie O
audience O
that O
has O
embraced O
New O

as O
its O
very O
own O
easy O
listening O
. O

But O
you O
ca O
n't O
dismiss O
Mr. O
Stoltzman B-PERSON
's O
music O
or O
his O
motives O
as O
merely O
commercial O
and O
lightweight O
. O

He O
believes O
in O
what O
he O
plays O
, O
and O
he O
plays O
superbly O
. O

His O
recent O
appearance O
at O
the B-ORG
Metropolitan I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
, O
dubbed O
`` O
A B-WORK_OF_ART
Musical I-WORK_OF_ART
Odyssey I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
'' O
was O
a O
case O
in O
point O
. O

It O
felt O
more O
like O
a O
party O
, O
or O
a O
highly O
polished O
jam O
session O
with O
a O
few O
friends O
, O
than O
a O
classical O
concert O
. O

Clad O
in O
his O
trademark O
black O
velvet O
suit O
, O
the O
soft O
- O
spoken O
clarinetist O
announced O
that O
his O
new O
album O
, O
`` O
Inner B-WORK_OF_ART
Voices I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
'' O
had O
just O
been O
released O
, O
that O
his O
family O
was O
in O
the O
front O
row O
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
his O
mother O
's O
birthday O
, O
so O
he O
was O
going O
to O
play O
her O
favorite O
tune O
from O
the O
record O
. O

He O
launched O
into O
Saint B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Saens I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
`` O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Swan I-WORK_OF_ART
'' O
from O
`` O

'' O
a O
favorite O
encore O
piece O
for O
cellists O
, O
with O
lovely O
, O
glossy O
tone O
and O
no O

Then O
, O
as O
if O
to O
show O
that O
he O
could O
play O
fast O
as O
well O
, O
he O
offered O
the O

from O

Sonata B-WORK_OF_ART
for I-WORK_OF_ART

, O
a O
whimsical O
, O
puckish O
tidbit O
that O
reflected O
the O
flip O
side O
of O
the O
Stoltzman B-PERSON
personality O
. O

And O
so O
it O
went O
through O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
half B-CARDINAL
: O
an O
ingeniously O
chosen O
potpourri O
of O
pieces O
, O
none O
longer O
than O
five B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
, O
none O
that O
would O
disturb O
or O
challenge O
a O
listener O

Mr. O
Stoltzman B-PERSON
introduced O
his O
colleagues O
: O
Bill B-PERSON
Douglas I-PERSON

composer O
and O
an O
old O

An O
improvisational O
section O
was O
built O
around O
pieces O
by O
Mr. O

, O
beginning O
with O
`` O

to O
the O
uptempo O

'' O
which O
gave O
Mr. O
Stoltzman B-PERSON
the O
opportunity O
to O
wail O
in O
a O
high O
register O
and O
show O
off O
his O
fleet O
fingers O
. O

Bach B-PERSON

`` O

'' O
followed O
. O

Mr. O
Stoltzman B-PERSON
tied O
the O
composer O
in O
by O
proclaiming O
him O
`` O
the O
great O
improviser O

'' O
and O
then O
built O
on O
the O

joining O
with O
Mr. O

in O
some O
Bach B-PERSON
two B-CARDINAL

part O
inventions O
, O
cleverly O
arranged O
for O
clarinet O
and O

by O
Mr. O
Douglas B-PERSON

Keeping O
the O
mood O
light O
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
then O
chanted O
and O
chortled O
their O
way O
through O
some O
murderous O
polyrhythms O
, O
devised O
by O
Mr. O
Douglas B-PERSON
as O
an O
alternative O
to O
Hindemith B-PERSON
's O
dry O
theory O
- O
teaching O
techniques O
, O
and O
then O
, O
with O
Mr. O
Gomez B-PERSON
, O
soared O
and O
improvised O
on O
the O
composer O

tight O
`` O

The O

the O

His O

easy O

Softly O
introducing O
and O
explaining O
his O
pieces O
, O
Mr. O
Glass B-PERSON
looks O
and O
sounds O
more O
like O
a O
shaggy O
poet O
describing O
his O
work O
than O
a O
classical O

playing O
a O

. O

The O
piano O
compositions O
, O
which O
have O
been O
labeled O
variously O
as O
minimalist O
, O
Oriental B-NORP
, O
repetitive O
, O
cyclical O
, O
monophonic O
and O
hypnotic O
, O
are O
relentlessly O
tonal O
-LRB- O
therefore O
unthreatening O
-RRB- O
, O
unvaryingly O
rhythmic O
-LRB- O
therefore O
soporific O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
unflaggingly O
harmonious O
but O
unmelodic O
-LRB- O
therefore O
both O
pretty O
and O
unconventional O
-RRB- O
. O

It O
is O
music O
for O
people O
who O
want O
to O
hear O
something O
different O
but O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
work O
especially O
hard O
at O
the O
task O
. O

It O
is O
E-Z O
listening O
for O
the O
now O
generation O
. O

Mr. O
Glass B-PERSON
has O
inverted O
the O
famous O
modernist O
dictum O
`` O
less O
is O
more O
. O
'' O

His O
more O
is O
always O
less O
. O

Far O
from O
being O
minimalist O
, O
the O
music O
unabatingly O
torments O
us O
with O
apparent O
novelties O
not O
so O
cleverly O
disguised O
in O
the O
simplicities O
of O
4/4 B-CARDINAL
time O
, O
octave O

, O
and O
ragtime O

But O
the O
music O
has O
its O
charm O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Glass B-PERSON
has O
constructed O
his O
solo O
program O
around O
a O
move O

Middle O
age O
and O
the O
changes O
it O
brings O
are O
like O
a O
revolving O
door O
. O

Many O
people O
peacefully O
go O
through O
it O
, O
growing O
wiser O
and O
losing O
their O
rough O
edges O
. O

A O
minority O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
to O
advance O
or O
retreat O
and O
get O
caught O
in O
it O
like O
a O
trap O
. O

Middle O
age O
is O
a O
time O
where O
one O
wears O
more O
hats O
than O
at O
any O
other O
time O
in O
one O
's O
life O
, O
when O
one O
's O
responsibilities O
are O
heaviest O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
crises O
experienced O
by O
a O
minority O
of O
middle O
- O
aged O
people O
can O
involve O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
people O
, O
so O
their O
impact O
can O
not O
be O
overlooked O
. O

Middle O
age O
, O
those B-DATE
years I-DATE
between I-DATE
40 I-DATE
and I-DATE

, O
is O
both O
the O
time O
of O
life O
of O
greatest O
glory O
and O
the O
time O
of O
life O
that O
's O
easiest O
to O
overlook O
. O

In O
comparison O
to O
youth O
or O
old O
age O
, O
the O
middle O
years O
are O
often O
thought O
of O
as O
the O
time O
when O
power O
, O
ability O
, O
wealth O
, O
and O
physical O
strength O
are O
all O
at O
or O
near O
their O
peak O
, O
so O
that O
one O
has O
no O
excuse O
for O
feeling O
melancholy O
. O

Even O
if O
there O
are O
problems O
, O
it O
is O
commonly O
thought O
that O
one O
should O
be O
able O
to O

Social O
bias O
makes O
many O
of O
the O
middle O

afraid O
to O
discuss O
their O
problems O
. O

This O
is O
particularly O
the O
case O
for O
men O
, O
who O
generally O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
talk O
about O
their O
feelings O
. O

But O
by O
keeping O
everything O
inside O
, O
they O
may O
cause O
irreparable O
harm O
to O
their O
health O
. O

In O
recent O
years O
cancer O
, O
sudden O
death O
and O
suicide O
have O
become O
all O
too O
common O
during O
middle O

which O
shows O
that O
the O
psychological O
problems O
of O
the O
middle O
- O
aged O
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
. O

How O
do O
you O
safely O
pass O
through O
the O
changes O
of O
the O
middle O
years O
? O

Here O
are O
a O
few O
suggestions O

, O
looks O
at O
the O
question O
from O
the O
angle O
of O
developmental O
psychology O
. O

He O
points O
out O
that O
the O
path O
of O
life O
is O
continuous O
: O
everyone O
moves O
from O
infancy O
and O
childhood O
, O
to O
youth O
and O
middle O
age O
. O

Smoothly O
passing O
through O
any O
period O
of O
life O
helps O
make O
getting O
through O
the O
next O
period O
easier O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
people O
most O
at O
risk O
during O
middle O
age O
are O
those O
who O
have O
had O
difficulties O
earlier O
in O
life O
. O

Foreign O
research O
shows O
that O
those O
with O
high O
social O
and O
economic O
status O
and O
with O
ample O
financial O
resources O
bear O
up O
better O
during O

and O
have O
more O
ways O
to O
get O
out O
of O

Is O
it O
too O
late O
to O
start O
talking O
about O
these O
problems O
when O
you O
are O

any O

no O
matter O
when O
you O
start O

Middle O
- O
aged O
problems O
are O
rather O
predictable O
, O
and O
they O
're O
not O
hard O
to O
avoid O
. O

Are O
you O
worried O
that O
your O
marriage O
is O
growing O
stale O
? O

Then O
no O
matter O
how O
busy O
you O
are O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
set O
aside O
some O
time O
to O
be O
with O

Are O
you O
worried O
about O

your O

Then O
start O

get O
into O
the O

Are O
you O
worried O
about O
how O
to O
care O
for O
your O
parents O
when O
they O
get O

Then O
spend O
more O

encourage O
them O

get O
more O

take O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things O
to O
be O

about O
during O

that O
you O
had O
better O
get O
an O

Otherwise O

you O

end O

now O

notes O
that O
many O
middle O

who O
have O
worked O
diligently O
for O
years O
to O
attain O
management O
positions O
look O
down O
on O
the O
younger O
generation O
for O
being O
reckless O
and O
disorganized O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
realize O
that O
creativity O
and O
energy O
may O
be O
ready O
to O
explode O
from O
underneath O
these O
flaws O
. O

Stuck O
in O
the O
past O
and O
full O
of O
bitterness O
, O
they O
may O
end O
up O
getting O
discarded O
onto O
the O
scrap O
heap O
of O
history O
. O

With O
each O
new O
era O
, O
role O

change O
. O

Until O
the O
new O

have O
been O
established O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O

, O
today O

have O
come O

the O

They O
set O
high O
expectations O
for O
themselves O
, O
but O
their O
disappointments O
are O
likewise O
large O
. O

Many O
women O
are O
torn O
between O
conflicting O
desires O
: O
to O
be O
good O
homemakers O
like O
their O
mothers O
and O
to O
have O
successful O
careers O
like O
their O
fathers O
. O

Their O
candles O
are O
burning O
at O
both O
ends O
, O
because O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
live O
up O
to O
two B-CARDINAL
old O
role O
models O
rather O
than O
establishing O
a O
new O
one O
for O
themselves O
. O

Then O
there O
are O
men O
who O
insist O
upon O
being O
strict O
fathers O
and O
disciplinarians O
or O
staying O
at O
the O

company O
until O
they O

And O
there O
are O
women O
who O
are O
determined O
to O
play O
the O
role O
of O
the O
traditional O
Chinese B-NORP

Ignoring O

this O

then O
they O

up O

At O

reminds O

to O
think O

about O

about O

Will O

Is O
there O
some O
way O
that O
the O
two O
can O
be O
accomplished O
simultaneously O
? O

When O
facing O

at O

, O
many O

or O
even O
to O
pursue O
their O

in O

Southeast B-LOC

. O

Pursuing O
some O
dream O
of O
really O
making O
it O
big O
, O
many O
men O
use O
up O
their O
savings O
, O
leaving O
their O
wives O
as O
the O
sole O
source O
of O
family O
support O
and O
suffering O

in O
a O
foreign O

. O

There O
's O
no O
right O
or O
wrong O
here O
, O
and O
there O
's O
no O
way O
to O
guarantee O
a O
venture O
will O
be O
successful O
, O
but O
beforehand O
one O
must O
at O
least O
be O
realistic O
and O
prepare O
oneself O
psychologically O
for O
all O
possible O
outcomes O
, O
so O
that O
one O
wo O
n't O
suffer O
losses O
larger O
than O
one O
can O
bear O
. O

" O
It O
is O
indeed O
the O

that O
when O
one O
is O
young O
, O
one O

quiver O
is O
full O
of O
arrows O
and O
opportunities O
abound O
, O
so O
that O
one O
can O
shoot O
at O
will O
, O
" O
says O
Chang B-PERSON
by O
way O
of O
analogy O
. O

" O
Once O
you O
get O
into O
middle O

, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
make O
every O
arrow O
count O
. O
" O

Chang B-PERSON
explains O
that O
everyone O
has O
dreams O
, O
and O
that O
continually O
working O
toward O
those O
dreams O
is O
an O
excellent O
method O
of O
relieving O
stress O
at O
any O
age O
. O

Middle O
- O
aged O
people O
have O
heavy O
burdens O
, O
and O
sometimes O
they O
may O
feel O
as O
if O
they O
are O
suffocating O
under O
them O
. O

" O
But O
accomplishing O
a O
lot O
of O
little O
changes O
can O
bring O
about O
a O
big O
change O
. O
" O

If O
you O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
do O
what O
you O
can O
, O
you O
will O
immediately O
find O
that O
your O
burdens O
have O
been O
lightened O
. O

Chang B-PERSON
cites O
this O
example O
: O
Say O
you O
hate O
being O
tied O
up O
by O
your O
work O
, O
and O
would O
like O
to O
go O
back O
to O
school O
. O

Why O
do O
n't O
you O
try O
a O
weekend O
class O
? O

Maybe O
that O
would O
help O
to O
alleviate O
your O
anxiety O
. O

Or O
if O
you O
are O
a O
housewife O
, O
taking O
care O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
generations O
and O
resentful O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
go O
out O
and O
get O
the O
sense O
of O
accomplishment O
that O
comes O
with O
a O
full O
- O
time O
job O
, O
then O
maybe O
you O
could O
work O
as O
a O
volunteer O
in O
a O
community O
organization O
. O

This O
would O
both O
put O
you O
into O
contact O
with O
other O
people O
and O
help O
you O
gain O
a O
sense O
of O
accomplishment O
. O

And O
you O
can O
help O
to O
sweat O
off O
your O
middle O

aged O
anxieties O
by O
making O
a O
habit O
of O
regularly O
exercising O
. O

What O
's O
more O
, O
do O
n't O
worry O
too O
much O
about O
time O
being O
short O
. O

Remember O
that O
most O
modern O
people O
live O
long O
lives O
that O
can O
be O
divided O
up O
into O
many O
stages O
. O

In O
middle O
age O
, O
when O
you O
discover O
that O
your O
personal O
desires O
are O
coming O
into O
conflict O
with O
the O
demands O
of O
your O
family O
or O
society O
, O
decide O
which O
of O
your O
problems O
are O
the O
most O
urgent O
. O

Do O
n't O
try O
to O
accomplish O
all O
of O
your O
dreams O
at O
once O
. O

Maintain O
an O
unhurried O
frame O

peacefully O
wait O
for O

I O
'm O
flying O
in O

. O

By O
ya- O

Like O

South B-GPE
Carolina I-GPE

's O
getting O
I O
me- O
he O
's O
got O
off O
from O
the O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
eighth I-DATE

and O
right O
now O
I O
've O
got O
a O
flight O
that O
I O
'm O
coming O
in O
like O
ten B-CARDINAL
or O
eleven B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning I-TIME
something O
like O
that O
. O

okay O
. O

And O
then O

And O
when O
are O
you O
all O
coming O
to O
South B-GPE
Carolina I-GPE
? O

I- O

What O
? O

When O
are O
you O
going O
to O
South B-GPE
Carolina I-GPE
? O

I O
'm O
not O
sur- O
I O
mean O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
he O
's O
planning O
on O
doing O
it O

wait O

the O
l- O
the O
luncheon O
or O
dinner O
thing O
is O
on O
the O
second B-DATE
, O
right O
? O

%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Let O
me O

I O
think O
your O
mom O
said O
their O
was O
something O
planned O
the O
day O
before O
for O
the O
family O
. O

yeah O
, O

%um O
I O
have O
to O
find O
that O
calendar O
here O
%um O
. O

yeah O
, O

it O
might O
be O
like O
there O
's O
some O
dinner O
the O
night O
before O

that O
could O
be O
. O

I O
think O
so O
. O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
we O
'll O
drive O
down O
the O
thirty B-DATE
- I-DATE
first I-DATE
or O
the O
first B-DATE
or O
if O
whether O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
exactly O
whether O
he O
's O
going O
to O
do O
it O
in O
you O
know O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
or O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

oh O

yeah O
. O

%um O
you O
know O
what O
? O

%um O
Cynthia B-PERSON
's O
coming O
and O
David B-PERSON
and O
their O
kids O

oh O
great O
. O

And O
they O
were O
going O
to O
bring O
Ralph B-PERSON

but O
I O
guess O
he O
's O
they O
're O
not O
sure O
now O
because O
they O
just O
found O
some O
kind O
of O
cancer O
in O
his O
brain O
oh O
no O
they O
Or O
some O
a O
spot O
in O
his O
brain O
li- O

you O
know O
he O
had O
lung O
cancer O

is O
that O

I O
know O

and O
they O
were O
so O
optimistic O
. O

So O
th- O
anyway O
they O
just O
found O
something O

and O
they O
're O
going O
to O
start O
treating O
it O
like O
this O
week O

so O
now O
they O
're O
not O
sure O
if O
he O
can O
come O

but O
mom O
thought O
it O
was O
so O
sweet O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
come O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
are O
they O
going O
to O
still O
come O
? O

I O
think O
so O
. O

I O
mean O

Who O
else O
but O
cousins O
are O
coming O
, O

do O
you O
know O
? O

%um O
, O
Abby B-PERSON
's O
coming O

With O
the O
baby O
and O
Michal B-PERSON

uh-huh O
? O

And O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
're O
they O
're O
livin- O
they O
're O
going O
to O
be O
moving O
to O
Detroit B-PERSON
. O

yeah O
, O

I O

be O
living O
clo- O
not O

from O
Johnny B-PERSON
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O
and O
then O
%um O
pe- O
let O
's O
see O
Pevie B-PERSON
's O
coming O

mhm O
. O

And O
like O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
if O
the O
whole O
family O
is O

just O
him O

mhm O
. O

%um O
, O
and O
mom O
's O
not O

about O
Ethan B-PERSON

area O
. O

l- O

and O
Marilyn B-PERSON

I O
I O
do O
n't O

her O
. O

uh-huh O

I O
ha- O

I O

basically O

what O

is O
you O
know O
come O
and O
we O
'll O
talk O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

basically O
the O
one O

okay O

the O
well O
Interns B-ORG
For I-ORG
Peace I-ORG
retracted O
their O
offer O
because O
they O
decided O
I O
was O
n't O
enthusiastic O
enough O
. O

Who O
's O
this O
? O

%um O
Interns B-ORG
For I-ORG
Peace I-ORG
? O

mhm O
. O

Like O
they O
had O
offered O
me O
a O
place O

and O
then O
they O
took O
it O
back O
. O

But O
did O
n't O
you O
also O
say O
you O
you O
were O
still O
were O
n't O
that O
keen O
on O
them O
? O

Right O
, O

I O
was O
n't O

but O
I O
still O
would O
have O
rather O
rejected O
them O
than O
have O
them O
reject O
me O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

And O
then O
%um O
and O
then O
the O
next O
place O
which O
I O
was O
so O
hopeful O
about O
was O
was O
%um O
Moden B-ORG
Nisan I-ORG

yeah O

yeah O

That O
thing O
at O
Haifa B-GPE
with O
%eh O
the B-ORG
Young I-ORG
Women I-ORG
's I-ORG
Leadership I-ORG
Program I-ORG
. O

yeah O
? O

And O
the O
woman O
made O
it O
sound O
so O
promising O

and O
I O
waited O
two B-DATE
months I-DATE
to O
hear O
back O

mhm O
. O

And O
then O
I O
had O
n't O
heard O
from O
her O

and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
date O

so O
I O
called O

mhm O
. O

And O
she O
said O
oh O
I O
was O
going O
to O
fax O
you O
this O
evening O

%um O
you O
know O
we O
're O
not O
really O
sure O
what O
's O
happening O
. O

The O
position O
may O
be O
being O
redefined O

%eh O
. O

And O
then O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
, O
she O
called O
me O
and O
left O
a O
message O
saying O
oh O
you O
know O
they O
had O
all O
these O
things O
on O
the O
burner O

and O
r- O
I O
should O
really O
look O
someplace O
else O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
's O
going O
on O

and O

%hm O
. O

And O
so O
th- O
I O
had O
really O
stopped O
looking O
for O
things O
because O
he O
made O
it O
sound O
so O
promising O
and O
like O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
almost O
fulltime O
. O

%hm O
. O

And O
then O
That O
's O
a O
shame O
. O
And O
then O
it O
you O
know O
so O
instead O
it O
and O
now O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
maybe O
a O
ten O
hour O
a O
week O
position O

and O
it O
requires O
fluent O
Hebrew B-LANGUAGE

and O
it O
's O
just O
totally O
different O
than O
what O
we O
had O
talked O
about O
. O

That O
's O
a O
shame O

And O
so O
then O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
Giva B-ORG
- I-ORG
Haviva I-ORG
had O
offered O
me O
a O
a O
very O
short O

be O
nice O
to O
be O
on O
the O
kibbutz O
because O
then O
I O
would O
get O
to O
know O
some O
people O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

But O
anyway O
, O

so O
then O
%ah O

but O
that O
was O
three B-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
that O
they O
offered O
me O
that O

and O
you O
know O
who O
knows O
if O
they O
found O
someone O

so O
I O
faxed O
them O
about O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

yeah O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
I O
had O
n't O
heard O
back O
from O
them O

and O
so O
I O
I O
called O
the O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
office O

and O
she O
said O
she O
'd O
get O
back O
to O
me O
probably O
you O
know O
yesterday B-DATE
or O
today B-DATE
, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
could O
talk O
with O
them O
. O

%hm O
. O

mhm O
. O

Because O
maybe O
they O
found O
someone O
, O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
that O
's O

I O
'm O
I O
'm O
really O
hoping O
that O
that O
would O
work O
out O
you O
know O
, O

it O
's O
just O
something O

yeah O
. O

But O
if O
not O
I O
mean O
I O
'm O
just O
coming O
anyway O

but O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
like O
where O
I O
'll O
go O

When O
are O
you O
planning O
on O
coming O
? O

And O

Sometime O
either O
like O
mid B-DATE
to I-DATE
late I-DATE
September I-DATE
or O
early B-DATE
October I-DATE
. O

mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O

%um O

Because O
I O
'm O
thinking O
that O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
stop O
in O

From O

the O
number O

The O
controversy O
kicked O
up O
by O
the O
proliferation O
of O
these O
all O
- O
terrain O
bicycles O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
divisive O
storms O
to O
blow O
through O
the O
national O
conservation O
movement O
in O
recent O
memory O
. O

Bikers O
-- O
many O
of O
them O
ardent O
environmentalists O
-- O
proclaim O
their O
sport O
an O
efficient O
, O
safe O
, O
fitness O
- O
promoting O
way O
to O
get O
back O
to O
nature O
, O
while O
asserting O
a O
right O
, O
as O
taxpayers O
, O
to O
pedal O
on O
public O
lands O
. O

But O
the O
bikes O
' O
burgeoning O
numbers O
, O
safety O
concerns O
and O
fear O
that O
they O
damage O
fragile O
landscapes O
have O
prompted O
pleas O
, O
from O
the O
Sierras B-LOC
to O
the B-LOC
Eastern I-LOC
Seaboard I-LOC
, O
to O
ban O
them O
from O
the O
back O
country O
. O

Key O
to O
the O
issue O
is O
that O
the O
bikes O
, O
in O
skillful O
hands O
, O
can O
go O
virtually O
anywhere O
, O
and O
in O
reckless O
hands O
can O
become O
vehicles O
of O
terror O
. O

An O
adept O
bicyclist O
can O
leap O
from O
a O
dead O
stop O
to O
the O
top O
of O
a O
picnic O
table O
without O
losing O
balance O
. O

Such O
skills O
allow O
riders O
to O
fly O
down O
treacherous O
mountain O
grades O
at O
speeds O
of O
up B-QUANTITY
to I-QUANTITY
40 I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
an I-QUANTITY
hour I-QUANTITY
-- O
a O
thrill O
for O
the O
cyclist O
but O
a O
nightmare O
for O
unsuspecting O
hikers O
or O
equestrians O
. O

For O
harried O
public O
- O
land O
managers O
across O
the O
nation O
, O
the O
response O
is O
increasingly O
to O
shut O
the O
gates O
. O

The O
state O
of O
California B-GPE
, O
following O
the O
lead O
of O
some O
regional O
parks O
, O
recently O
adopted O
regulations O
that O
closed O
nearly O
all O
hiking O
paths O
in O
state O
parks O
to O
mountain O
bicycles O
. O

The O
move O
largely O
consigns O
them O
to O
roads O
used O
by O
motorized O
vehicles O
. O

Most O
other O
states O
have O
enacted O
similar O
bans O
. O

The O
bikes O
are O
unwelcome O
on O
trails O
in O
national O
parks O
. O

Even O
the O
U.S. B-ORG
Forest I-ORG
Service I-ORG
, O
whose O
lenient O
`` O
multiple O
- O
use O
'' O
philosophy O
permits O
motorized O
vehicles O
on O
thousands B-QUANTITY
of I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
of O
its O
trails O
across O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
, O
has O
begun O
to O
close O
some O
lands O
to O
the O
bikes O
, O
including O
major O
portions O
of O
the O
popular O
Pacific B-FAC
Crest I-FAC
Trail I-FAC
, O
which O
stretches O
from O
California B-GPE
to O
Canada B-GPE
. O

Often O
these O
closings O
come O
after O
vigorous O
anti-bike O
lobbying O
by O
conservation O
organizations O
, O
the O
politically O
potent O
Sierra B-ORG
Club I-ORG
among O
them O
. O

Sierra B-ORG
has O
been O
instrumental O
in O
securing O
a O
number O
of O
the O
California B-GPE
bans O
. O

It O
has O
been O
waging O
an O
all O
- O
out O
campaign O
to O
beat O
back O
a O
proposal O
, O
pushed O
by O
Utah B-GPE
bike O
groups O
, O
to O
allow O
the O
cycles O
in O
federally O
designated O
wilderness O
areas O
, O
where O
they O
are O
now O
prohibited O
. O

Yet O
Sierra B-ORG
's O
hard O
- O
line O
stance O
has O
created O
something O
of O
a O
rift O
in O
the O
organization O
, O
which O
estimates O
that O
17 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
its O
500,000 B-CARDINAL
members O
own O
mountain O
bikes O
. O

Pressure O
from O
these O
members O
prompted O
the O
club O
recently O
to O
soften O
its O
anti-bike O
rhetoric O
; O
it O
no O
longer O
, O
for O
example O
, O
lumps O
the O
bikes O
into O
the O
same O
category O
as O
motorcycles O
and O
other O
terrain O
- O
marring O
off O
- O
road O
vehicles O
. O

But O
the O
club O
still O
insists O
that O
public O
lands O
ought O
to O
be O
closed O
to O
the O
bikes O
unless O
studies O
indicate O
the O
bikes O
wo O
n't O
injure O
the O
environment O

other O
users O

hit O
by O
a O

in O
the O
summer O
of O
1974 B-DATE

The O
farmer O
Yang B-PERSON
Zhifa I-PERSON
and O
a O

were O
digging O
a O
well O
when O
a O

clinked O
on O
something O
hard O
. O

Yang B-PERSON
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Whoa O
! O
It O
's O
them O
! O
" O

Locals O
had O
talked O
for O
generations O
about O
the O
buried O
clay O

that O
they O
would O
sometimes O
run O
across O
while O
digging O
in O
the O
fields O

Everyone O
knew O
they O
were O
out O
there O
, O
but O
no O
one O
knew O
quite O
what O
they O
were O
. O

People O
figured O
they O
must O
have O
been O
connected O
with O
ancestral O
spirits O
of O
some O
sort O
. O

Anxious O
not O
to O
run O
afoul O
of O
the O
netherworld O

the O
farmers O
would O
always O
hurriedly O
throw O
dirt O
back O

the O
spot O

find O
a O
better O
place O

This O

Yang B-PERSON

went O
a O
step O
further O

He O
reported O
the O
incident O
to O
his O
superiors O
at O
the O
local O

It O
was O

long O
before O

" O
or O
Qin B-PERSON
Shi I-PERSON
Huang I-PERSON
. O

A O
believer O
in O
the O
possibility O
of O
immortality O
, O
the O
emperor O
once O
dispatched O
a O
trusted O
aide O
on O
a O
voyage O
across O
the O
seas O
to O
search O
for O
magic O
herbs O
that O
would O
provide O
eternal O
youth O
. O

Perhaps O
as O
" O
plan O
B O
, O
" O
he O
also O
poured O
vast O
resources O
into O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
burial O
mound O
equipped O
with O
all O
the O
accoutrements O
that O
he O
was O
accustomed O
to O
in O
the O
here O
and O
now O
. O

The O
population O
of O
the O
kingdom O
of O
Qin B-PERSON
at O
that O
time O
was O
about B-CARDINAL
20 I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
, O
of O
whom O
over O
2 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
were O
mobilized O
to O
bring O
his O
grand O
underground O
palace O
to O
completion O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
complex O
has O
been O
discovered O
, O
it O
is O
unquestionably O
the O
life O
- O
size O
terracotta O
warriors O
and O
horses O
that O
inspire O
the O
most O
amazement O
. O

The O
8,000 B-CARDINAL
figures O
that O
have O
been O
unearthed O
at O
the O
site O
in O
Shaanxi B-GPE
Province I-GPE
were O
all O
executed O
with O
painstaking O
realism O
. O

The O
rank O
of O
each O
figure O
determined O
every O
little O
detail O
of O
its O
making O
, O
right O
down O
to O
the O
type O
of O
military O
uniform O
, O
cap O
, O
armor O
, O
hairstyle O
, O
and O
beard O
. O

Artisans O
even O
incised O
the O
soles O
of O
the O
soldiers O
' O
shoes O
to O
show O
the O
threads O
, O
and O
made O
sure O
the O
horses O
' O
teeth O
were O
realistically O
done O
. O

Each O
face O
is O
unique O
. O

Some O
characters O
project O
an O
air O
of O
stern O
authority O
. O

Others O
suggest O
a O
fierce O
and O
violent O
personality O
. O

Still O
other O
faces O
clearly O
belong O
to O
tender O
, O
untested O
young O
greenhorns O
. O

The O
tremendous O
individuality O
in O
the O
warriors O
never O
fails O
to O
amaze O
. O

Indeed O
, O
there O
are O
people O
who O
subscribe O
to O
the O
rumor O
that O
each O
clay O
figure O
encloses O
the O
corpse O
of O
a O
real O
person O
. O

Careful O
inspection O
of O
the O
markings O
on O
the O
figures O
reveals O
that O
about O
90 B-CARDINAL
" O
master O
craftsmen O
" O
participated O
in O
the O
making O
of O
the O
terracotta O
warriors O
, O
each O
supported O
by O
a O
team O
of O
ten O
or O
more O
assistants O
. O

The O
total O
number O
of O
artisans O
involved O
probably O
came O
to O
nearly O
a O
thousand B-CARDINAL
. O

Some O
of O
them O
were O
employed O
by O
imperial O
kilns O
, O
while O
others O
came O
from O
private O
establishments O
. O

It O
was O
a O
huge O
undertaking O
, O
for O
each O
figure O
had O
to O
be O
shaped O
, O
molded O
, O
kneaded O
, O
sculpted O
, O
and O
painted O
. O

Decorative O
relief O
elements O
had O
to O
be O
applied O
. O

The O
figures O
had O
to O
be O
covered O
with O
an O
off O
- O
white O
slip O
to O
approximate O
the O
color O
of O
skin O
. O

The O
hair O
, O
too O
, O
had O
to O
be O
appropriately O
colored O
. O

Even O
the O
horses O
were O
painted O
in O
appropriate O
shades O
of O
reddish O
- O
brown O
and O
black O
. O

Their O
tongues O
were O
done O
in O
pink O
, O
and O
their O
teeth O
in O
white O
. O

The O
soldiers O
stand O
a O
surprising O
180 B-QUANTITY
centimeters I-QUANTITY
in O
height O
, O
prompting O
many O
to O
ask O
whether O
the O
men O
of O
that O
time O
were O
actually O
taller O
than O
their O
modern O
counterparts O
. O

There O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
theories O
concerning O
this O
question O
, O
says O
Wu B-PERSON
Yongqi I-PERSON
, O
the O
head O
of O
the B-ORG
Museum I-ORG
of I-ORG
Terracotta I-ORG
Warriors I-ORG
. O

In O
Taipei B-GPE
for O
the O
exhibit O
, O
Wu B-PERSON
explains O
that O
some O
say O
it O
is O
natural O
that O
the O
figures O
should O
be O
taller O
since O
people O
from O
China B-GPE
's O
northwest O
- O
where O
the O
Qin B-PERSON
kingdom O
was O
located O
- O
have O
always O
been O
taller O
than O
other O
Chinese B-NORP
. O

Others O
, O
however O
, O
theorize O
that O
the O
artisans O
intentionally O
made O
the O
figures O
slightly O
larger O
than O
life O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
shrinkage O
that O
would O
take O
place O
while O
the O
freshly O
molded O
figures O
were O
drying O
. O

The O
cultured O
side O
of O
Qin B-PERSON

But O
if O
you O
visit O
the O
exhibit O
, O
do O
n't O
be O
so O
dazzled O
by O
the O
terracotta O
figures O
that O
you O
forget O
all O
about O
the O
exhibit O

, O

, O
stated O
after O
visiting O
the O
exhibit O
that O
most O
of O
our O
knowledge O
concerning O
the O
Qin B-PERSON
dynasty O
comes O
from O
official O
dynastic O
histories O
authored O
during O
the O
Han B-NORP
period O
. O

These O
later O
authors O
generally O
had O
a O
jaundiced O
view O
of O
the O
Qin B-PERSON
, O
and O
tended O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
ruthless O
, O
autocratic O
rule O
of O
Qin B-PERSON
Shi I-PERSON
Huang I-PERSON
while O
paying O
less O
attention O
to O
the O
positive O
achievements O
of O
Qin B-PERSON
culture O
, O
or O
the O
beauty O
of O
Qin B-PERSON
handicrafts O

its O

An O

was O
overheard O
exclaiming O
to O
his O
wife O
: O
" O
They O
made O
such O
beautiful O

I O
wonder O
if O
we O

Each O
chariot O
is O
assembled O
from O
over O
7,000 B-CARDINAL
different O
pieces O
, O
and O
is O
half B-CARDINAL
the O

which O
has O
been O
described O
as O
" O
the O

" O
on O
account O
of O
its O
huge O

and O

In O
addition O
, O
scholars O
have O
discovered O
that O
the O
bronze O
weapons O
unearthed O
along O
with O
the O
soldiers O
all O
have O
a O

Arrowheads O

a O

And O
a O

It O
is O
evident O
that O
the O
bronze O

the O

dismiss O
an O

claiming O
among O

Mrs. O

, O
were O

embezzling O
more B-MONEY

$ I-MONEY
100 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
from O
that O
country O
and O
then O
fraudulently O
concealing O
much O
of O
the O

through O

of O
prime O

in O
Manhattan B-GPE
. O

Mrs. O

asked O

to O
give O
them O
access O

The O
U.S. B-GPE
attorney O

office O
, O
in O

it O
filed O
in O
response O
, O
said O
Mrs. O
Marcos B-PERSON
was O
making O
the O
`` O
fanciful O
-- O
and O
factually O
unsupported O
-- O
claim O
that O
she O
was O
kidnapped O

'' O
in O

to O
obtain O

in O
the O

The O

also O
said O
Mrs. O
Marcos B-PERSON

her O

were O
n't O
brought O

the O
U.S. B-GPE
against O
their O

after O
Mr. O

The O

quoted O

from O
the O

they O
said O
they O
were O

this O

at O
the O

of O
President O

that O
they O
were O
enjoying O
the O
hospitality O
of O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
. O

Lawyers O
for O
Mrs. O

say O
that O
because O
she O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
against O
her O
wishes O
, O
the O
federal O
court O
lacks O

THE O

A O
federal O

in O
Manhattan B-GPE
threw O

the O

The O

however O
, O
said O
the O

did O

adequately O
consider O
whether O

Mr. O

the O
martyred O

time O

Does O
Lebanon B-GPE
not O

the O
right O

set O
an O
example O

punishing O
the O

its O
youth O
? O

All O
those O
who O
resist O
the O
establishment O
of O

international O

must O
see O
today O
that O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
assassination O
of O
Pierre B-PERSON
Gemayel I-PERSON
was O
to O
instigate O
a O
coup O
against O
those O
who O
want O

liberate O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
reinstate O
its O
sovereignty O
. O

And O
preventing O
the O
adoption O

the O
international O

a O
response O

the O

those O
murderers O

What O
is O

that O

target O

A O

on O
the O
3rd B-ORDINAL
, O
killing O

people O
. O

The O
initial O
assessment O
by O
the O
police O
is O
that O
the O
accident O
was O
caused O
by O
a O

Inspectors O

went O
to O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
accident O
on O
the O
4th B-ORDINAL
to O
investigate O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
accident O
. O

Based O
on O
a O
preliminary O
assessment O
of O
the O
skid O
marks O
reaching O
forty B-QUANTITY
meters I-QUANTITY
in O
length O
that O
were O
left O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
the O
accident O
was O
probably O
the O
result O
of O
a O
brake O
malfunction O
and O
a O
burst O
rear O
right O
tire O
that O
caused O
a O
loss O
of O
control O
over O
the O
vehicle O
body O

Another O
investigator O
said O
that O
excessive O

a O
loss O
of O
control O
as O
the O
vehicle O
involved O
in O
the O
accident O
descended O
the O
slope O
could O
also O
possibly O
have O
been O
a O
factor O
. O

The O
inspectors O
also O
discovered O
during O
the O
investigation O
that O
the O
driver O
was O
possibly O
driving O
without O
a O
license O
. O

Taiwanese B-NORP
media O
reported O
that O
, O
according O
to O
regulations O
, O
the O

But O
because O
the O

it O
is O
very O

that O
the O

There O
can O

no O
quibbling O
that O
the O

but O
one O
has O
to O
wonder O
what O
possible O
good O
such O
a O
resolution O

It O
puts O
great O
strain O
on O
a O
longstanding O
U.S. B-GPE
friendship O
with O
Turkey B-GPE

a O
country O
that O
has O
been O
one O
of O
America B-GPE

strongest O
allies O
in O
NATO B-ORG

The O
resolution O
also O
comes O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Turkey B-GPE
has O
been O
seeking O
help O
from O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
in O
resolving O
its O
Bulgarian B-NORP

controversy O

pursuing O

Turkey B-GPE
has O
been O
fighting O
its O
past O
for O
years B-DATE
, O
and O
thus O
far O
has O
been O
only O
partially O
successful O

Must O
it O
now O
accept O
that O
one O
of O
its O
strongest O
allies O
blames O
it O
for O
the O
genocide O
of O
another O
people O
? O

Such O
sentiment O
only O
encourages O
the O
adverse O
feelings O
toward O
Turkey B-GPE
that O
surfaced O
when O
Turkey B-GPE
asked O
for O
assistance O

Mr. O
Dole B-PERSON
's O
odd O
effort O
notwithstanding O
, O
most O
of O
Turkey B-GPE

political O
problems O
lie O
with O
the O
Europeans B-NORP

Part O
of O
the O
problem O
some O
Europeans B-NORP
have O
with O
Turkey B-GPE
seems O
to O
stem O
from O
its O
location O
-- O
Turkey B-GPE
is O

really O
part O

Europe B-LOC

Why O
, O
they O
wonder O
, O
should O
it O
belong O
to O
the O
EC B-ORG
? O

Another O
anti-Turkish B-NORP
hook O
is O
the O
Islamic B-NORP
faith O
of O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
Turkish B-NORP
people O
: O
Turkey B-GPE
, O
we O
are O
told O
, O

not O
a O
Christian B-NORP
nation O
; O
its O

wo O

fit O
in O
with O
the O
Western B-NORP
European I-NORP
Judeo B-NORP
- I-NORP
Christian I-NORP
tradition O
. O

It O
's O
when O
these O
rationalizations O
fall O
on O
deaf O
ears O
that O
the O
old O
standby O
of O
retribution O
for O
treatment O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
the B-GPE
Ottoman I-GPE
Empire I-GPE
comes O
to O
the O
fore O
. O

No O
one O
has O
to O
accept O
the O
sins O
of O
the B-GPE
Ottoman I-GPE
Empire I-GPE
to O
reject O
that O
argument O

Now O
it O

The O

Last B-DATE

, O
a O

a O

During O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
15 I-DATE

, O
the O
report O

nearly O
fivefold O

who O
it O

up O
ninefold O

The O

The O

that O
those O

will O
not O
necessarily O
lead O
to O
a O
resolution O

current O

it O
will O
deprive O
fundamentalist O

its O

this O

be O
a O

tomorrow O

A O

British B-NORP
document O
revealed O
that O
Britain B-GPE
had O
considered O

that O
would O

The O
document O
, O

yesterday O
as O

British B-NORP
Intelligence O
documents O
that O
were O
declassified O
after O
the O
passage O

, O
stated O
that O
the O
commanders O
of O
the O
British B-NORP
army O
who O
prepared O
the O
plan O
believed O
the O
course O
of O
the O

could O
be O
changed O
to O
cut O
off O
90 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O

the O
Egyptian B-NORP

This O
would O
damage O
vast O

Egypt B-GPE
, O
as O

, O
and O
would O
thereby O
destroy O
the O
Egyptian B-NORP
economy O

weaken O
Abdel B-PERSON

According O
to O
this O
plan O
, O
it O
was O

that O

The O

The O
document O
stated O
that O
the O

of O
the O

was O
later O
abandoned O
because O
Britain B-GPE
feared O
it O
might O
backfire O
violently O
on O
the O
Egyptian B-NORP
side O
. O

Also O
, O
those O
who O
prepared O
the O

realized O
that O
the O
project O
might O
take O
months B-DATE

The O
document O
also O
revealed O
that O
John B-PERSON

the O

observed O

. O

But O
its O
fangs O
are O
especially O
long O
, O
and O
it O
secretes O
the O
largest O
quantity O
of O
venom O
of O
any O
Taiwanese B-NORP
snake O
. O

However O
, O
the O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
lives O
in O
the O
dark O
depths O
of O
the O
dense O
jungle O
, O
and O
its O
numbers O
are O
relatively O
small O
. O

Not O
only O
does O
it O
take O
a O
goodly O
portion O
of O
luck O
for O
a O
snake O
hunter O
to O
find O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
- O
the O
number O
of O
people O
unfortunate O
enough O
to O
be O
bitten O
by O
one O
is O
also O
very O
small O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
mountain O
lover O
who O
often O
encounters O
snakes O
on O
his O
hiking O
expeditions O
describes O
the O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
as O
" O
cool O
, O
calm O
and O
collected O
, O
" O
and O
people O
who O
have O
kept O
or O
observed O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacers O
also O
say O
they O
" O
do O
n't O
lash O
out O
blindly O
. O
" O

Hu B-PERSON
Tai I-PERSON

li I-PERSON
describes O
them O
as O
" O
really O
the O
chieftain O
among O
snakes O
- O
they O
have O
a O
serene O
, O
tolerant O
nature O
, O
and O
are O
not O
apt O
to O
attack O
people O
wantonly O
. O
" O

Perhaps O
it O
is O
because O
of O
this O
regal O
temperament O
that O
they O
are O
revered O
as O
ancestral O
spirits O
by O
the O
Paiwan B-NORP
. O

The O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
belongs O
to O
the O
viper O
family O
, O
which O
was O
the O
last O
of O
the O
snake O
families O
to O
evolve O
. O

Unlike O
the O
more O
primitive O
pythons O
and O
blind O
snakes O
, O
the O

all O
have O
venom O

explains O
that O
snakes O
evolved O
from O
hole O
- O
dwelling O
animals O
, O
and O
lacking O
limbs O
, O
they O
are O
less O
agile O
than O
most O
quadrupeds O
. O

Their O
vision O
and O
hearing O
are O
also O
poor O
. O

Hence O
their O
poison O
fangs O
are O
almost O
the O
only O
tools O
they O
have O
to O
catch O
food O
and O
defend O
themselves O
with O
. O

In O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
Tu B-PERSON
and O
his O
research O

have O
gradually O
researched O
the O
ecology O
of O
the O
viper O
species O
Trimeresurus O
gracilis O
, O
which O
is O
endemic O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
and O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
green O
tree O
viper O
. O

But O
few O
researchers O
have O
taken O
an O
interest O
in O
the O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
, O
which O
lives O
deep O
in O
the O

and O
has O
limited O
distribution O
. O

Although O
it O
is O
an O

says O
that O
as O
far O
as O
is O
known O
from O
observation O
of O
snakes O
in O
the O
wild O
, O
they O
live O
largely O
solitary O
lives O
. O

Their O
sense O

is O
an O
important O

of O

, O
and O
in O
the O

male O

are O
attracted O
by O

released O
by O

. O

In O
late B-DATE
October I-DATE
1999 I-DATE
, O
the O
zoo O
began O
putting O
the O
male O
and O
female O
hundred B-CARDINAL

pacers O
together O
in O
pairs O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
pair O
took O
a O
liking O
to O
each O
other O
. O

The O
male O
gently O
courted O
the O
female O
by O
licking O
her O
head O
with O
his O
tongue O
. O

For O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
the O

were O
inseparable O
, O
after O
which O
they O
gradually O
returned O
to O
their O
solitary O

. O

In O
February B-DATE
of I-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
the O
female O
snake O

belly O
gradually O
began O
to O
swell O
, O
and O
an O
ultrasound O

confirmed O
she O
was O
pregnant O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
after O
she O
laid O
her O
eggs O
, O
the O
female O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacer O
protected O
them O
vigorously O
. O

Not O
daring O
to O
anger O
her O
, O
the O
zoo O
staff O
waited O
for O
her O
maternal O
instincts O
to O
subside O
somewhat O
before O
removing O
the O
eggs O
. O

In O
August B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
as O
Taiwan B-GPE
was O
being O
buffeted O
by O
a O
typhoon O
, O
over O
20 B-CARDINAL
eggs O
hatched O
out O
into O
tiny O
snakes O
, O
which O
the O
zoo O
hopes O
can O
grow O
up O
safe O
and O
sound O
. O

During O
this O
first B-ORDINAL
breeding O
session O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
anything O
going O
wrong O
with O
the O
pregnancy O
the O
zoo O

disturbed O
the O

But O
Lin B-PERSON

says O
that O
next O

around O
they O
will O
gather O

However O
, O
no O

how O
many O

we O
can O
see O
at O
the O

it O

that O

that O

to O
imitate O
the O

of O
the O

, O
all O
the O

said O
they O
had O
never O
heard O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL

make O
a O

. O

Lavuras B-PERSON
asked O
the O
scholars O
bluntly O
where O
they O
had O
seen O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacers O
. O

If O
it O
was O
in O
the O
zoo O
, O
the O
snakes O
were O
away O
from O
their O
natural O
environment O
. O

But O
even O
if O
it O
was O
in O
the O
wild O
, O
with O
the O
great O
environmental O
changes O
of O
modern O
times O
the O
snakes O
might O
have O
been O
" O
struck O
dumb O
" O
too O
! O

Whether O
hundred B-CARDINAL
- O
pacers O
really O
do O
have O
a O
voice O
is O
an O
unanswered O
question O
of O
biology O
. O

But O
perhaps O
the O
aborigines O
' O
open O
attitude O
toward O
and O
involvement O
in O
the O
natural O
world O
, O
as O
revealed O
in O
their O
legend O
of O
the O
nose O

, O
is O
something O
even O
harder O
to O
imagine O
for O
modern O
people O
who O
received O
a O
rationalist O
education O
and O
operate O
in O
a O

Perhaps O
in O
this B-EVENT

, O

unleash O

Scientists O

the O

in O

is O
painting O
a O
new O
and O
startling O
picture O
of O
how O

An O

the O

is O
expected O
to O
produce O
an O
array O
of O
new O
strategies O
for O
future O

. O

That O
is O
for O
the O
future O
. O

Already O
, O
scientists O
are O
developing O
tests O
based O
on O
the O
newly O
identified O

that O
, O
for O
the O

can O

`` O
It O

'' O
says O
Bert B-PERSON
Vogelstein I-PERSON
, O
a O
Johns B-ORG

University I-ORG
researcher O
who O
has O
just O
found O
a O
gene O
pivotal O
to O
the O

. O

`` O
Only B-DATE
a I-DATE

cancer O
was O
a O
black O
box O

which O
we O

nothing O
at O

level O
. O

Today B-DATE
, O
we O
know O
that O
the O
accumulation O
of O
several O
of O
these O
altered O
genes O
can O
initiate O
a O
cancer O
and O
, O
then O
, O
propel O
it O
into O
a O
deadly O
state O
. O
'' O

Scientists O
call O
the O
new O
class O
of O
genes O
tumor O
- O
suppressors O
, O
or O
simply O
anti-cancer O
genes O
. O

When O
functioning O
normally O
, O
they O
make O
proteins O
that O
hold O
a O
cell O

growth O
in O
check O

But O
if O
the O
genes O
are O
damaged O
-- O
perhaps O
by O
radiation O

a O
chemical O
or O
through O
a O
chance O
accident O
in O
cell O

-- O
their O
growth O
- O
suppressing O
proteins O
no O
longer O
work O
, O
and O
cells O
normally O
under O
control O
turn O
malignant O
. O

The O
newly O
identified O
genes O
differ O
from O
a O
family O
of O
genes O
discovered O
in O
the B-DATE
early I-DATE
1980s I-DATE
called O
oncogenes O
. O

Oncogenes O
must O
be O
present O
for O
a O
cell O
to O
become O
malignant O
, O
but O
researchers O
have O
found O
them O
in O
normal O
as O
well O
as O
in O
cancerous O
cells O
, O
suggesting O
that O
oncogenes O
do O
n't O
cause O
cancer O
by O
themselves O
. O

In O
recent B-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
researchers O
have O
come O
to O
believe O
the O
two O
types O
of O
cancer O
genes O
work O
in O
concert O
: O
An O
oncogene O
may O
turn O
proliferating O
cells O
malignant O
only O
after O
the O
tumor O
- O
suppressor O
gene O
has O
been O
damaged O
. O

Like O
all O
genes O
, O
tumor O
- O
suppressor O
genes O
are O
inherited O
in O
two B-CARDINAL
copies O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
from O
each O
parent O
. O

Either O
copy O
can O
make O
the O
proteins O
needed O
to O
control O
cell O
growth O
, O
so O
for O
cancer O
to O
arise O
, O
both O
copies O
must O
be O
impaired O
. O

A O
person O
who O
is O
born O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
defective O
copy O
of O
a O
suppressor O
gene O
, O
or O
in O
whom O
one B-CARDINAL
copy O
is O
damaged O
early O
in O
life O
, O
is O
especially O
prone O
to O
cancer O
because O
he O
need O
only O
lose O
the O
other O
copy O
for O
a O
cancer O
to O
develop O
. O

Emerging O
genetic O
tests O
will O
be O
able O
to O
spot O
such O
cancer O

susceptible O
individuals O

what O

Mr. O
Quinlan B-PERSON
, O
30 B-DATE
years I-DATE
old I-DATE
, O
knew O
he O
carried O
a O
damaged O

lost O
an O

the O
rare O

when O
he O
was O
only B-DATE
two I-DATE

old I-DATE
-- O
after O
his O
mother O
had O
suffered O
the O
same O
fate O
when O
she O
was O
a O
baby O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
isolation O
of O
the O
retinoblastoma O
tumor O
- O
suppressor O
gene O
, O
it O
became O
possible O
last B-DATE
January I-DATE
to O
find O
out O
what O
threat O
the O
Quinlan B-PERSON
baby O
faced O
. O

A O
test O
using O
new O
`` O
genetic O
probes O
'' O
showed O
that O
little O
Will B-PERSON
Quinlan I-PERSON
had O
not O
inherited O
a O
damaged O
retinoblastoma O
supressor O
gene O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
faced O
no O
more O
risk O
than O
other O
children O
of O
developing O
the O
rare O
cancer O
. O

`` O
It O
made O
our O
New B-DATE
Year I-DATE
, O
'' O
says O
Mr. O
Quinlan B-PERSON
. O

This O
test O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
predict O
reliably O
whether O
an O
individual O
could O
expect O
to O
develop O
cancer O
. O

Equally O
important O
, O
the O
initial O
discovery O
of O
the O
gene O
that O
controls O
retinal O
cell O
growth O
, O
made O
by O
a O
Boston B-GPE
doctor O
named O
Thaddeus B-PERSON
Dryja I-PERSON
, O
has O
opened O
a O
field O
of O
cancer O
study O
, O
which O
in O
recent B-DATE
months I-DATE
has O
exploded O
. O

`` O
It O
turns O
out O
that O
studying O
a O
tragic O
but O
uncommon O
tumor O
made O
possible O
some O
fundamental O
insights O
about O
the O

'' O

`` O
All O
this O
may O
not O
be O

, O
which O

concerned O
about O

but O
I O
am O
convinced O
this O
basic O
research O
will O
begin O

there O
soon O

'' O

To O
date O
, O
scientists O
have O
fingered O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
cancer O
- O
suppressors O
. O

Dr. O
Dryja B-PERSON
made O
his O
retinoblastoma O
discovery O
in O
1986 B-DATE
. O

Then O
last B-DATE
spring I-DATE
, O
researchers O
reported O
finding O
a O
gene O
called O
p53 O
which O
, O
if O
impaired O
, O
turns O
healthy O
colon O
cells O
cancerous O
. O

Soon O
after O
that O
report O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
research O
teams O
uncovered O
evidence O
that O
the O
same O
damaged O
p53 O
gene O
is O
present O
in O
tissue O
from O
lung O
and O
breast O
cancers O
. O

Colon O
, O
lung O
and O
breast O
cancers O
are O
the O
most O
common O
and O
lethal O
forms O
of O
the O
disease O
, O
collectively O
killing O
almost B-CARDINAL
200,000 I-CARDINAL
Americans B-NORP
a O
year O
. O

Right B-TIME
now I-TIME
about B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
laboratories O
, O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
, O
Canada B-GPE
and O
Britain B-GPE
, O
are O
racing O
to O
unmask O
other O
suspected O
tumor O
- O
suppressing O
genes O
. O

They O
have O
about B-CARDINAL
seven I-CARDINAL
candidates O
. O

Researchers O
say O
the O
inactivation O
of O
tumor O
- O
suppressor O
genes O
, O
alone O
or O
in O
combination O
, O
appears O
crucial O
to O
the O
development O
of O
such O
scourges O
as O
cancer O
of O
the O
brain O
, O
the O
skin O
, O
kidney O
, O
prostate O
, O
and O
cervix O
. O

There O
is O
evidence O
that O
if O
people O
inherit O
defective O
versions O
of O
these O
genes O
, O
they O
are O
especially O
prone O
to O
cancer O
, O
perhaps O
explaining O
, O
finally O
, O
why O
some O
cancers O
seem O
to O
haunt O
certain O
families O
. O

The O
story O
of O
tumor O
- O
suppressor O
genes O
goes O
back O
to O
the O
1970s B-DATE
, O
when O
a O
pediatrician O
named O
Alfred B-PERSON
G. I-PERSON
Knudson I-PERSON
Jr. I-PERSON
proposed O
that O
retinoblastoma O
stemmed O
from O
two O
separate O
genetic O
defects O
. O

He O
theorized O
that O
in O
the O
eye O
cancer O
, O
an O
infant O
inherited O
a O
damaged O
copy O
of O
a O
gene O
from O
one O
parent O
and O
a O
normal O
copy O
from O
the O
other O
. O

The O
tumor O
, O
he O
suggested O
, O
developed O
when O
the O
second O
, O
normal O
copy O
also O
was O
damaged O
. O

But O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
prove O
Dr. O
Knudson B-PERSON
's O
`` O
two O
- O
hit O
'' O
theory O
. O

Back O
then O
, O
scientists O
had O
no O
way O
of O
ferreting O
out O
specific O
genes O
, O
but O
under O
a O
microscope O
they O
could O
see O
the O
23 B-CARDINAL
pairs O
of O
chromosomes O
in O
the O
cells O
that O
contain O
the O
genes O
. O

Occasionally O
, O
gross O
chromosome O
damage O
was O
visible O
. O

Dr. O
Knudson B-PERSON
found O
that O
some O
children O
with O
the O
eye O
cancer O
had O
inherited O
a O
damaged O
copy O
of O
chromosome O
No. O
13 B-CARDINAL
from O
a O
parent O
who O
had O
had O
the O
disease O
. O

Under O
a O
microscope O
he O
could O
actually O
see O
that O
a O
bit O
of O
chromosome O
13 B-CARDINAL
was O
missing O
. O

He O
assumed O
the O
missing O
piece O
contained O
a O
gene O
or O
genes O
whose O
loss O
had O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
setting O
off O
the O
cancer O
. O

But O
he O
did O
n't O
know O
which O
gene O
or O
genes O
had O
disappeared O
. O

Then O
, O
a O
scientific O
team O
led O
by O
molecular O
geneticist O
Webster B-PERSON
Cavenee I-PERSON
, O
then O
at O
the B-ORG
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Utah I-ORG
, O
found O
the O
answer O
. O

The O
team O
used O
a O
battery O
of O
the O
newly O
developed O
`` O
gene O
probes O
, O
'' O
snippets O
of O
genetic O
material O
that O
can O
track O
a O
gene O
's O
presence O
in O
a O
cell O
. O

By O
analyzing O
cells O
extracted O
from O
eye O
tumors O
, O
they O
found O
defects O
in O
the O
second O
copy O
of O
chromosome O
13 B-CARDINAL
in O
the O
exact O
area O
as O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
copy O
of O
the O
chromosome O
. O

The O
finding O
riveted O
medicine O
. O

It O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
anyone O
had O
showed O
that O
the O
loss O
of O
both O
copies O
of O
the O
same O
gene O
could O
lead O
to O
the O
eruption O
of O
a O
cancer O
. O

`` O
It O
was O
extraordinarily O
satisfying O
, O
'' O
says O
Dr. O
Knudson B-PERSON
, O
now O
at O
Fox B-ORG
Chase I-ORG
Cancer I-ORG
Research I-ORG
Center I-ORG
in O
Philadelphia B-GPE
. O

`` O
I O
was O
convinced O
that O
what O
was O
true O
of O
retinoblastoma O
would O
be O
true O
for O
all O
cancers O
. O
'' O

It O
was O
an O
audacious O
claim O
. O

But O
in O
Baltimore B-GPE
, O
Dr. O
Vogelstein B-PERSON
, O
a O
young O
molecular O
biologist O
at O
Johns B-ORG
Hopkins I-ORG
Medical I-ORG
School I-ORG
, O
believed O
Dr. O
Knudson B-PERSON
was O
right O
, O
and O
set O
out O
to O
repeat O
the O
Cavenee B-PERSON
experiment O
in O
cells O
from O
other O
cancers O
. O

His O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
two B-CARDINAL
research O
teams O
in O
1984 B-DATE
to O
report O
dual O
chromosome O
losses O
for O
a O
rare O
childhood O
cancer O
of O
the O
kidney O
called O
Wilm O
's O
tumor O
. O

Dr. O
Vogelstein B-PERSON
next O
turned O
his O
attention O
to O
colon O
cancer O
, O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
biggest O
cancer O
killer O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
after O
lung O
cancer O
. O

He O
believed O
colon O
cancer O
might O
also O
arise O
from O
multiple O
`` O
hits O
'' O
on O
cancer O
suppressor O
genes O
, O
because O
it O
often O
seems O
to O
develop O
in O
stages O
. O

It O
often O
is O
preceded O
by O
the O
development O
of O
polyps O
in O
the O
bowel O
, O
which O
in O
some O
cases O
become O
increasingly O
malignant O
in O
identifiable O
stages O
-- O
progressing O
from O
less O
severe O
to O
deadly O
-- O
as O
though O
a O
cascade O
of O
genetic O
damage O
might O
be O
occurring O
. O

Dr. O
Vogelstein B-PERSON
and O
a O
doctoral O
student O
, O
Eric B-PERSON
Fearon I-PERSON
, O
began O
months B-DATE
of O
tedious O
and O
often O
frustrating O
probing O
of O
the O
chromosomes O
searching O
for O
signs O
of O
genetic O
damage O
. O

They O
began O
uncovering O
a O
confusing O
variety O
of O
genetic O
deletions O
, O
some O
existing O
only O
in O
benign O
polyps O
, O
others O
in O
malignant O
cells O
and O
many O
in O
both O
polyps O
and O
malignant O
cells O
. O

Gradually O
, O
a O
coherent O
picture O
of O
cancer O
development O
emerged O
. O

If O
both O
copies O
of O
a O
certain O
gene O
were O
knocked O
out O
, O
benign O
polyps O
would O
develop O
. O

If O
both O
copies O
of O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
gene O
were O
then O
deleted O
, O
the O
polyps O
would O
progress O
to O
malignancy O
. O

It O
was O
clear O
that O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
gene O
had O
to O
be O
damaged O
for O
colon O
cancer O
to O
develop O
. O

Their O
report O
galvanized O
other O
molecular O
biologists O
. O

`` O
It O
was O
the O
confirming O
evidence O
we O
all O
needed O
that O
-LCB- O
gene O
-RCB- O
losses O
were O
critical O
to O
the O
development O
of O
a O
common O

Ray B-PERSON
White I-PERSON
at O
Howard B-ORG
Hughes I-ORG
Medical I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
in O
Salt B-GPE
Lake I-GPE
City I-GPE
. O

But O
Dr. O
Vogelstein B-PERSON
had O
yet O
to O
nail O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
gene O
that O
, O
if O
damaged O
, O
flipped O
a O
colon O
cell O
into O
full O
- O
blown O
malignancy O
. O

They O
focused O
on O
chromosome O
17 B-CARDINAL
. O

For O
months O
the O
Johns B-ORG
Hopkins I-ORG
researchers O
, O
using O
gene O
probes O
, O
experimentally O
crawled O
down O
the O
length O
of O
chromosome O
17 B-CARDINAL
, O
looking O
for O
the O
smallest O
common O
bit O
of O
genetic O
material O
lost O
in O
all O
tumor O
cells O
. O

Such O
a O
piece O
of O
DNA O
would O
probably O
constitute O
a O
gene O
. O

When O
they O
found O
it O
last B-DATE
winter I-DATE
, O
Dr. O
Vogelstein B-PERSON
was O
dubious O
that O
the O
search O
was O
over O
. O

His O
doubts O
stemmed O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
earlier I-DATE
a O
Princeton B-ORG
University I-ORG
researcher O
, O
Arnold B-PERSON
Levine I-PERSON
, O
had O
found O
in O
experiments O
with O
mice O
that O
a O
gene O
called O
p53 O
could O
transform O
normal O
cells O
into O
cancerous O
ones O
. O

The O
deletion O
Dr. O
Vogelstein B-PERSON
found O
was O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
spot O
as O
p53 O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Levine B-PERSON
had O
said O
the O
p53 O
gene O
caused O
cancer O
by O
promoting O
growth O
, O
whereas O
the O
Johns B-ORG
Hopkins I-ORG
scientists O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
gene O
that O
suppressed O
growth O
. O

Despite O
that O
, O
when O
the O
Johns B-ORG
Hopkins I-ORG
scientists O
compared O
the O
gene O
they O
had O
found O
in O
the O
human O
cancer O
cells O
with O
the O
Mr. O
Levine B-PERSON
's O
p53 O
gene O
they O
found O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
were O
identical O
; O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
in O
Mr. O
Levine B-PERSON
's O
cancer O
studies O
, O
he O
had O
unknowingly O
been O
observing O
a O
damaged O
form O
of O
p53 O
-- O
a O
cancer O
- O
suppressing O
gene O
. O

The O
discovery O
`` O
suddenly O
puts O
an O
obscure O
gene O
right O
in O
the O

formation O

at O

Evidence O
now O
is O
emerging O
that O
the O
p53 O
suppressor O
gene O
is O
involved O
in O
other O

Researchers O
in O
Edinburgh B-GPE

have O
found O
that O
in O
23 B-CARDINAL
of O
38 B-CARDINAL
breast O
tumors O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
copy O
of O
chromosome O
17 B-CARDINAL
was O
mutated O
at O
the O
spot O
where O
gene O
p53 O
lies O
. O

The O
scientists O
say O
that O
since O
breast O
cancer O
often O
strikes O
multiple O
members O
of O
certain O
families O
, O
the O
gene O
, O
when O
inherited O

form O
, O
may O
predispose O
women O
to O
the O
cancer O

The O
p53 O
gene O
has O
just O
been O
implicated O

John B-PERSON

that O
about B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
the O

Walter B-PERSON
Bodmer I-PERSON
, O
a O

, O
are O
close O
to O
finding O
another O

involved O
with O
some O
types O
of O
colon O
cancer O
, O
thought O
to O
be O
on O
chromosome O
5 B-CARDINAL

Dr. O
Minna B-PERSON
believes O
people O
who O
inherit O
a O
defective O
gene O
somewhere O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
their O
two B-CARDINAL
copies O
of O

3 B-CARDINAL
are O
especially O
prone O
to O
lung O

. O

Recently O
, O
he O

reported O
that O
the O
retinoblastoma O

as O

Some O

say O
new O

to O
slow O

growth O
may O
be O
based O
on O
the O

proteins O

The O
idea O
would O
be O
to O
administer O
to O
patients O
the O
growth O

controlling O
proteins O
made O
by O
healthy O
versions O

It O
may O
even O

to O
say O
, O
he O
was O
talking O
about O
RICO B-LAW
. O

With O
its O
recently O
revised O
guidelines O
for O
RICO B-LAW
, O
Justice B-ORG
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
law O
currently O
holds O
too O
many O
incentives O
for O
abuse O
by O
prosecutors O
. O

The O
text O
of O
the O
`` O
new O
policy O
'' O
guidelines O
from O
the B-ORG
Criminal I-ORG
Division I-ORG
are O
reprinted O
nearby O
. O

They O
strongly O
suggest O
that O
Justice B-ORG
's O
prosecutions O
of O
Drexel B-ORG
Burnham I-ORG
Lambert I-ORG
, O
Michael B-PERSON
Milken I-PERSON
and O
Princeton B-ORG
/ I-ORG
Newport I-ORG
violated O
notions O
of O
fundamental O
fairness O
. O

Justice B-ORG
is O
attempting O
to O
avoid O
a O
replay O
of O
these O
tactics O
. O

This O
amounts O
to O
an O
extraordinary O
repudiation O
of O
the O
tenure O
of O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
mayoral O
candidate O
and O
former O
U.S. B-GPE
Attorney O
Rudolph B-PERSON
Giuliani I-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
more O
inclined O
to O
gathering O
scalps O
than O
understanding O
markets O
. O

The O
new O
guidelines O
limit O
the O
pretrial O
forfeitures O
of O
assets O
of O
RICOed O
defendants O
and O
their O
investors O
, O
clients O
, O
bankers O
and O
others O
. O

This O
follows O
earlier O
new O
guidelines O
from O
the B-ORG
Tax I-ORG
Division I-ORG
prohibiting O
Princeton B-ORG
/ I-ORG
Newport I-ORG
- O
like O
tax O
cases O
from O
masquerading O
as O
RICO B-LAW
cases O
. O

The O
forfeiture O
memo O
cited O
`` O
considerable O
criticism O
in O
the O
press O
, O
because O
of O
a O
perception O
that O
pre-trial O
freezing O
of O
assets O
is O
tantamount O
to O
a O
seizure O
of O
property O
without O
due O
process O
. O
'' O

It O
told O
prosecutors O
not O
to O
seek O
forfeitures O
if O
there O
are O
`` O
less O
intrusive O
'' O
alternatives O
, O
such O
as O
bonds O
, O
and O
in O
any O
case O
not O
to O
seek O
forfeitures O
`` O
disproportionate O
to O
the O
defendant O
's O
crime O
. O
'' O

These O
changes O
come O
a O
tad O
late O
for O
Princeton B-ORG
/ I-ORG
Newport I-ORG
, O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
RICOed O
securities O
firm O
. O

It O
was O
forced O
into O
liquidation O
before O
trial O
when O
investors O
yanked O
their O
funds O
after O
the O
government O
demanded O
a O
huge O
pre-trial O
asset O
forfeiture O
. O

Princeton B-ORG
/ I-ORG
Newport I-ORG
investors O
, O
including O
McKinsey B-ORG
-AMP- I-ORG
Co. I-ORG
and O
the O
Harvard B-ORG
endowment O
, O
made O
the O
rational O
decision O
to O
withdraw O
their O
money O
; O
for O
the O
firm O
, O
the O
liquidation O
was O
sentence O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
verdict O
later O
. O

Prosecutors O
wanted O
$ B-MONEY
23.8 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
in O
forfeiture O
for O
alleged O
tax O
fraud O
of O
some B-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
400,000 I-MONEY
. O

The O
experience O
of O
Princeton B-ORG
/ I-ORG
Newport I-ORG
and O
initiation O
of O
other O
RICO B-LAW
- O
forfeiture O
cases O
against O
legitimate O
businesses O
taught O
Drexel B-ORG
that O
a O
RICOed O
investment O
bank O
would O
be O
an O
ex-investment O
bank O
. O

Drexel B-ORG
therefore O
agreed O
instead O
to O
an O
arrangement O
allowing O
it O
to O
plea O
to O
charges O
`` O
which O
the O
company O
is O
not O
in O
a O
position O
to O
dispute O
'' O
because O
of O
RICO B-LAW
. O

Part O
of O
Drexel B-ORG
's O
plea O
was O
to O
cut O
Mr. O
Milken B-PERSON
loose O
. O

So O
after O
all O
the O
prosecutorial O
hoopla O
no O
one O
has O
established O
what O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
Drexel B-ORG
did O
wrong O
. O

So O
two B-CARDINAL
cheers O
for O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

Justice B-ORG
has O
finally O
recognized O
its O
employees O
' O
abuses O
, O
thanks O
largely O
to O
the O
demands O
for O
reform O
by O
former O
U.S. B-GPE
attorney O
in O
Washington B-GPE
Joseph B-PERSON
diGenova I-PERSON
, O
who O
wants O
to O
salvage O
RICO B-LAW
for O
real O
criminals O
. O

But O
prosecutorial O
guidelines O
are O
effective O
only O
if O
someone O
at O
Justice B-ORG
is O
willing O
and O
able O
to O
supervise O
hyperactive O
prosecutors O
. O

Judge O
Sentelle B-PERSON
, O
of O
the O
appeals O
court O
in O
Washington B-GPE
, O
made O
this O
point O
at O

for O

Justice O
should O
review O
these O
cases O
to O
see O
what O
other O
prosecutorial O
abuses O
may O
have O
occurred O
. O

We O
suspect O
that O
Justice B-ORG
will O
some B-DATE
day I-DATE
agree O
that O
only O

His O
Highness O
the B-PERSON
Oil I-PERSON
Minister I-PERSON
has O
very O
clearly O
clarified O
that O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
is O
established O
on O
balance O
in O
the O
oil O
market O
. O

The O
Kingdom B-GPE
has O
historically O
proven O
that O
in O
times O
of O
crisis O
, O
it O
does O
what O
it O
should O
do O
as O
the O
biggest O
producer O
of O
oil O
, O
in O
a O
way O
that O
guarantees O
the O
stability O
of O
the O
oil O
markets O
. O

As O
for O
the O
nuclear O
program O
which O
the B-ORG
Gulf I-ORG
Cooperation I-ORG
Council I-ORG
has O
approved O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
among O
the O
most O
important O
reasons O
on O
which O
the O
Council B-ORG
agreed O
in O
this O
framework O
is O
to O
enter O
in O
this O
important O
industry O
, O
the O
importance O
of O
which O
not O
only O
includes O
a O
military O
aspect O
, O
but O
also O
a O
peaceful O
aspect O
, O
in O
order O
to O
establish O
an O
industry O
subject O
to O
strict O
controls O
that O
can O
not O
be O
violated O
, O
in O
order O
to O
guarantee O
its O
peaceful O
direction O
. O

And O
it O
may O
be O
an O
example O
for O
all O
who O
want O
to O
have O
this O
industry O
and O
have O
no O
intention O
of O
developing O
it O
, O
other O
than O
establishing O
nuclear O

. O

This O
is O
the O

No O

the O

reading O

differs O
from O
the O

the O

made O
at O
that O

The O
political O
situation O
of O
the O
world O
today O
has O
even O
become O
more O
complicated O
than O
before O
. O

It O
ca O
n't O
be O
said O
that O
any O
oil O
producing O

can O
use O
oil O
as O
a O
weapon O
to O
impose O
a O
certain O
political O
vision O
or O
political O
position O

It O
may O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
reasons O
that O
the O
American B-NORP

in O

today O
has O
become O

In O

not O
choosing O

to O

called O

the B-WORK_OF_ART
Car I-WORK_OF_ART

. O
" O

Each O
issue O
includes O
an O
interview O
with O
a O
young O
athlete O
, O
actor O
or O
singer O
, O
who O
talks O
about O
his O
personal O
relationship O
with O
the O

. O

Each O
interview O
ends O
with O
a O
final O
question O
: O
" O
What O
is O
your O
opinion O
about O
women O
driving O
cars O
? O
" O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
was O
not O
expecting O
those O
answers O
from O
those O
people O
who O
are O
not O
exactly O
- O
in O
my O
opinion O
- O
classified O
as O
intellectuals O
or O
people O
holding O
ideologies O
, O
but O
rather O
are O
common O
people O
. O

I O
was O
not O
expecting O
those O
answers O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
intensive O
pressure O
and O
the O
attack O
launched O
by O
our O
local O
press O
, O
which O
has O
a O
bias O
for O
the O
liberal O
current O
, O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
endorse O
women O
driving O
. O

I O
believe O
it O
is O
not O
love O
and O
concern O
for O
women O
as O
much O
as O
this O
decision O
is O
the O
dream O
to O
pave O
the O
way O
for O
other O
horizons O
and O
projects O
to O
liberate O
women O
and O
walk O
on O
the O
path O
of O
westernization O
. O

Our O
attempt O
, O
as O
conservatives O
, O
to O
stand O
up O
against O
issues O
such O
as O
these O
must O
not O
be O
satisfied O
with O
only O
the O
fatwas O
of O
important O
scholars O
, O
but O
we O
must O
employ O
other O
means O
. O

I O
liked O
one B-CARDINAL
cartoonist O
who O
depicted O
the O
situation O
of O
a O
woman O
in O
her O
car O
while O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
tires O
failed O
, O
and O
how O
a O
young O
man O
came O
to O
rescue O
her O
. O

Above O
his O
head O
hearts O
of O
love O
and O
infatuation O
were O
drawn O
. O

This O
cartoonist O
supported O
the O
issue O
with O
his O
brush O
and O
depicted O
how O
danger O
lurks O
if O
it O
is O
endorsed O
. O

Now O
we O
are O
in O
need O
of O
such O
ideas O
more O
than O
we O
need O
rhetorical O
speeches O
that O
people O
are O
fed O
up O
with O
. O

Since O
I O
think O
that O
publishing O
the O
statements O
made O
by O
athletes O
, O
actors O
, O
and O
singers O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
to O
help O
us O
to O
serve O
this O
cause O
, O
and O
since O
these O
interviews O
came O
through O
the O
newspaper O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Jazirah I-ORG
, O
I O
think O
that O
if O
they O
had O
been O
published O
by O
the O
newspaper O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Watan I-ORG
or O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Riyadh I-ORG
they O
would O
have O
stopped O
this O
question O
from O
being O
asked O
to O
the O
guest O
because O
they O
are O
known O
for O
their O
banning O
of O
the O
other O
and O
they O
do O
not O
know O
neutrality O
when O
exposing O
and O
they O
do O
not O
like O
these O
answers O
. O
As O
it O
happened O
with O
the O
newspaper O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Riyadh I-ORG
when O
it O
halted O
and O
concealed O
the O
poll O
on O
women O
driving O
as O
it O
saw O
the O
overwhelming O
victory O
of O
those O
opposed O
. O

I O
leave O
you O
with O
the O
answers O
of O
the O
Car B-WORK_OF_ART
Club I-WORK_OF_ART
magazine O
guests O
to O
see O
that O
there O
is O
not O
one B-CARDINAL

he O
was O

when O
Mr. O

it O

he O

Mr. O

claims O
he O
reminded O
Mr. O

that O
Robert B-PERSON

Terry B-PERSON
Semel I-PERSON
, O
the O
top O

as O

In O
response O
, O
Mr. O

, O
Mr. O
Ross B-PERSON
referred O
to O
his O
colleagues O
at O
Warner B-ORG
with O
an O
`` O

said O

`` O
Tell O

Warner B-ORG
denies O
Mr. O

denies O
virtually O
everything O
Mr. O

say O
in O
their O

Tomorrow B-DATE
, O
Warner B-ORG
will O
file O
another O

documents O
contending O
that O
`` O
the O

Thursday B-DATE

a O

block O
the O

provide O
a O
peek O
into O
the O
inner O
workings O
of O
this O
Hollywood B-GPE
dogfight O
. O

But O
they O
also O
make O
it O
clear O
that O
the O
first O
thing O
a O
judge O
will O
have O
to O
decide O
is O
which O
, O
if O
any O
, O
version O
of O
events O
in O
this O
morass O
is O
fiction O
, O
and O
which O
fact O
. O

The O
matter O
may O
never O
even O
be O
tried O
in O
court O
. O

Warner B-ORG
says O
that O
what O
it O
really O
wants O
is O
for O
the O
producers O
to O
fulfill O
their O
contractual O
obligations O
, O
but O
the O
bitterness O
of O
this O
battle O
and O
the O
accusations O
flying O
on O
both O
sides O
make O
it O
unlikely O
that O
the O
decade B-DATE
- I-DATE
long I-DATE
relationship O
between O
Warner B-ORG
and O
its O
two B-CARDINAL
most O
prolific O
producers O
can O
ever O
be O
repaired O
. O

Warner B-ORG
, O
which O
is O
in O
the O
process O
of O
merging O
with O
Time B-ORG
Warner I-ORG
Inc. I-ORG
, O
says O
it O
is O
willing O
to O
settle O
the O
matter O
out O
of O
court O
. O

So O
far O
, O
however O
, O
Sony B-ORG
has O
n't O
been O
willing O
to O
meet O
its O
considerable O
financial O
demands O
. O

Mr. O
Guber B-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Peters B-PERSON
do O
n't O
have O
much O
to O
gain O
from O
a O
protracted O
battle O
. O

Sony B-ORG
, O
for O
its O
part O
, O
could O
decide O
that O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
Warner B-ORG
settlement O
or O
court O
fight O
is O
too O
high O
, O
choosing O
instead O
to O
find O
someone O
else O
to O
run O
Columbia B-ORG
, O
although O
that O
too O
would O
be O
costly O
given O
the O
financial O
arrangement O
already O
guaranteed O
to O
Mr. O
Guber B-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Peters B-PERSON
. O

In O
that O
case O
, O
Mr. O
Guber B-PERSON
and O
Mr. O
Peters B-PERSON
might O
not O
suffer O
financially O
, O
but O
they O
would O
be O
left O
without O
their O
dream O
job O
of O
running O
a O
studio O
and O
with O
a O
considerably O
scarred O
relationship O
with O
Warner B-ORG
. O

At O
the O
center O
of O
any O
court O
fight O
will O
be O
the O
differing O
interpretations O
of O
the O
written O
contract O
between O
Warner B-ORG
and O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
producers O
, O
but O
other O
murkier O
issues O
will O
play O
a O
big O
role O
. O

Sony B-ORG
and O
the O
Guber B-ORG
- I-ORG
Peters I-ORG
team O
are O
hanging O
much O
of O
their O
case O
on O
Warner B-ORG
's O
willingness O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
to O
release O
the O
producers O
from O
another O
contract O
and O
on O
an O
oral O
agreement O
they O
say O
allowed O
them O
to O
terminate O
the O
current O
written O
contract O
if O
the O
opportunity O
to O
run O
a O
major O
studio O
came O
up O

Warner B-ORG
denies O
such O
an O
agreement O
was O
made O
, O
and O
disputes O
the O

version O
of O
virtually O
every O
telephone O
call O
and O
meeting O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
had O
on O
the O
matter O
. O

Just O
how O
rancorous O
the O
relationship O
has O
become O
is O
clear O
from O
the O
differing O
versions O
of O
the O

Mr. O

The O

side O

in O

Warner B-ORG

The O
MND B-ORG

However O
, O
it O
is O
widely O

that O
by O

there O
will O
be O
a O
shift O
in O
the O

of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O

Although O
this O
prediction O
is O
not O
necessarily O
accurate O
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
should O
work O

Fuh B-PERSON

offers O
the O
following O
analysis O
: O
Currently O
the O
PRC B-GPE
weapons O
which O
pose O
the O
greatest O
threat O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
are O
Sukhoi B-PRODUCT
aircraft I-PRODUCT
, O
M O
- O
class O
missiles O
, O
and O
cruise O
missiles O
. O

Of O
these O
, O
the O
aircraft O
are O
already O
strategically O
of O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
rank O
, O
but O
Taiwan B-GPE
must O
be O
alert O
to O
the O
missiles O
. O

The O
M O
- O
class O
weapons O
can O
pass O
through O
the O
stratosphere O
directly O
into O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
rear O
areas O
, O
while O
cruise O
missiles O
can O
undertake O
low O
- O
level O
long O
- O
range O
attacks O
. O

" O
We O
can O
defend O
against O
the O
M O
- O
class O
missiles O
with O
our O
Patriot O
missile O
defense O
system O
, O
but O
we O
currently O
have O
only O
limited O
ability O
to O
intercept O
cruise O
missiles O
. O

The O
most O
important O
subject O
for O
the O
moment O
is O
to O
rethink O
air O
defense O
strategy O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

Missile O
difficulties O

Any O
discussion O
of O
missiles O
also O
involves O
many O
other O
issues O
, O
including O
international O
strategy O
and O
domestic O
civilian O
morale O
. O

From O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
international O
strategy O
, O
the O
US B-GPE
clearly O
does O
not O
want O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
develop O
its O
own O
offensive O
missile O
capability O
. O

The O
US B-GPE
responded O
negatively O
to O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
proposal O
to O
build O
long O
- O
range O
missiles O
. O

At O
the B-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
's I-ORG
end O
- O
of O
- O
year O
press O
conference O
, O
US B-GPE
Under O
Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
for O
Arms O
Control O
John B-PERSON
Holum I-PERSON
said O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
did O
not O
want O
to O
see O
Taiwan B-GPE
take O
any O
action O
which O
would O
violate O
the O
basic O
norms O
of O
the O
1987 B-DATE
Missile B-ORG
Technology I-ORG
Control I-ORG
Regime I-ORG
. O

Thus O
the O
US B-GPE
would O
not O
be O
happy O
to O
see O
Taiwan B-GPE
develop O
offensive O
long O
- O
range O
missile O
systems O
. O

Kuo B-PERSON
Cheng I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
liang I-PERSON
, O
a O
professor O
of O
political O
science O
at O
Soochow B-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
says O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
opposes O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
development O
of O
long O
- O
range O
missiles O
because O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
's O
long O
- O
range O
strategy O
vis O
- O
a O
- O
vis O
China B-GPE
. O

The O
US B-GPE
has O
always O
been O
responsible O
for O
strategic O
deterrence O
, O
while O
Taiwan B-GPE
handles O
local O
tactical O
defense O
. O

If O
Taiwan B-GPE
were O
to O
develop O
long O
- O
range O
missiles O
, O
this O
would O
change O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
defensive O
posture O
, O
and O
alter O
the O
Taiwan B-GPE
- O
US B-GPE
military O
division O
of O
labor O
. O

There O
is O
another O
possibility O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
defending O
against O
the O
threat O
of O
missiles O
from O
the O
PRC B-GPE
. O

Besides O
building O
offensive O
systems O
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
could O
also O
join O
the O
US B-GPE
Theater B-ORG
Missile I-ORG
Defense I-ORG
-LRB- O
TMD B-ORG
-RRB- O
plan O
. O

But O
this O
may O
not O
be O
feasible O
, O
says O
Bih B-PERSON
Chung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
ho I-PERSON
, O
editor O
- O
in O
- O
chief O
of O
the O
defense O
magazine O
Defense B-ORG
Technology I-ORG
Monthly I-ORG
. O

He O
says O
that O
if O
Taiwan B-GPE
were O
to O
join O
the O
TMD B-ORG
this O
would O
be O
a O
return O
to O
a O
situation O
of O
joint O
US B-GPE
- O
Taiwan B-GPE
defense O
, O
such O
as O
existed O
during O
the B-EVENT
Cold I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
, O
when O
Taiwan B-GPE
was O
on O
the O
frontline O
in O
a O
chain O
of O
islands O
surrounding O
China B-GPE
. O

For O
the O
PRC B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
endeavoring O
to O
move O
from O
coastal O
defense O
to O
a O
blue O
- O
water O
capability O
, O
the O
provocation O
would O
be O
enormous O
. O

The B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
has O
thus O
been O
deliberately O
unclear O
- O
it O
does O
not O
exclude O
Taiwan B-GPE
from O
the O
TMD B-ORG
, O
but O
it O
has O
not O
clearly O
said O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
would O
be O
included O
. O

In O
any O
case O
, O
says O
Lin B-PERSON
Chong I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
pin I-PERSON
, O
vice-chairman O
of O
the O
ROC B-GPE
's O
Mainland B-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
potential O
TMD B-ORG
buyers O
still O
do O
not O
know O
where O
the O
money O
would O
come O
from O
, O
while O
the O
TMD B-ORG
producer O
has O
not O
yet O
come O
up O
with O
a O
finished O
product O
. O

So O
this O
is O
still O
just O
a O
political O
debating O
point O
, O
and O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
talk O
about O
any O
impact O
on O
the O
military O
situation O
in O
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
. O

Domestic O
morale O

Thus O
, O
from O
the O
international O
strategic O
angle O
, O
it O
still O
seems O
most O
practical O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
have O
its O
own O
missile O
systems O
. O

Moreover O
, O
this O
is O
also O
necessary O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
public O
opinion O
. O

In O
an O
analysis O
of O
the O
threat O
that O
guided O
missiles O
pose O
to O
morale O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
ROC B-GPE
Minister O
of O
Defense O
Tang B-PERSON
Fei I-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
perhaps O
for O
some O
countries O
a O
missile O
attack O
would O
have O
little O
impact O
. O

But O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
where O
resources O
are O
concentrated O
, O
missiles O
pose O
a O
serious O
threat O
to O
electrical O
power O
and O
petroleum O
production O
, O
to O
transportation O
-LRB- O
harbors O
, O
highways O
, O

, O

-RRB- O
, O
and O
to O
factories O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
he O
says O
, O
the O
citizens O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
are O
not O
psychologically O
prepared O
. O

There O
has O
been O
no O
war O
for O
decades B-DATE
now O
, O
and O
there O
are O
even O
very O
few O
usable O
civil O
defense O
shelters O
. O

If O
the O
PRC B-GPE
were O
to O
launch O
200 B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
300 I-CARDINAL
guided O
missiles O
against O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
although O
the O
damage O
to O
industry O
, O
power O
, O
and O
communications O
would O
probably O
not O
be O
as O
serious O
as O
was O
caused O
by O
the B-EVENT
September I-EVENT
21 I-EVENT
earthquake I-EVENT
, O
citizens O
are O
not O
psychologically O
prepared O
for O
war O
, O
and O
the O
economy O
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
withstand O
the O
assault O
. O

Chung B-PERSON
Chien I-PERSON
, O
an O
expert O
on O
military O
affairs O
, O
says O
that O
the O
turbulence O
created O
in O
the O
public O
mind O
by O
the O
1996 B-DATE
PRC B-GPE
missile O
tests O
has O
not O
abated O
even O
today B-DATE
. O

The O
construction O
of O
an O
effective O
missile O
defense O
system O
is O
the O
main O
military O
problem O
in O
bringing O
peace O
of O
mind O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
citizens O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
the O
presidential O
elections O
, O
although O
missile O
defense O
can O
not O
be O
said O
to O
be O
" O
the O

, O
it O
is O
still O
an O
important O
" O
side O

" O
that O
many O

are O
concerned O
about O

Beyond O

If O
Taiwan B-GPE
can O
not O
develop O
long O

or O
participate O
in O
the O

what O
effective O

are O
left O
? O

Fuh B-PERSON

out O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
domestically O
produced O
Sky B-PRODUCT
Bow I-PRODUCT
and O
Sky B-PRODUCT
Sword I-PRODUCT
missiles I-PRODUCT
have O
defensive O
capability O
. O

But O
pure O
defense O
is O
not O
enough O
. O

Even O
if O
missile O
defense O
could O
be O
99 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
effective O
, O
and O
only O
one O
percent O
of O

the O
situation O
could O
still O
be O
a O

Thus O
, O
it O
would O
be O
more O
effective O
to O
build O
an O

to O
deter O
the O

Taiwan B-GPE

According O

this O

For O

But O
Taiwan B-GPE

so O
there O

. O
" O

This O
newly O
established O
26th B-ORG
Fighter I-ORG
Squadron I-ORG
has O
18 B-CARDINAL
fighter O
aircraft O
, O
but O
less B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
pilots O
. O

According O
to O
the B-ORG
Air I-ORG
Force I-ORG
, O
this O
problem O
is O
the O
result O
of O
the O
transition O
period O
to O
a O
new O
generation O
of O
aircraft O
. O

For O
pilots O
to O
qualify O
for O
the O
new O
aircraft O
, O
they O
must O
have O
at B-TIME
least I-TIME
400 I-TIME
hours I-TIME
of O
flying O
experience O
. O

But O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
pilots O
get O
limited O
time O
in O
the O
air O
, O
so O
there O
are O
n't O
enough O
qualified O
pilots O
. O

Experts O
explain O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
limited O
airspace O
, O
and O
virtually O
no O
space O
for O
training O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
virtually O
all O
of O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
group O
of O
pilots O
who O
went O
abroad O
to O
receive O
training O
for O
new O
fighter O
aircraft O
have O
left O
the O
military O
to O
fly O
for O
civilian O
airlines O
, O
so O
the O
problem O
of O
talent O
outflows O
is O
severe O
. O

The O
same O
applies O
to O
other O
types O
of O
high O
- O
tech O
material O
. O

Doctrine O
, O
not O
weapons O

It O
is O
bad O
enough O
that O
high O
- O
tech O
weapons O
may O
be O
rendered O
irrelevant O
by O
the O
inability O
to O
utilize O
them O
properly O
. O

Another O
problem O
is O
that O
they O
might O
be O
bypassed O
altogether O
by O
a O
different O
enemy O
strategy O
. O

Alex B-PERSON
Kao I-PERSON
warns O
that O
currently O
both O
public O
commentators O
and O
the O
military O
's O
own O
research O
focus O
on O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
wave O
of O
warfare O
in O
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
will O
be O
a O
missile O
attack O
. O

This O
ignores O
the O
evolution O
of O
land O
- O
sea O
- O
air O
joint O
operations O
in O
modern O
warfare O
. O

Mainland O
China B-GPE
need O
not O
choose O
to O
use O
high O
- O
cost O
, O
limited O
- O
quantity O
guided O
missiles O
, O
but O
could O
instead O
use O
a O
large O
number O
of O
360 B-QUANTITY

km I-QUANTITY
range O
rockets O
to O
first B-ORDINAL
attack O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
air O
fields O
from O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
coast O
, O
thereby O
paralyzing O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
air O
superiority O
. O

Then O
, O
their O
navy O
could O
ferry O
raiders O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
less B-TIME
than I-TIME
one I-TIME
hour I-TIME
. O

Kao B-PERSON
recalls O
that O
Vietnamese B-NORP
land O
forces O
were O
used O
to O
infiltrate O
US B-GPE
air O
fields O
in O
Vietnam B-GPE
and O
neutralize O
American B-NORP
air O
superiority O
. O

Particularly O
now O
that O
the B-LAW
Coastal I-LAW
Defense I-LAW
Law I-LAW
has O
been O
passed O
, O
and O
responsibility O
for O
coastal O
patrols O
will O
pass O
to O
the O
non-military O
Coast B-ORG
Guard I-ORG
Command I-ORG
, O
if O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
military O
still O
operates O
under O
the O
traditional O
assumption O
of O
first O
establishing O
air O
and O
sea O
superiority O
followed O
by O
defense O
on O
land O
, O
this O
could O
give O
mainland O
China B-GPE
an O
opportunity O
to O
strike O
a O
death O
blow O
. O

" O
Although O
this O
is O
merely O
a O
hypothesis O
, O
it O
points O
to O
a O
blind O
spot O
: O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
strike O
will O
not O
necessarily O
be O
missiles O
. O

A O
solid O

requires O
that O
no O

Third B-ORDINAL

Even O
as O

, O
an O
unprecedented O
form O

says O
that O
currently O
both O

in O
third B-ORDINAL
- O

- O
warfare O
development O
. O

This O
type O
of O
warfare O
is O
divided O
into O
" O
hard O
kill O
" O
and O
" O
soft O
kill O
. O
" O

Hard O
kill O
refers O
to O
the O
deployment O
on O
missile O
warheads O
of O
weapons O
with O
directional O
capability O
- O
using O
, O
for O
example O
, O
lasers O
, O
microwaves O
, O
electromagnetic O
pulse O
, O
and O
particle O
beams O
- O
which O
could O
increase O
the O
destructiveness O
of O

. O

" O
Soft O
kill O
" O
refers O
to O
computer O
viruses O
and O
electronic O
interference O
to O
destroy O
the O
enemy O

computer O
systems O
, O
and O
thereby O
to O
neutralize O
the O
enemy O
's O
military O
capability O
in O
a O
bloodless O
manner O
. O

Some O
people O
see O
in O
third B-ORDINAL
- O
wave O
warfare O
an O
opportunity O
to O
seize O
a O
decisive O
advantage O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
future O
armed O
threat O
from O
mainland O
China B-GPE
. O

To O
be O
sure O
, O
because O
of O
the O
domestic O
development O
of O
the O
electronics O
industry O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
the O
ROC B-GPE
has O
a O
certain O
advantage O
. O

The O
military O
is O
currently O
actively O
studying O
the O
construction O
of O
information O
war O
capability O
, O
and O
it O
hopes O
to O
cooperate O
with O
the O
private O
sector O
and O
utilize O
private O
- O
sector O
computer O
knowledge O
to O
jointly O
deploy O
an O
electronics O
defense O
network O
. O

This O
is O
a O
key O
area O
of O
development O
for O
the O
future O
in O
which O
Taiwan B-GPE
can O
rely O
on O
itself O
and O
need O
not O
be O
limited O
by O
what O
can O
be O
procured O
abroad O
. O

Construction O
of O
a O
complete O
defense O
system O
is O
essential O
, O
but O
the O
highest O
form O
of O
military O
strategy O
is O
still O
to O
defeat O
the O
enemy O
without O
firing O
a O
shot O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
pro-active O
defense O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
currently O
studying O
is O
a O
way O
of O
pursuing O
peace O
. O

Taiwan B-GPE
will O
not O
provoke O
mainland O
China B-GPE
, O
nor O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
resort O
to O
war O
. O

But O
nor O
can O
it O
allow O
the O
PRC B-GPE
to O
think O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
so O
weak O
that O
the O
PRC B-GPE
will O
be O
tempted O
to O
act O
rashly O
. O

Pro-active O
defense O
is O
necessary O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
but O
the O
real O
goal O
of O
the O
Taiwan B-GPE
side O
is O
peace O
. O

Perhaps O
militarily O
there O
's O
a O
standoff O
situation O
of O
mutual O
intimidation O
, O
but O
what O
Taiwan B-GPE
most O
hopes O
for O
is O
that O
the O
cross-strait O
problem O
can O
be O
peacefully O
resolved O
without O
deploying O
a O
single O
soldier O
. O

C.J.B. B-PERSON

Mr. O
Baldwin B-PERSON
is O
also O
attacking O
the O
greater O
problem O
: O
lack O
of O

One O
survey O
says O
that O

today B-DATE
, O
only B-CARDINAL
40,000 I-CARDINAL

, O

But O
the O

only O
partly O
successful O

says O

`` O

One B-CARDINAL

Researcher O
Andrew B-PERSON
Levi I-PERSON
says O
scientists O
have O
long O
been O
puzzled O
by O
the O
question O
of O
which O
diabetics O
develop O
complications O
and O
why O
. O

We O
know O
that O
the O
complications O
are O
directly O
related O
to O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
is O
how O
long O
you O
've O
had O
the O
diabetes O
, O
how O
well O
you O
've O
been O
controlled O
, O
but O
it O
's O
clear O
that O
people O
with O
the O
same O
level O
of O
control O
of O
their O
glucose O
, O
same O
duration O
of O
the O
diabetes O
differ O
dramatically O
in O
their O
susceptibility O
to O
these O
complications O
that O
are O
so O
devastating O
. O

Dr. O
Levi B-PERSON
says O
one B-CARDINAL
third I-CARDINAL
of O
insulin O
taking O
patients O
ends O
up O
with O
kidney O
failure O
and O
80 B-PERCENT

Scientists O
have O
suspected O
there O
must O
be O
something O
different O
about O
the O
genetic O
make O
- O
up O
of O
diabetics O
who O
develop O
complications O
; O
and O
that O
difference O
may O
have O
to O
do O
with O
haptoglobin O
, O
a O
protein O
whose O
function O
is O
to O
mop O
up O
blood O
vessel O
destroying O
free O

. O

The O
free O

are O
released O
when O
oxygen O

die O
. O

Andrew B-PERSON
Levi I-PERSON
says O
there O
are O
three B-CARDINAL

haptoglobin O
and O
he O
and O
his O
colleagues O

that O
one B-CARDINAL

the O

I O

this O

also O
, O
doctor O

of O
one O

the O

that O
was O

uh O

where O
it O
indicated O
that O
dividing O
the O

after O
the B-EVENT
Second I-EVENT
World I-EVENT

was O
not O
successful O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
we O
are O
witnessing O
today O
the O
repercussions O
of O
this O
division O
, O
which O
did O
not O
take O
into O
consideration O
sectarian O
geography O
, O
if O
the O
expression O
is O
right O
. O

What O
is O
your O
comment O
? O

The O
reality O
is O
that O
the O
Sykes B-PERSON
- O
Picot B-PERSON
case O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
when O
it O
was O
set O
, O
only O
paid O
attention O
to O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
countries O
and O
the O
outcome O
, O
ah O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
balance O
of O
power O
among O
them O
, O
that O
is O
, O
between O
France B-GPE
in O
the O
first O
place O
and O
, O
and O
, O
and O
Britain B-GPE
or O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
Kingdom I-GPE
. O

But O
now O
, O
we O
see O
that O
there O
are O
divisions O
being O
confirmed O
inside O
the O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
. O

In O
reality O
, O
they O
serve O
a O
-- O
the O
main O
, O
Israeli B-NORP
goal O
, O
which O
is O
to O
change O
the O
region O
into O
, O
ah O
, O
a O

of O
small O
countries O
based O
on O
denominational O

, O
or O

Yes O
. O

So O
we O
see O
that O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Iraq B-GPE

in O

, O
ah O
, O
under O

the B-GPE

we O

`` O
As O
you O
know O
, O
I O
usually O
provide O
the O
scientific O
and O
technological O
`` O
entertainment O
'' O
in O
our O
meetings O
, O
but O
, O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
our O
Chairman O
suggested O
that O
I O
present O
my O
own O
personal O
view O
on O
events O
in O
the O
part O
of O
the O
world O
from O
which O
I O
come O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
and O
I O
will O
never O
be O
a O
Government B-ORG
official O
and O
I O
have O
no O
privileged O
information O
. O

My O
perspective O
is O
entirely O
based O
on O
what O
I O
see O
, O
on O
what O
I O
read O
and O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
family O
has O
lived O
in O
this O
region O
for O
almost B-DATE
200 I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

You O
may O
regard O
my O
views O
as O
those O
of O
the O
proverbial O
taxi O
driver O
, O
which O
you O
are O
supposed O
to O
question O
, O
when O
you O
visit O
a O
country O
. O

I O
could O
have O
shared O
with O
you O
some O
fascinating O
facts O
and O
some O
personal O
thoughts O
about O
the B-EVENT
Israeli I-EVENT
- I-EVENT
Arab I-EVENT
conflict I-EVENT
. O

However O
, O
I O
will O
touch O
upon O
it O
only O
in O
passing O
. O

I O
prefer O
to O
devote O
most O
of O
my O
remarks O
to O
the O
broader O
picture O
of O
the O
region O
and O
its O
place O
in O
world O
events O
. O

I O
refer O
to O
the O
entire O
area O
between O
Pakistan B-GPE
and O
Morocco B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
predominantly O
Arab B-NORP
, O
predominantly O
Moslem B-NORP
, O
but O
includes O
many O
non-Arab B-NORP
and O
also O
significant O
non-Moslem B-NORP
minorities O
. O

Why O
do O
I O
put O
aside O
Israel B-GPE
and O
its O
own O
immediate O
neighborhood O
? O

Because O
Israel B-GPE
and O
any O
problems O
related O
to O
it O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
what O
you O
might O
read O
or O
hear O
in O
the O
world O
media O
, O
is O
not O
the O
central O
issue O
, O
and O
has O
never O
been O
the O
central O
issue O
in O
the O
upheaval O
in O
the O
region O
. O

Yes O
, O
there O
is O
a O
100 B-DATE
year I-DATE

old I-DATE
Israeli B-EVENT
- I-EVENT
Arab I-EVENT
conflict I-EVENT
, O

but O
it O
is O
not O
where O
the O
main O
show O
is O
. O

The O
millions B-ORDINAL
who O
died O
in O
the B-EVENT
Iran I-EVENT
- I-EVENT
Iraq I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Israel B-GPE

The O
mass O
murder O
happening O
right O
now O
in O
Sudan B-GPE
, O
where O
the O
Arab B-NORP
Moslem B-NORP
regime O
is O
massacring O
its O
black O
Christian B-NORP
citizens O
, O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Israel B-GPE
. O

The O
frequent O
reports O
from O
Algeria B-GPE
about O
the O
murders O
of O
hundreds B-ORDINAL
of O
civilians O
in O
one B-ORDINAL
village O
or O
another O
by O
other O
Algerians B-NORP
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Israel B-GPE

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
did O
not O
invade O
Kuwait B-GPE
, O
endanger O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
and O
butcher O
his O

because O
of O
Israel B-GPE

Egypt B-GPE
did O
not O
use O
poison O

against O
Yemen B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
60's I-DATE
because O
of O

of O

in O
one B-DATE

in O
El B-GPE
Hamma I-GPE
in O
Syria B-GPE

of O
Israel B-GPE

The O
Taliban B-ORG
control O
of O
Afghanistan B-GPE
and O
the O
civil O

there O
had O
nothing O

The O

nothing O
to O
do O
with O
Israel B-GPE
, O
and O
I O
could O
go O
on O
and O
on O
and O
on O
. O

The O
root O
of O
the O
trouble O
is O
that O
this O
entire O
Moslem B-NORP
region O
is O
totally O
dysfunctional O
, O
by O
any O
standard O
of O
the O
word O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
so O
even O
if O
Israel B-GPE
had O
joined O
the O
Arab B-NORP
league O
and O
an O
independent O
Palestine B-GPE
had O
existed O
for O
100 B-DATE
years I-DATE

The O
22 B-CARDINAL
member O
countries O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
league O
, O
from O
Mauritania B-GPE
to O
the B-GPE
Gulf I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
have O
a O
total O
population O
of O
300 B-CARDINAL
millions I-CARDINAL
, O
larger O
than O
the O
US B-GPE
and O
almost O
as O
large O
as O
the O
EU B-ORG
before O
its O
expansion O
. O

They O
have O
a O
land O
area O
larger O
than O
either O
the O
US B-GPE
or O
all O
of O
Europe B-LOC
. O

These O
22 B-CARDINAL
countries O
, O
with O
all O
their O
oil O
and O
natural O
resources O
, O
have O
a O
combined O
GDP O
smaller O
than O
that O
of O
Netherlands B-GPE
plus O
Belgium B-GPE
and O
equal O
to O
half O
of O
the O
GDP O
of O
California B-GPE
alone O
. O

Within O
this O
meager O
GDP O
, O
the O
gaps O
between O
rich O
and O
poor O
are O
beyond O
belief O

and O
too O
many O
of O
the O
rich O
made O
their O
money O
not O
by O
succeeding O
in O
business O
, O
but O
by O
being O
corrupt O
rulers O
. O

The O
social O
status O
of O
women O
is O
far O
below O
what O
it O
was O
in O
the B-LOC
Western I-LOC
World I-LOC
150 B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

Human O
rights O
are O
below O
any O
reasonable O
standard O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
grotesque O
fact O
that O
Libya B-GPE
was O
elected O
Chair O
of O
the B-ORG
UN I-ORG
Human I-ORG
Rights I-ORG
commission I-ORG
. O

According O
to O
a O
report O
prepared O
by O
a O
committee O
of O
Arab B-NORP
intellectuals O
and O
published O
under O
the O
auspices O
of O
the O
U.N. B-ORG
, O
the O
number O
of O
books O
translated O
by O
the O
entire O
Arab B-NORP
world O
is O
much O
smaller O
than O
what O
little O
Greece B-GPE
alone O
translates O
. O

The O
total O
number O
of O
scientific O
publications O
of O
300 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
Arabs B-NORP
is O
less O
than O
that O
of O
6 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
Israelis B-NORP
. O

Birth O
rates O
in O
the O
region O
are O
very O
high O
, O
increasing O
the O
poverty O
, O
the O
social O
gaps O
and O
the O
cultural O
decline O
. O

And O
all O
of O
this O
is O
happening O
in O
a O
region O
, O
which O
only O
30 B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
was O
believed O
to O
be O
the O
next O
wealthy O
part O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
in O
a O
Moslem B-NORP
area O
, O
which O
developed O
, O
at O
some O
point O
in O
history O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
advanced O
cultures O
in O
the O
world O
. O

It O
is O
fair O
to O
say O
that O
this O
creates O
an O
unprecedented O
breeding O
ground O
for O
cruel O
dictators O
, O
terror O
networks O
, O
fanaticism O
, O
incitement O
, O
suicide O
murders O
and O
general O
decline O
. O

It O
is O
also O
a O
fact O
that O
almost O
everybody O
in O
the O
region O
blames O
this O
situation O
on O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
on O
Israel B-GPE
, O
on O
Western O
Civilization O
, O
on O
Judaism B-ORG
and O
Christianity B-ORG
, O
on O
anyone O
and O
anything O
, O
except O
themselves O
. O

A O
word O
about O
the O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
decent O
, O
honest O
, O
good O
people O
who O
are O
either O
devout O
Moslems B-NORP
or O
are O
not O
very O
religious O
but O
grew O
up O
in O
Moslem B-NORP
families O
: O

They O
are O
double O
victims O
of O
an O
outside O
world O
, O
which O
now O
develops O
Islamophobia O
, O
and O
of O
their O
own O
environment O
which O
breaks O
their O
heart O
by O
being O
totally O
dysfunctional O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
silent O
majority O
of O
these O
Moslems B-NORP
are O
not O
part O
of O
the O
terror O
and O
the O
incitement O
, O
but O
they O
also O
do O
not O
stand O
up O
political O
leaders O
, O
intellectuals O
, O
business O
people O
and O
many O
others O
. O

Many O
of O
them O
can O
certainly O
tell O
right O
from O
wrong O
, O
but O
are O
afraid O
to O
express O
their O
views O
. O

The O
events O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
have O
amplified O
four B-CARDINAL
issues O
, O
which O
have O
always O
existed O
, O
but O
have O
never O
been O
as O
rampant O
as O
in O
the O
present O
upheaval O
in O
the O
region O
. O

A B-DATE
few I-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
may O
pass O
before O
everybody O
acknowledges O
that O
it O
is O
a B-EVENT
World I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
, O

but O
we O
are O
already O
well O
into O
it O
. O

These O
are O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
main O
pillars O
of O
the O
current O
World O
Conflict O
, O
or O
perhaps O
we O
should O
already O
refer O
to O
it O
as O
`` O
the O
undeclared O
World B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
III I-EVENT
'' O
: O
against O
it O
. O
They O
become O
accomplices O
, O
by O
omission O
, O
and O
this O
applies O
to O

*1 O
. O

Suicide O
murders O
are O
not O
a O
new O
invention O

but O
they O
have O
been O
made O
popular O
, O
if O
I O
may O
use O
this O
expression O
, O
only O
lately O
. O

Even O
after O
September B-EVENT
11 I-EVENT
, O
it O
seems O
that O
most O
of O
the B-LOC
Western I-LOC
World I-LOC
does O
not O
yet O
understand O
this O
weapon O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
potent O
psychological O
weapon O
. O

Its O
real O
direct O
impact O
is O
relatively O
minor O
. O

The O
total O
number O
of O
casualties O
from O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
suicide O
murders O
within O
Israel B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
is O
much O
smaller O
than O
those O
due O
to O
car O
accidents O
. O

September O
11 O
was O
quantitatively O
much O
less O
lethal O
than O
many O
earthquakes O

More O
people O
die O
from O
AIDS O
in O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
in O
Africa B-LOC
than O
all O
the O
Russians B-NORP
who O
died O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
Chechnya B-GPE
- O
based O
Moslem B-NORP
suicide O
murderers O
since O
that O
conflict O
started O
. O

Saddam B-PERSON
killed O
every O
month B-DATE
more O
people O
than O
all O
those O
who O
died O
from O
suicide O
murders O
since O
the O
Coalition B-ORG
occupation O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

So O
what O
is O
all O
the O
fuss O
about O
suicide O
killings O
? O

It O
creates O
headlines O
. O

It O
is O
spectacular O
. O

It O
is O
frightening O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
cruel O
death O
with O
bodies O
dismembered O
and O
horrible O
severe O
lifelong O
injuries O
to O
many O
of O
the O
wounded O
. O

It O
is O
always O
shown O
on O
television O
in O
great O
detail O
. O

One O
such O
murder O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
hysterical O
media O
coverage O
, O
can O
destroy O
the O
tourism O
industry O
of O
a O
country O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
, O
as O
it O
did O
in O
Bali B-GPE
and O
in O
Turkey B-GPE
. O

But O
the O
real O
fear O
comes O
from O
the O
undisputed O
fact O
that O
no O
defense O
and O
no O
preventive O
measures O
can O
succeed O
against O
a O
determined O
suicide O
murderer O
. O

This O
has O
not O
yet O
penetrated O
the O
thinking O
of O
the B-LOC
Western I-LOC
World I-LOC
. O

The O
U.S. B-GPE
and O
Europe B-LOC
are O
constantly O
improving O
their O
defense O
against O
the O
last O
murder O
, O
not O
the O
next O
one O
. O

We O
may O
arrange O
for O
the O
best O
airport O
security O
in O
the O
world O
. O

But O
if O
you O
want O
to O
murder O
by O
suicide O
, O
you O
do O
not O
have O
to O
board O
a O
plane O
in O
order O
to O
explode O
yourself O
and O
kill O
many O
people O
. O

Who O
could O
stop O
a O
suicide O
murder O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
crowded O
line O
waiting O
to O
be O
checked O
by O
the O
airport O
metal O
detector O
? O

How O
about O
the O
lines O
to O
the O
check O
- O
in O
counters O
in O
a O
busy O
travel O
period O
? O

Put O
a O
metal O
detector O
in O
front O
of O
every O
train O
station O
in O
Spain B-GPE
and O
the O
terrorists O
will O
get O
the O
buses O
. O

Protect O
the O
buses O
and O
they O
will O
explode O
in O
movie O
theaters O
, O
concert O
halls O
, O
supermarkets O
, O
shopping O
malls O
, O
schools O
and O
hospitals O
. O

Put O
guards O
in O
front O
of O
every O
concert O
hall O
and O
there O
will O
always O
be O
a O
line O
of O
people O
to O
be O
checked O
by O
the O
guards O

and O
this O
line O
will O
be O
the O
target O
, O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
killing O
the O
guards O
themselves O
. O

You O
can O
somewhat O
reduce O
your O
vulnerability O
by O
preventive O
and O
defensive O
measures O
and O
by O
strict O
border O
controls O
but O
not O
eliminate O
it O
and O
definitely O
not O
win O
the O
war O
in O
a O
defensive O
way O
. O

And O
it O
is O
a O
war O
! O

What O
is O
behind O
the O
suicide O
murders O
? O

Money O
is O
, O
money O
and O
power O
and O
cold O
- O
blooded O
murderous O
incitement O
, O
nothing O
else O
. O

It O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
true O
fanatic O
religious O
beliefs O
. O

No O
Moslem B-NORP
preacher O
has O
ever O
blown O
himself O
up O
. O

No O
son O
of O
an O
Arab B-NORP
politician O
or O
religious O
leader O
has O
ever O
blown O
himself O
up O
. O

No O
relative O
of O
anyone O
influential O
has O
done O
it O
. O

Would O
n't O
you O
expect O
some O
of O
the O
religious O
leaders O
to O
do O
it O
themselves O
, O
or O
to O
talk O
their O
sons O
into O
doing O
it O
, O
if O
this O
is O
truly O
a O
supreme O
act O
of O
religious O
fervor O
? O

Are O
n't O
they O
interested O
in O
the O
benefits O
of O
going O
to O
Heaven O
? O

Instead O
, O
they O
send O
outcast O
women O
, O
naive O
children O
, O
retarded O
people O
and O
young O
incited O
hotheads O
. O

They O
promise O
them O
the O
delights O
, O
mostly O
sexual O
, O
of O
the O
next O
world O
, O
and O
pay O
their O
families O
handsomely O
after O
the O
supreme O
act O
is O
performed O
and O
enough O
innocent O
people O
are O
dead O
. O

Suicide O
murders O
also O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
poverty O
and O
despair O
. O

The O
poorest O
region O
in O
the O
world O
, O
by O
far O
, O
is O
Africa B-ORG
. O

It O
never O
happens O
there O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
desperate O
people O
in O
the O
world O
, O
in O
different O
cultures O
, O
countries O
and O
continents O
. O

Desperation O
does O
not O
provide O
anyone O
with O
explosives O
, O
reconnaissance O
and O
transportation O
. O

There O
was O
certainly O
more O
despair O
in O
Saddam B-PERSON

Iraq B-GPE
than O
in O
Paul B-PERSON
Bremmer I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
Iraq B-GPE
, O

and O
no O
one O
exploded O
himself O

A O
suicide O
murder O
is O
simply O
a O
horrible O
, O
vicious O
weapon O
of O
cruel O
, O
inhuman O
, O
cynical O
, O
well O

terrorists O

with O
no O
regard O
to O
human O
life O

including O
the O

but O
with O
very O
high O
regard O
to O
their O

The O
only O
way O
to O
fight O
this O
new O
`` O
popular O
'' O
weapon O
is O
identical O
to O
the O
only O
way O
in O
which O
you O
fight O
organized O
crime O
or O
pirates O
on O
the O
high O
seas O
: O
the O
offensive O
way O
. O

Like O
in O
the O
case O
of O
organized O
crime O
, O
it O
is O
crucial O
that O
the O
forces O
on O
the O
offensive O
be O
united O
and O
it O
is O
crucial O
to O
reach O
the O
top O
of O
the O
crime O
pyramid O
. O

You O
can O
not O
eliminate O
organized O
crime O
by O
arresting O
the O
little O
drug O
dealer O
on O
the O
street O
corner O
. O

You O
must O
go O
after O
the O
head O
of O
the O
`` O
Family O
'' O
. O

If O
part O
of O
the O
public O
supports O
it O
, O
others O
tolerate O
it O
, O
many O
are O
afraid O
of O
it O
and O
some O
try O
to O
explain O
it O
away O
by O
poverty O
or O
by O
a O
miserable O
childhood O
, O
organized O
crime O
will O
thrive O
and O
so O
will O
terrorism O

The B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
understands O
this O
now O
, O
after O
September B-EVENT
11 I-EVENT
. O

Russia B-GPE
is O
beginning O
to O
understand O
it O
. O

Turkey B-GPE
understands O
it O
well O
. O

I O
am O
very O
much O
afraid O
that O
most O
of O
Europe B-LOC
still O
does O
not O
understand O
it O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
Europe B-LOC
will O
understand O
it O
only O
after O
suicide O
murders O
arrive O
in O
Europe B-LOC
in O
a O
big O
way O
. O

In O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
this O
will O
definitely O
happen O
. O

The O
Spanish B-NORP
trains O
and O
the O
Istanbul B-GPE
bombings O
are O
only O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O
unity O
of O
the O
Civilized O
World O
in O
fighting O
this O
horror O
is O
absolutely O
indispensable O
. O

Until O
Europe B-LOC
wakes O
up O
, O
this O
unity O
will O
not O
be O
achieved O

It O
is O
often O
said O
that O
politicians O
, O
diplomats O
and O
perhaps O
also O
lawyers O
and O
business O
people O
must O
sometimes O
lie O
, O
as O
part O
of O
their O
professional O
life O
. O

But O
the O
norms O
of O
politics O
and O
diplomacy O
are O
childish O
, O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
level O
of O
incitement O
and O
total O
absolute O
deliberate O
fabrications O
, O
which O
have O
reached O
new O
heights O
in O
the O
region O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
. O

An O
incredible O
number O
of O
people O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP
world O
believe O
that O
September B-EVENT
11 I-EVENT
never O
happened O
, O
or O
was O
an O
American B-NORP
provocation O
or O
, O
even O
better O
, O
a O
Jewish B-NORP
plot O
. O

You O
all O
remember O
the O
Iraqi O
Minister O
of O
Information O
, O
Mr. O
Mouhamad B-PERSON
Said I-PERSON
al-Sahaf I-PERSON
and O
his O
press O
conferences O
when O
the O
US B-NORP
forces O
were O
already O
inside O
Baghdad B-GPE
. O

Disinformation O
at O
time O
of O
war O
is O
an O
accepted O
tactic O
. O

But O
to O
stand O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
and O
to O
make O
such O
preposterous O
statements O
, O
known O
to O
everybody O
to O
be O
lies O
, O
without O
even O
being O
ridiculed O
in O
your O
own O
milieu O
, O
can O
only O
happen O
in O
this O
region O
. O

Mr. O
Sahaf B-PERSON
eventually O
became O
a O
popular O
icon O
as O
a O
court O
jester O
, O

but O
this O
did O
not O
stop O
some O
allegedly O
respectable O
newspapers O
from O
giving O
him O
equal O
time O
. O

It O
also O
does O
not O
prevent O
the O
Western O
press O
from O
giving O
credence O
, O
every O
day O
, O
even O
now O
, O
to O
similar O
liars O
. O

After O
all O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
an O
anti-Semite O
, O
there O
are O
subtle O
ways O
of O
doing O
it O
. O

You O
do O
not O
have O
to O
claim O
that O
the O
holocaust B-EVENT
never O
happened O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
temple O
in O
Jerusalem B-GPE
never O
existed O
. O

But O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
Moslems B-NORP
are O
told O
by O
their O
leaders O
that O
this O
is O
the O
case O
. O

When O
these O
same O
leaders O
make O
other O
statements O
, O
the O
Western O
media O
report O
them O
as O
if O
they O
could O
be O
true O
. O

It O
is O
a O
daily O
occurrence O
that O
the O
same O
people O
who O
finance O
, O
arm O
and O
dispatch O
suicide O
murderers O
, O
condemn O
the O
act O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE
in O
front O
of O
western O
TV O
cameras O
, O
talking O
to O
a O
world O
audience O
, O
which O
even O
partly O
believes O
them O
. O

It O
is O
a O
daily O
routine O
to O
hear O
the O
same O
leader O
making O
opposite O
statements O
in O
Arabic B-LANGUAGE
to O
his O
people O
and O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE
to O
the O

Incitement O
by O
Arab B-NORP
TV O
, O
accompanied O
by O
horror O
pictures O
of O
mutilated O
bodies O
, O
has O
become O
a O
powerful O
weapon O
of O
those O
who O
lie O
, O
distort O
and O
want O
to O
destroy O
everything O
. O

Little O
children O
are O
raised O
on O
deep O
hatred O
and O
on O
admiration O
of O
so O
- O
called O
martyrs O
, O

and O
the O
Western O
World O
does O
not O
notice O
it O
because O
its O
own O
TV O
sets O
are O
mostly O
tuned O
to O
soap O
operas O
and O
game O
shows O
. O

I O
recommend O
to O
you O
, O
even O
though O
most O
of O
you O
do O
not O
understand O
Arabic B-LANGUAGE
, O
to O
watch O
Al B-ORG

from O
time O
to O

. O

You O
will O
not O
believe O
your O
own O

But O
words O
also O
work O
in O
other O
ways O

more O
subtle O

A O

featuring O
three B-DATE

is O
defined O
by O

by O

as O
a O

You O
may O

a O

A O
woman O
walks O
into O
an O
Israeli B-NORP
restaurant O
in O
mid-day O
, O
eats O
, O
observes O
families O
with O
old O
people O
and O
children O
eating O
their O
lunch O
in O
the O
adjacent O
tables O
and O
pays O
the O
bill O

She O
then O
blows O
herself O
up O
, O
killing O
20 B-CARDINAL
people O
, O
including O
many O
children O
, O
with O
heads O
and O
arms O
rolling O
around O
in O
the O
restaurant O

She O
is O
called O
`` O
martyr O
'' O
by O
several O
Arab B-NORP
leaders O
and O
`` O
activist O
'' O
by O
the O
European B-NORP

Dignitaries O
condemn O
the O
act O
but O
visit O
her O
bereaved O
family O
and O
the O
money O
flows O
. O

There O
is O
a O
new O
game O
in O
town O
: O

The O
actual O
murderer O
is O
called O
`` O
the O
military O
wing O
'' O
, O

the O
one O
who O
pays O
him O
, O
equips O
him O
and O
sends O
him O
is O
now O
called O
`` O
the O
political O
wing O
'' O

and O
the O
head O
of O
the O
operation O
is O
called O
the O
`` O
spiritual O
leader O
'' O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
other O
examples O
of O
such O
Orwellian O
nomenclature O
, O
used O
every O
day O
not O
only O
by O
terror O
chiefs O
but O
also O
by O
Western O
media O
. O

These O
words O
are O
much O
more O
dangerous O
than O
many O
people O
realize O
. O

They O
provide O
an O
emotional O
infrastructure O
for O
atrocities O
. O

It O
was O
Joseph B-PERSON
Goebbels I-PERSON
who O
said O
that O
if O
you O
repeat O
a O
lie O
often O
enough O
, O
people O
will O
believe O
it O

He O
is O

Huge O
amounts O
of O
money O
, O
which O
could O
have O
solved O
many O
social O
problems O
in O
this O
dysfunctional O
part O
of O
the O
world O
, O
are O
channeled O
into O
three B-CARDINAL
concentric O
spheres O
supporting O
death O
and O
murder O
. O

In O
the O
inner O
circle O
are O
the O
terrorists O
themselves O
. O

The O
money O
funds O
their O
travel O
, O
explosives O
, O
hideouts O
and O
permanent O
search O
for O
soft O
vulnerable O
targets O
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
are O
primarily O
financed O
by O
terrorist O
states O
like O
Iran B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
, O
until O
recently O
also O
by O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
Libya B-GPE
and O
earlier O
also O
by O
some O
of O
the O
Communist B-NORP
regimes O
. O

These O
states O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
, O
are O
the O
safe O
havens O
of O
the O
wholesale O
murder O
vendors O
. O

They O
are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
wider O
circle O
of O
direct O
supporters O
, O
planners O
, O
commanders O
, O
preachers O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
make O
a O
living O
, O
usually O
a O
very O
comfortable O
living O
, O
by O
serving O
as O
terror O
infrastructure O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
find O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
circle O
of O
so O
- O
called O
religious O
, O
educational O
and O
welfare O
organizations O
, O
which O
actually O
do O
some O
good O
, O
feed O
the O
hungry O
and O
provide O
some O
schooling O
, O
but O
brainwash O
a O
new O
generation O
with O
hatred O
, O
lies O
and O
ignorance O
. O

This O
circle O
operates O
mostly O
through O
mosques O
, O
madrasas O
and O
other O
religious O
establishments O
but O
also O
through O
inciting O
electronic O
and O
printed O
media O
. O

It O
is O
this O
circle O
that O
makes O
sure O
that O
women O
remain O
inferior O
, O
that O
democracy O
is O
unthinkable O
and O
that O
exposure O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
is O
minimal O
. O

It O
is O
also O
that O
circle O
that O
leads O
the O
way O
in O
blaming O
everybody O
outside O
the O
Moslem B-NORP
world O
, O
for O
the O
miseries O
of O
the O
region O
. O

The O
outer O
circle O
is O
largely O
financed O
by O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
, O
but O
also O
by O
donations O
from O
certain O
Moslem B-NORP
communities O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
Europe B-LOC
and O
, O
to O
a O
smaller O
extent O
, O
by O
donations O
of O
European B-NORP
Governments O
to O
various O
NGO's O
and O
by O
certain O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
organizations O
, O
whose O
goals O
may O
be O
noble O
, O
but O
they O
are O
infested O
and O
exploited O
by O
agents O
of O
the O
outer O
circle O
. O

The O
Saudi B-NORP
regime O
, O
of O
course O
, O
will O
be O
the O
next O
victim O
of O
major O
terror O
, O
when O
the O
inner O
circle O
will O
explode O
into O
the O
outer O
circle O
. O

The O
Saudis B-NORP
are O
beginning O
to O
understand O
it O
, O
but O
they O
fight O
the O
inner O
circles O
, O
while O
still O
financing O
the O
infrastructure O
at O
the O
outer O
circle O
. O

Figuratively O
speaking O
, O
this O
outer O
circle O
is O
the O
guardian O
, O
which O
makes O
sure O
that O
the O
people O
look O
and O
listen O
inwards O
to O
the O
inner O
circle O
of O
terror O
and O
incitement O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
the O
world O
outside O
. O

Some O
parts O
of O
this O
same O
outer O
circle O
actually O
operate O
as O
a O
result O
of O
fear O
from O
, O
or O
blackmail O
by O
, O
the O
inner O
circles O
. O

The O
horrifying O
added O
factor O
is O
the O
high O
birth O
rate O
. O

Half B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
population O
of O
the O

the O
most O
receptive O

to O
face O
the O
dilemma O
. O

But O
it O
can O
not O
be O
avoided O
. O

Suppose O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
discussion O
, O
that O
someone O
would O
openly O
stay O
in O
a O
well O
- O
known O
address O
in O
Teheran B-GPE
, O
hosted O
by O
the O
Iranian B-NORP
Government O
and O
financed O
by O
it O
, O
executing O
one O
atrocity O
after O
another O
in O
Spain B-GPE
or O
in O
France B-GPE
, O
killing O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
innocent O
people O
, O
accepting O
responsibility O
for O
the O
crimes O
, O
promising O
in O
public O
TV O
interviews O
to O
do O
more O
of O
the O
same O
, O
while O
the B-ORG
Government I-ORG
of I-ORG
Iran I-ORG
issues O
public O
condemnations O
of O
his O
acts O
but O
continues O
to O
host O
him O
, O
invite O
him O
to O
official O
functions O
and O
treat O
him O
as O
a O
great O
dignitary O
. O

I O
leave O
it O
to O
you O
as O
homework O
to O
figur O
out O
what O
Spain B-GPE
or O
France B-GPE
would O
have O
done O
, O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
civilized O
world O
is O
still O
having O
illusions O
about O
the O
rule O
of O
law O
in O
a O
totally O
lawless O
environment O
. O

It O
is O
trying O
to O
play O
ice O
hockey O
by O
sending O
a O
ballerina O
ice O
- O
skater O
into O
the O
ring O
or O
to O
knock O
out O
a O
heavyweight O
boxer O
by O
a O
chess O
player O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
that O
no O
country O
has O
a O
law O
against O
cannibals O
eating O
its O
prime O
minister O
, O
because O
such O
an O
act O
is O
unthinkable O
, O
international O
law O
does O
not O
address O
killers O
shooting O
from O
hospitals O
, O
mosques O
and O
ambulances O
, O
while O
being O
protected O
by O
their O
Government O
or O
society O
. O

International O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
handle O
someone O
who O
sends O
children O
to O
throw O
stones O
, O
stands O
behind O
them O
and O
shoots O
with O
immunity O
and O
can O
not O
be O
arrested O
because O
he O
is O
sheltered O
by O
a O
Government O
. O

International O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
leader O
of O
murderers O
who O
is O
royally O
and O
comfortably O
hosted O
by O
a O
country O
, O
which O
pretends O
to O
condemn O
his O
acts O
or O
just O
claims O
to O
be O
too O
weak O
to O
arrest O
him O
. O

The O
amazing O
thing O
is O
that O
all O
of O
these O
crooks O
demand O
protection O
under O
international O
law O
, O
and O
define O
all O
those O
who O
attack O
them O
as O
`` O
war O
criminals O
, O
'' O
with O
some O
Western O
media O
repeating O
the O
allegations O
. O

The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
all O
of O
this O
is O
temporary O
, O

because O
the O
evolution O
of O
international O
law O
has O
always O
adapted O
itself O
to O
reality O
. O

The O
punishment O
for O
suicide O
murder O
should O
be O
death O
or O
arrest O
before O
the O
murder O
, O
not O
during O
and O
not O
after O
. O

After O
every O
world O
war O
, O
the O
rules O
of O
international O
law O
have O
changed O
, O
and O
the O
same O
will O
happen O
after O
the O
present O
one O
. O

But O
during O
the O
twilight O
zone O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
harm O
can O
be O
done O
. O

The O
picture O
I O
described O
here O
is O
not O
pretty O
. O

What O
can O
we O
do O
about O
it O
? O

In O
the O
short O
run O
, O
only O
fight O
and O
win O
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
only O
educate O
the O
next O
generation O
and O
open O
it O
to O
the O
world O
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
can O
and O
must O
be O
destroyed O
by O
force O
. O

The O
outer O
circle O
can O
not O
be O
eliminated O
by O
force O
. O

Here O
we O
need O
financial O
starvation O
of O
the O
organizing O
elite O
, O
more O
power O
to O
women O
, O
more O
education O
, O
counter-propaganda O
, O
boycott O
whenever O
feasible O
and O
access O
to O
Western O
media O
, O
internet O
and O
the O
international O
scene O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
we O
need O
a O
total O
absolute O
unity O
and O
determination O
of O
the O
civilized O
world O
against O
all O
three B-CARDINAL
circles O
of O
evil O
. O

Allow O
me O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
to O
depart O
from O
my O
alleged O
role O
as O
a O
taxi O
driver O
and O
return O
to O
science O
. O

When O
you O
have O
a O
malignant O
tumor O
, O
you O
may O
remove O
the O
tumor O
itself O
surgically O
. O

You O
may O
also O
starve O
it O
by O
preventing O
new O
blood O
from O
reaching O
it O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
, O
thereby O
preventing O
new O
`` O
supplies O
'' O
from O
expanding O
the O
tumor O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
is O
best O
to O
do O
both O
. O

But O
before O
you O
fight O
and O
win O
, O
by O
force O
or O
otherwise O
, O
you O
have O
to O
realize O
that O
you O
are O
in O
a O
war O
, O
and O
this O
may O
take O
Europe B-LOC
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

In O
order O
to O
win O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
first B-ORDINAL
eliminate O
the O
terrorist O
regimes O
, O
so O
that O
no O
Government O
in O
the O
world O
will O
serve O
as O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
these O
people O
. O

I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
comment O
here O
on O
whether O
the O
American B-NORP
- O
led O
attack O
on O
Iraq B-GPE
was O
justified O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
or O
any O
other O
pre-war O
argument O
, O
but O
I O
can O
look O
at O
the O
post-war O
map O
of O
Western B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
. O

Now O
that O
Afghanistan B-GPE
, O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
Libya B-GPE
are O
out O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
terrorist O
states O
remain O
: O
Iran B-GPE
, O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
the O
latter O
being O
a O
Syrian B-NORP
colony O
. O

Perhaps O
Sudan B-GPE
should O
be O
added O
to O
the O
list O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
conquest O
of O
Afghanistan B-GPE
and O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
both O
Iran B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
are O
now O
totally O
surrounded O
by O
territories O
unfriendly O
to O
them O
. O

Iran B-GPE
is O
encircled O
by O
Afghanistan B-GPE
, O
by O
the B-GPE
Gulf I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
the O
Moslem B-NORP
republics O
of O
the O
former O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
. O

Syria B-GPE
is O
surrounded O
by O
Turkey B-GPE
, O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
Jordan B-GPE
and O
Israel B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
a O
significant O
strategic O
change O
and O
it O
applies O
strong O
pressure O
on O
the O
terrorist O
countries O
. O

It O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
Iran B-GPE
is O
so O
active O
in O
trying O
to O
incite O
a O
Shiite B-NORP
uprising O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
American B-NORP
plan O
was O
actually O
to O
encircle O
both O
Iran B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
resulting O
situation O
. O

In O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
the O
number O
one B-CARDINAL
danger O
to O
the O
world O
today O
is O
Iran B-GPE
and O
its O
regime O
. O

It O
definitely O
has O
ambitions O
to O
rule O
vast O
areas O
and O
to O
expand O
in O
all O
directions O
. O

It O
has O
an O
ideology O
which O
claims O
supremacy O
over O
Western O
culture O
. O

It O
is O
ruthless O
. O

It O
has O
proven O
that O
it O
can O
execute O
elaborate O
terrorist O
acts O
without O
leaving O
too O
many O
traces O
, O
using O
Iranian B-NORP
Embassies O
. O

It O
is O
clearly O
trying O
to O
develop O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

Its O
so O
- O
called O
moderates O
and O
conservatives O
play O
their O
own O
virtuoso O
version O
of O
the O
`` O
good O
- O
cop O
versus O
bad O
- O
cop O
'' O
game O
. O

Iran B-GPE
sponsors O
Syrian B-NORP
terrorism O
, O

it O
is O
certainly O
behind O
much O
of O
the O
action O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
, O

it O
is O
fully O
funding O
the O
Hezbollah B-ORG
and O
, O
through O
it O
, O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
Hamas B-ORG
and O
Islamic B-ORG
Jihad I-ORG
; O

it O
performed O
acts O
of O
terror O
at O
least O
in O
Europe B-LOC
and O
in O
South B-LOC
America I-LOC
and O
probably O
also O
in O
Uzbekistan B-GPE
and O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE

and O
it O
truly O
leads O
a O
multi-national O
terror O
consortium O
, O
which O
includes O
, O
as O
minor O
players O
, O
Syria B-GPE
, O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
certain O
Shiite B-NORP
elements O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
most O
European B-NORP
countries O
still O
trade O
with O
Iran B-GPE
, O
try O
to O
appease O
it O
and O
refuse O
to O
read O
the O
clear O
signals O
. O

In O
order O
to O
win O
the O
war O
it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
dry O
the O
financial O
resources O
of O
the O
terror O
conglomerate O
. O

It O
is O
pointless O
to O
try O
to O
understand O
the O
subtle O
differences O
between O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
terror O
of O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
and O
Hamas B-ORG
and O
the O
Shiite B-NORP
terror O
of O
Hezbollah B-ORG
, O
Sadr B-ORG
and O
other O
Iranian B-NORP
- O
inspired O
enterprises O
. O

When O
it O
serves O
their O
business O
needs O
, O
all O
of O
them O
collaborate O
beautifully O
. O

It O
is O
crucial O
to O
stop O
Saudi B-NORP
and O
other O
financial O
support O
of O
the O
outer O
circle O
, O
which O
is O
the O
fertile O
breeding O
ground O
of O
terror O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
monitor O
all O
donations O
from O
the O
Western O
World O
to O
Islamic B-NORP
organizations O
, O
to O
monitor O
the O
finances O
of O
international O
relief O
organizations O
and O
to O
react O
with O
forceful O
economic O
measures O
to O
any O
small O
sign O
of O
financial O
aid O
to O
any O
of O
the O
three O
circles O
of O
terrorism O
. O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
act O
decisively O
against O
the O
campaign O
of O
lies O
and O
fabrications O
and O
to O
monitor O
those O
Western O
media O
who O
collaborate O
with O
it O
out O
of O
naivety O
, O
financial O
interests O
or O
ignorance O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
never O
surrender O
to O
terror O
. O

No O
one O
will O
ever O
know O
whether O
the O
recent O
elections O
in O
Spain B-GPE
would O
have O
yielded O
a O
different O
result O
, O
if O
not O
for O
the O
train O
bombings O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
earlier I-DATE
. O

But O
it O
really O
does O
not O
matter O
. O

What O
matters O
is O
that O
the O
terrorists O
believe O
that O
they O
caused O
the O
result O
and O
that O
they O
won O
by O
driving O
Spain B-GPE
out O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

The O
Spanish B-NORP
story O
will O
surely O
end O
up O
being O
extremely O
costly O
to O
other O
European B-NORP
countries O
, O
including O
France B-GPE
, O
who O
is O
now O
expelling O
inciting O
preachers O
and O
forbidding O
veils O
and O
including O
others O
who O
sent O
troops O
to O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
Spain B-GPE
itself O
will O
pay O
even O
more O
. O

Is O
the O
solution O
a O
democratic O
Arab B-NORP
world O
? O

If O
by O
democracy O
we O
mean O
free O
elections O
but O
also O
free O
press O
, O
free O
speech O
, O
a O
functioning O
judicial O
system O
, O
civil O
liberties O
, O
equality O
to O
women O
, O
free O
international O
travel O
, O
exposure O
to O
international O
media O
and O
ideas O
, O
laws O
against O
racial O
incitement O
and O
against O
defamation O
, O
and O
avoidance O
of O
lawless O
behavior O
regarding O
hospitals O
, O
places O
of O
worship O
and O
children O
, O
then O
yes O
, O
democracy O
is O
the O
solution O
. O

If O
democracy O
is O
just O
free O
elections O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
most O
fanatic O
regime O
will O
be O
elected O
, O
the O
one O
whose O
incitement O
and O
fabrications O
are O
the O
most O
inflammatory O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
it O
already O
in O
Algeria B-GPE
and O
, O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
, O
in O
Turkey B-GPE
. O

It O
will O
happen O
again O
, O
if O
the O
ground O
is O
not O
prepared O
very O
carefully O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
a O
certain O
transition O
democracy O
, O
as O
in O
Jordan B-GPE
, O
may O
be O
a O
better O
temporary O
solution O
, O
paving O
the O
way O
for O
the O
real O
thing O
, O
perhaps O
in O
the O
same O
way O
that O
an O
immediate O
sudden O
democracy O
did O
not O
work O
in O
Russia B-GPE
and O
would O
not O
have O
worked O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
civilized O
world O
will O
prevail O
. O

But O
the O
longer O
it O
takes O
us O
to O
understand O
the O
new O
landscape O
of O
this O
war O
, O
the O
more O
costly O
and O
painful O
the O
victory O
will O
be O

Its O

that O

These O

flocked O

That O

Instead O

of O
the O

indexers O
can O
design O
a O

TILT O
FUNDS O
: O

This O

an O

Instead O
of O
replicating O
the O

some O

exactly O
, O
some O
stocks O
are O
overweighted O

underweighted O
in O

One B-CARDINAL
simple O
approach O
is O
to O
exclude O
S-AMP-P O
500 O
companies O
considered O
bankruptcy O

; O
this O
can O
avoid O
weak O

but O
also O
can O
hurt O
when O
a O

. O

Another O
approach O
: O
An O
investor O
with O
$ B-MONEY
100 I-MONEY

might O
use O
$ B-MONEY
75 I-MONEY

We O

always O
thought O
that O

but O
maybe O
the O
state O

factions O
are O
starting O
to O
overwhelm O
the O
forces O
that O
made O
it O
such O
a O
significant O
place O

What O
else O
is O
one O
to O
make O
of O
the O
whacky O
save O
- O
the O
- O
earth O
initiative O
just O
proposed O
by O
several O
major O
environmental O
groups O
and O
organized O
by O
the O
state O
's O
attorney O
general O
? O

If O
passed O
by O
the O
voters O
, O
the O
recently O
announced O
initiative O
would O
phase O
out O
major O
pesticides O
, O
reduce O
carbon O

emissions O
by O
40 B-PERCENT

, O
ban O

thought O

armed O
with O
a O
$ B-MONEY
40 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
budget O
to O
sue O
any O
firm O
or O
agency O
he O
thinks O
is O
being O
too O
dirty O
. O

The O
initiative O
is O
based O
largely O
on O
the O
wish O
- O
lists O
of O
the O
green O
lobby O
: O
the B-ORG
Sierra I-ORG

Interestingly O
, O
the B-ORG
Environmental I-ORG
Defense I-ORG

is O
having O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
this O
one O
. O

Not O
only O
Californians B-NORP
but O
all O
Americans B-NORP
would O
pay O
if O
this O
thing O
passed O
. O

The O
initiative O
bars O
the O
sale O
of O
any O
crops O
in O
California B-GPE
that O
do O
n't O
meet O
the O
initiative O
's O
standards O
. O

Kansas B-GPE
wheat O
farmers O
and O
Florida B-GPE
fruit O
growers O
would O
have O
to O
adjust O
or O
give O
up O
the O
California B-GPE
market O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
California B-GPE
is O
presuming O
to O
take O
control O
of O
the O
nation O
's O
farm O
policy O
. O

As O
usual O
the O
green O
lobby O
's O
proposal O
is O
disconnected O
from O
scientific O
reality O
. O

Consider O
the O
greenhouse O
- O
effect O
provision O
. O

The O
proposed O
initiative O
would O
mandate O
a O
reduction O
of O
carbon O
dioxide O
of O
40 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

Even O
if O
one O
buys O
into O
the O
whole O
greenhouse O
theory O
, O
it O
is O
inconceivable O
that O
reductions O
in O
a O
single O
state O
could O
have O
any O
impact O
on O
what O
is O
billed O
as O
a O
global O
problem O
. O

But O
if O
rational O
science O
and O
economics O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
the O
new O
environment O
initiative O
, O
what O
is O
going O
on O
? O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
to O
look O
under O
these O
circumstances O
is O
at O
the O
ways O
in O
which O
the O
sponsors O
themselves O
will O
benefit O
. O

The O
key O
here O
is O
the O
ambition O
of O
state O
Attorney O
General O
John B-PERSON
Van I-PERSON

Kamp I-PERSON
. O

He O
's O
running O

Mr. O
Van B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Kamp I-PERSON
is O
the O
one O
who O
collected O
the O
plans O
from O
the O
various O
radical O
environmental O
groups O
and O
cobbled O
them O
into O
a O
single O
unwieldy O
initiative O
to O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
ballot O
for O
election O
on O
Nov. B-DATE
6 I-DATE
, I-DATE
1990 I-DATE
. O

That O
's O
also O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
of O
the O
gubernatorial O
election O
. O

The O
initiative O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
crafted O
to O
include O
all O
the O
hot O
issues O
that O
set O
off O
the O
wealthy O
Hollywood B-GPE
weepers O
who O
donate O
money O
. O

And O
it O
allows O
Mr. O
Van B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Kamp I-PERSON
to O
get O
around O
campaign O
spending O
limits O
. O

He O
can O
spend O
the O
legal O
maximum O
for O
his O
campaign O
; O
all O
the O
spending O
for O
the O
Van B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Kamp I-PERSON
initiative O
-LRB- O
on O
which O
there O
are O
no O
limits O
-RRB- O
is O
gravy O
. O

This O
initiative O
is O
being O
labeled O
The O
Big O
Green O
, O
but O
maybe O
it O
should O
be O
called O
The O
Big O
Greenback O
. O

-LRB- O
The O
Republican B-NORP
candidate O
, O
Sen. O
Pete B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON

is O
playing O
the O

game O
too O
, O
sponsoring O
his O
own O

initiative O
. O
-RRB- O

While O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
the O
Big O
Green O
initiative O
will O
be O
ruled O
unconstitutional O
, O
it O
is O
of O
course O
conceivable O
that O
in O
modern O
California B-GPE
it O
could O
slide O
through O
. O

This O
is O
the O
state O
that O
recently O
passed O
the O
Prop. O
65 O
anti-toxic O
initiative O
. O

If O
this O
new O
proposal O
ever O
does O
become O
law O
, O
the O
green O
lobby O
will O
benefit O
directly O
. O

The O
initiative O
creates O
a O
free O
floating O
state O
environmental O
officer O
to O
sue O
companies O
or O
government O
agencies O
that O
do O
things O
he O
does O
n't O
like O
. O

That O
means O
the O
NRDC B-ORG
and O
such O
groups O
no O
longer O
would O
have O
to O
spend O
as O
much O
money O
on O
litigation O
; O
taxpayers O
would O
bear O
the O
cost O
. O

Mr. O
Van B-PERSON
de I-PERSON
Kamp I-PERSON
and O
his O
allies O
may O
be O
hoping O
that O
the O
environment O
is O
such O
a O
mom O
and O
apple O
- O
pie O
issue O
among O
certain O
segments O
of O
California B-GPE

population O
now O
that O
almost O
any O
collection O
of O
anti-scientific O
, O
anti-pocketbook O
nonsense O
can O
pass O
under O
its O
rubric O
. O

Of O
course O
the O
state O
's O
liberals O
are O
not O
yet O
a O
nation O
unto O
themselves O
. O

George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
, O
for O
example O
, O
may O
decide O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
the O
President O
who O
lost O
control O
of O
interstate O
commerce O
to O
an O
attorney O
general O
from O
California B-GPE
. O

And O
some O
other O
segments O
of O
California B-GPE
's O
political O
and O
media O
culture O
may O
yet O
start O
to O
point O
out O
that O
the O
initiative O
would O
impose O
significant O
costs O
on O
the O
state O

less O
affluent O
citizens O
in O
the O
form O
of O
higher O
food O

This O
grandiose O
initiative O
will O
help O
California B-GPE
define O
itself O
for O
the O
future O
either O
as O
a O
state O
still O

Cuban B-NORP

setting O
up O
a O

welcome O
the B-DATE

one B-DATE

late O
for O
much O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Many O
experts O
contend O
most O
of O
the O
world O
was O
at O
least O
technically O
wrong O
by O
bringing O
in O
the B-DATE
new I-DATE
millennium I-DATE
with O
massive O
celebrations O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

These O
experts O
point O
out O
that O
the O
Gregorian O
calendar O
started O
in O
1 B-DATE
AD I-DATE
and O
therefore O
, O
centuries O
' O
millennia O
start O
with O
a O
one B-CARDINAL

not O
a O

They O
say O
this O
makes O
2001 B-DATE
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
year I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
third I-DATE
millennium I-DATE
. O

For O
those O
observing O
the B-DATE
start I-DATE
of I-DATE
2001 I-DATE
as O
a O
true O
dawn O
of O
the B-DATE
twenty I-DATE
- I-DATE
first I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
the O
parties O
and O

are O
fewer O

less O
elaborate O
than O
the O
2000 B-DATE
celebrations O
. O

In O
Cuba B-GPE
though O
, O
where O
President O
Castro B-PERSON
had O
his O
country O
sit O
out O
last B-DATE

Today B-DATE
since O
we O
came O
we O
've O
been O
talking O
about O
this O
phrase O
domestic O
brand O
, O
ah O
, O
but O
what O
exactly O
does O
it O
mean O
. O

Because O
we O
also O
know O
that O
actually O
the O
engines O
in O
some O
models O
of O
Chery B-ORG
are O
not O
made O
by O
the O
company O
itself O
, O
so O
how O
do O
we O
explain O
domestic O
brand O
. O

Domestic O
brand O
, O
eh O
, O
actually O
is O
just O
what O
the O
name O
implies O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
, O
it O
's O
our O
own O
baby O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
the O
baby O
son O
is O
not O
adopted O
, O
but O
our O
very O
own O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
your O
own O
baby O
's O
arms O
and O
legs O
can O
be O
bought O
from O
other O
people O
and O
put O
on O
. O

So O
, O
so O
, O
eh O
, O
among O
these O
kinds O
of O
domestic O
brands O
, O
there O
is O
still O
some O
distance O
between O
the O
complete O
brand O
and O
the O
product O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
the O
brand O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
incorporates O
the O
product O
, O
ah O
, O
incorporates O
the O
company O
, O
ah O
, O
incorporates O
a O
lot O
of O
content O
, O
and O
includes O
its O
denotation O
and O
its O
connotation O
, O
many O
emotional O
things O
, O
while O
the O
product O
itself O
, O
eh O
, O
is O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
brand O
, O
ah O
. O

Yeah O
. O

So O
, O
how O
should O
we O
view O
this O
part O
of O
the O
product O
. O

We O
think O
that O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
is O
exactly O
, O
eh O
, O
in O
the O
process O
of O
independent O
innovation O
, O
then O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
completely O
cut O
ourselves O
off O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

Because O
, O
for O
example O
, O
at O
present O
, O
we O
of O
are O
still O
using O
, O
using O
some O
chips O
from O
abroad O
as O
some O
of O
our O
chips O
in O
computers O
. O

So O
this O
entire O
process O
is O
a O
process O
of O
how O
to O
transform O
the O
main O
parts O
and O
the O
core O
parts O
by O
phases O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
we O
must O
have O
our O
own O
brands O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
we O
must O
have O
the O
main O
part O
of O
our O
own O
product O
. O

Then O
we O
must O
gradually O
, O
step O
by O
step O
perfect O
the O
core O
part O
, O
eh O
, O
through O
, O
step O
by O
step O
, O
importation O
, O
digesting O
and O
absorbing O

Yeah O

, O
welcome O

The O

ah O
Aharon B-PERSON

in O

Justice I-FAC
yesterday O
that O
the O

has O
the O
right O
to O
carry O
out O
assassinations O
and O
this O
is O
not O
against O
the O

. O

Please O
. O

Me O
or O
you O
, O
it O
is O
good O
that O
you O
started O
with O
this O
question O
because O
in O
my O
opinion O
it O
is O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
that O
appeared O
in O
the O
newspaper O
in O
the O
headlines O
in O
the O
Hebrew B-LANGUAGE
press O
today O
. O

Aha O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
this O
ah O
ah O
represents O
an O
underlying O
bias O
in O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
judiciary O
as O
a O
whole O
for O
the O
logic O
of O
rule O
of O

. O

Aha O
. O

Ah O
legitimizing O
killings O
outside O
of O
the O
law O
and O
without O
, O
huh O
, O
any O
legal O
basis O
, O
ah O
it O
ah O
reveals O
ah O
what O
what O
is O
known O
to O
everyone O
that O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
judicial O
establishment O
with O
its O
highest O
authority O
is O
part O
of O
the O
ruling O
Israeli B-NORP
establishment O
, O
part O
of O
the O
occupation O
, O
part O
of O
the O
suppression O
process O
the O
occupation O
country O
is O
practicing O
against O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
. O

Ah O
previously O
, O
the O
legal O
system O
would O
ignore O
incidents O
of O
lawbreaking O
and O
violations O
, O
and O
as O
we O
know O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
during O
long O
years O
of O
the O
uprising O
and O
%pw O
years O
of O
occupation O
, O
we O
did O
not O
witness O
any O
case O
of O
a O
real O
trial O
for O
any O
ah O
anyone O
committing O
one O
of O
these O
crimes O
, O
neither O
at O
the O
political O
level O
, O
nor O
at O
the O
military O
level O
. O

Aha O
. O

Aha O
. O

Aha O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
Barak B-PERSON
as O
they O
say O
, O
and O
admits O
that O
killing O
outside O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
law O
is O
permissible O
, O
gives O
it O
legitimacy O
, O
this O
is O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
impudence O
in O
itself O
no O
more O
. O

In O
your O
opinion O
such O
law O
, O
how O
could O
it O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
be O
used O
on O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
and O
diplomatic O
levels O
in O
front O
of O
the O
world O
? O

The O
Israeli B-NORP
judiciary O
gives O
an O
authorization O
to O
every O
Israeli B-NORP

to O
commit O
murder O

he O
wo O

there O

he O
has O
extensively O

the O

a O
theory O
that O
mankind O

generation O

carbon O

through O
increased O

is O
creating O
a O

that O
will O
work O
important O
climatic O
changes O
in O
the O
earth O

over O

`` O
I O
would O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
admit O
that O
there O
is O
not O
a O
complete O
consensus O
in O

on O
either O
one O
of O
these O
problems O
, O
'' O
says O
Mr. O
Teagan B-PERSON

`` O
In O
the O
kind O
of O
literature O
I O
read O
I O
come O
across O
countervailing O
opinions O
quite O
frequently O
. O

But O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
problem O
is O
such O
that O
many O
others O
feel O
it O
has O
to O
be O
addressed O
soon O
, O
before O
all O
the O
evidence O
is O
in O
. O

We O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
wait O
. O
'' O

But O
does O
it O
have O
to O
be O
so O
soon O
? O

Some O
atmospheric O
scientists O
think O
that O
even O
if O
CFCs O
were O
released O
into O
the O
atmosphere O
at O
an O
accelerating O
rate O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
ozone O
depletion O
would O
be O
only B-PERCENT
10 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
by O
the B-DATE
middle I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
next I-DATE
century I-DATE
. O

It O
's O
easy O
to O
get O
something O
comparable O
by O
simply O
moving O
to O
a O
higher O
altitude O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
. O

Moreover O
, O
there O
are O
questions O
, O
particularly O
among O
atmospheric O
scientists O
who O
know O
this O
subject O
best O
, O
about O
the O
ability O
of O
anyone O
to O
know O
what O
in O
fact O
is O
happening O
to O
the O
ozone O
layer O
. O

It O
is O
generally O
agreed O
that O
when O
CFCs O
rise O
from O
earth O
to O
stratosphere O
, O
the O
chlorine O
in O
them O
is O
capable O
of O
interfering O
with O
the O
process O
through O
which O
ultraviolet O
rays O
split O
oxygen O
molecules O
and O
form O
ozone O
. O

But O
ozone O
creation O
is O
a O
very O
large O
- O
scale O
natural O
process O
and O
the O
importance O
of O
human O
- O
generated O
CFCs O
in O
reducing O
it O
is O
largely O
a O
matter O
of O
conjecture O
. O

The O
ozone O
layer O
is O
constantly O
in O
motion O
and O
thus O
very O
hard O
to O
measure O
. O

What O
scientists O
have O
known O
since O
the O
late O
1970s O
is O
that O
there O
is O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
layer O
over O
Antarctica B-LOC
that O
expands O
or O
contracts O
from O
year B-DATE
to O
year B-DATE
. O

But O
it O
is O
at O
least O
worthy O
of O
some O
note O
that O
there O
are O
very O
few O
refrigerators O
in O
Antarctica B-LOC
. O

Moreover O
, O
surely O
someone O
has O
noticed O
that O
household O
refrigerators O
are O
closed O
systems O
, O
running O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
without O
either O
the O
CFC O
gas O
or O
the O
insulation O
ever O
escaping O
. O

Another O
argument O
of O
the O
environmentalists O
is O
that O
if O
substitutes O
are O
available O
, O
why O
not O
use O
them O
? O

Mr. O
Teagan B-PERSON
cites O
a O
list O
of O
substitutes O
but O
none O
, O
so O
far O
, O
match O
the O
nonflammable O
, O
nontoxic O
CFCs O
. O

Butane O
and O
propane O
can O
be O
used O
as O
coolants O
, O
for O
example O
, O
but O
are O
flammable O
. O

Moreover O
, O
new O
lubricants O
will O
be O
needed O
to O
protect O
compressors O
from O
the O
new O
formulations O
, O
which O
, O
as O
with O
CFCs O
, O
are O
solvents O
. O

Mr. O
Teagan B-PERSON
points O
out O
as O
well O
that O
if O
the O
equipment O
designed O
to O
get O
along O
without O
CFCs O
is O
less O
efficient O
than O
current O
devices O
, O
energy O
consumption O
will O
rise O
and O
that O
will O
worsen O
the O
greenhouse O
effect O
. O

Folks O
in O
the O
Midwest B-LOC
who O
just O
suffered O
a O
mid-October B-DATE
snowstorm O
may O
wonder O
where O
the O
greenhouse O
was O
when O
they O
needed O
it O
, O
but O
let O
's O
not O
be O
flippant O
about O
grave O
risks O
. O

As O
it O
happens O
, O
Arthur B-ORG
D. I-ORG

not O

ask O
why O
it O
was O
that O
Du B-ORG

so O
quickly O
capitulated O

One B-CARDINAL
answer O
is O
that O

are O
trying O
instead O
to O
cash O

put O
it O
quite O
that O
way O

Behind O
all O
the O
hoopla O
is O
some O
heavy O
- O
duty O
competition O
. O

As O
individual O
investors O
have O
turned O
away O
from O
the O
stock O
market O
over O
the B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
securities O
firms O
have O
scrambled O
to O
find O
new O
products O
that O
brokers O
find O
easy O
to O
sell O
. O

And O
the O
firms O
are O
stretching O
their O
nets O
far O
and O
wide O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Financial O
planners O
often O
urge O
investors O
to O
diversify O
and O
to O
hold O
a O
smattering O
of O
international O
securities O
. O

And O
many O
emerging O
markets O
have O
outpaced O
more O
mature O
markets O
, O
such O
as O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
and O
Japan B-GPE
. O

Country O
funds O
offer O
an O
easy O
way O
to O
get O
a O
taste O
of O
foreign O
stocks O
without O
the O
hard O
research O
of O
seeking O
out O
individual O

. O

But O
it O
does O
n't O
take O
much O
to O
get O
burned O
. O

Political O
and O
currency O
gyrations O
can O
whipsaw O
the O
funds O
. O

Another O
concern O
: O
The O
funds O
' O
share O
prices O
tend O
to O
swing O
more O
than O
the O
broader O
market O
. O

When O

Oct. B-DATE

, O
for O

, O
the O
Mexico B-GPE

plunged O
about B-PERCENT
18 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
and O
the O
Spain B-GPE

fell O
16 B-PERCENT

And O
most O
country O
funds O
were O
clobbered O
more O
than O
most O
stocks O
after O
the O
1987 B-DATE
crash O
. O

What O
's O
so O
wild O
about O
the O
funds O
' O
frenzy O
right O
now O
is O
that O
many O
are O
trading O
at O
historically O
fat O
premiums O
to O
the O
value O
of O
their O
underlying O
portfolios O
. O

After O
trading O
at O
an O
average O

of O
more B-PERCENT

20 I-PERCENT

year I-DATE
, O
country O
funds O
currently O
trade O
at O
an O
average O
premium O
of O
6 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

The O
reason O
: O
Share O
prices O
of O
many O
of O
these O
funds O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
have O
climbed O
much O
more O
sharply O
than O
the O
foreign O
stocks O
they O
hold O
. O

It O
's O
probably O
worth O
paying O
a O
premium O
for O
funds O
that O
invest O
in O
markets O
that O
are O
partially O
closed O
to O
foreign O
investors O
, O
such O
as O
South B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
some O
specialists O
say O
. O

But O
some O
European B-NORP
funds O
recently O
have O
skyrocketed O
; O
Spain B-GPE
Fund O
has O
surged O
to O
a O
startling O
120 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
premium O
. O

It O
has O
been O
targeted O
by O
Japanese B-NORP
investors O
as O
a O
good O
long O
- O
term O
play O
tied O
to O
1992 B-DATE
's O
European B-NORP
economic O
integration O
. O

And O
several O
new O
funds O
that O
are O
n't O
even O
fully O
invested O
yet O
have O
jumped O
to O
trade O
at O
big O
premiums O
. O

`` O
I O

very O
alarmed O
to O
see O
these O
rich O

, O
'' O
says O
Smith B-ORG
Barney I-ORG

Mr. O
Porter B-PERSON
. O

The O

reflect O
the O
increasingly O
global O
marketing O
of O
some O
country O
funds O
, O
Mr. O
Porter B-PERSON
suggests O
. O

Unlike O
many O
U.S. B-GPE
investors O
, O
those O
in O
Asia B-LOC
or O
Europe B-LOC
seeking O
foreign O
- O
stock O
exposure O
may O
be O
less O
resistant O
to O
paying O
higher O
prices O
for O
country O

. O

`` O
There O
may O
be O
an O
international O
viewpoint O
cast O
on O
the O
funds O

here O
, O
'' O
Mr. O
Porter B-PERSON
says O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
plenty O
of O
U.S. B-GPE
analysts O
and O
money O
managers O
are O
aghast O
at O
the O
lofty O
trading O
levels O
of O
some O
country O

. O

They O
argue O
that O
U.S. B-GPE
investors O
often O
can O
buy O
American B-NORP
depositary O
receipts O
on O
the O
big O

these O
so O

called O

in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
. O

That O
way O
investors O
can O
essentially O
buy O
the O
funds O
without O
paying O
the O
premium O
. O

For O
people O
who O
insist O
on O
jumping O

buy O
the O

Newgate B-ORG

Mr. O

is O

A O

These O
mega-issues O
are O
being O
propelled O
by O
two B-CARDINAL
factors O
, O
economic O
and O
political O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
the O
socialist O
policies O
of O
the O
government O
strictly O
limited O
the O
size O
of O
new O
steel O
mills O
, O
petrochemical O
plants O
, O
car O
factories O
and O
other O
industrial O
concerns O
to O
conserve O
resources O
and O
restrict O
the O
profits O
businessmen O
could O
make O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
industry O
operated O
out O
of O
small O
, O
expensive O
, O
highly O
inefficient O
industrial O
units O
. O

When O
Mr. O
Gandhi B-PERSON
came O
to O
power O
, O
he O
ushered O
in O
new O
rules O
for O
business O
. O

He O
said O
industry O
should O
build O
plants O
on O
the O
same O
scale O
as O
those O
outside O
India B-GPE
and O
benefit O
from O
economies O
of O
scale O
. O

If O
the O
output O
was O
too O
great O
for O
the O
domestic O
market O
, O
he O
said O
, O
companies O
should O
export O
. O

India B-GPE
's O
overregulated O
businessmen O
had O
to O
be O
persuaded O
, O
but O
they O
have O
started O
to O
think O
big O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
projects O
being O
funded O
by O
the O
new O
issues O
are O
the O
first O
fruits O
of O
Mr. O
Gandhi B-PERSON
's O
policy O
, O
and O
they O
require O
more O
capital O
than O
the O
smaller O
industrial O
units O
built O
in O
the O
past O
. O

The O
industrial O
revolution O
has O
produced O
an O
explosion O
in O
the O
capital O
market O
, O
which O
is O
a O
far O
cheaper O
source O
of O
funds O
than O
government O
- O
controlled O
banks O
, O
where O
interest O
rates O
for O
prime O
borrowers O
are O
around O
16 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
factor O
spurring O
mega-issues O
is O
political O
. O

Mr. O
Gandhi B-PERSON
has O
called O
general O
elections O
for O
November B-DATE
, O
and O
many O
businessmen O
fear O
that O
he O
and O
his O
Congress B-ORG
-LRB- O
I O
-RRB- O
Party O
will O
lose O
. O

Some O
companies O
are O
raising O
money O
in O
anticipation O
of O
a O
government O
less O
predictable O
than O
Mr. O
Gandhi B-PERSON
's O
, O
and O
possibly O
more O
restrictive O
. O

The O
buoyant O
Bombay B-GPE
rumor O
mill O
also O
says O
that O
some O
of O
the O
money O
raised O
in O
the O
current O

of O

will O
be O
used O
as O
campaign O
donations O

the O

No O

anything O

it O

Because O

Um O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
police O
should O
all O
have O
their O
own O
district O
of O
jurisdiction O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

If O
he O
's O
going O
to O
leave O
your O
, O
this O
, O
district O
of O
jurisdiction O
, O
there O
might O
be O
some O
problems O
when O
making O
an O
arrest O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
be O
as O
, O
this O
, O
convenient O
as O
in O
your O
own O
jurisdiction O
. O

Ah O
, O
it O
'll O
be O
troublesome O
. O

Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
yes O
. O

What O
do O
you O
do O
when O
you O
encounter O
such O
a O
situation O
. O

I O
would O
have O
the O
security O
guards O
follow O
him O
and O
conceal O
myself O
well O
. O

I O
myself O
, O
eh O
, O
am O
a O
plain O
- O

policeman O
, O
so O
I O
would O
carry O
my O
work O
ID O
and O
wait O
somewhere O
he O
would O
show O
up O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Do O
n't O
move O
. O

I O
took O

a O

then O
taking O
off O

pulling O
out O

. O

Uh-huh O

. O

The O
thing O
is O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
city I-GPE
it O
might O
be O
hot O
but O
at O

like O
the O

or O
you O
'll O
get O
like O
those O
big O
yeah O
those O
big O
city O

like O
coming O

Those O
big O
city O
bre- O

yes O
I O
do O

you O
get O
some O

You O

like O
the O

th- O
there O

to O
get O
around O
to O
the O
places O
that O
I O
need O
to O
get O
to O
because O
%eh O
things O
are O
so O
sort O
of O
scattered O
around O

they O
're O
like O
it O
's O
like O
being O
like O

without O

%um O
you O
know O
the O

that O

basis O

Anyway O

You O
're O
so O
bad O
. O

Anyway O

so O
so O
that O
's O
why O
I O
'm O
yawning O
. O

%um O
but O
%um O
anyway O
%uh O

what O
was O
I O
going O
to O
say O
%um O

so O
it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
settle O
in O
because O

and O
i- O
and O
I O
'm O
still O
not O
totally O
settled O
in O
. O

I O
've O
started O
to O
do O
s- O
%um O
some O
work O

I O
did O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
month O
that O
I O
was O
here O
I O
took O
a O
class O
in O
digital O
music O
%um O
which O
is O
like O
electronic O
you O
know O
like O
music O
editing O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O

oh O
cool O

mhm O

oh O
that O
's O
great O
. O

And O
because O
I O
've O
been O
w- O
you O
know O
working O
with O
sound O
and O
I O
'm O
interested O
in O
working O
more O
with O
sound O
and O
stuff O

and O
so O
that O
was O
really O
good O

we O
there O
was O
a O
concert O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O

and O
I O
felt O
that O
's O
great O
pretty O
good O
about O
my O
contribution O
to O
that O

like O
it O
was O
n't O
really O
exactly O
what O
I O
would O
want O

but O
I O
felt O
like O
like O
I O

oh O
that O
's O
great O
. O

yeah O

so O
that O
was O
g- O
that O
was O
good O

that O
was O
something O
that O
you O
know O
like O
y- O
being O
here O
gave O
me O
access O
to O
. O

I O
'm O
also O
learning O
a O
lot O
about O
computers O
like O
%um O
like O
about O
other O
things O
about O
computers O
like O
about O
%um O
you O
know O
how O
to O
do O
email O
and O
how O
to O
do O
like O
Email O
's O
interesting O
. O
networking O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
mean O
if O
you O
get O
if O
you O
get O
a O
laptop O
and O
you O
should O
also O
try O
to O
get O
a O
modem O
and O
hook O
it O
up O
to O
a O
phone O
because O
then O
you O
can O
have O

I O
may O
have O
to O

well O
I O
mean O
like O
I O
have O
a O
lapt- O
I O
have O
a O
an O
email O
address O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
else O
that O
you O
know O
has O
an O
email O
address O

but O
it O
's O
the O
kind O
of O
thing O
that O
I O
would O
like O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
t- O

You O
can O
get O
contact O
with O
people O
easy O
. O

yeah O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
like O
tell O
people O
because O
it O
only O
costs O
like O
a O
local O
phone O
call O

like O
if O
you O
if O
you O
call O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
I O
mean O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
write O
to O
somebody O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
you O
could O
like O
you O
could O
like O
type O
it O
up O

It O
's O
like O
a O
%eh O
a O
fax O
%uh O
thing O
. O

yeah O

it O
's O
but O
it O
's O
better O

it O
's O
even O
cheaper O
than O
a O
fax O
I O
think O
because O
it O
's O
%um O

yeah O

and O
it O
it O
goes O
into O
the O
computer O

it O
's O
not O
like O
with O
paper O
. O

Right O

it O
's O
not O
with O
paper O

but O
it O
's O
and O
it O
's O
cheaper O
because O
it O
's O
c- O
it O
's O
the O
cost O
of O
a O
local O
phone O
call O
whereas O
a O
fax O
takes O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
that O
the O
that O
the O
phone O
call O

oh O
that O
's O
great O
. O

No O

it O
's O
really O
great O

and O
then O
you O
can O
get O
access O
to O
all O
any O
as O
any O
information O
you O
really O
need O

I O
mean O
if O
you O
needed O
something O
about O
research O
or O
whatever O
you O

Right O

right O

yeah O

This O
is O
amazing O
to O
me O
. O

yeah O

so O
yeah O
like O
the O
internet O
and O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O

so O
that O
's O
that O
's O
like O

so O
I O
'm O
learning O
about O
that O

so O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
cool O

and O
%um O
and O
then O
%uh O
That O
's O
great O
and O
I O
'm O
supposed O
to O
start O
teaching O
in O
September B-DATE
. O

I O
mean O
I O
'm O

America B-GPE

So O

so O

%um O

yeah O

it O
's O
like O
I O
I O
I O
am O
a O
little O
ner- O

I O
mean O
the O
thing O
is O
I O
've O
never O
taught O
a O
class O

well O
that O
's O
not O
true O
. O

I O
taught O
the O
same O
class O
in O
Germany B-GPE

but O
it O
was O
different O
%um O

yeah O

what O
about O
upstate B-LOC
New I-LOC
York I-LOC

you O
did O
it O

you O
teach O

That O
was O
teaching O
I O
was O
teaching O
three B-CARDINAL
D O
design O
which O
is O
really O
different O
because O
that O
was O
freshmen O

these O
are O
like O
graduate O
students O
I O
think O

oh O
really O

oh O
that O
's O
well O
that O
's O
that O
's O
intense O

well O
how O
many O
how O
often O
do O
you O
see O
them O

I O
teach O
twice O
it O
's O
twice O
a O
week O
for O
th- O

we O
meet O
for O
three B-TIME
hours I-TIME

and O
%um O

so O
anyway O
so O
that O
's O
going O
on O

so O
%um O

That O
's O
great O
though O
. O

but O
I O
mean O
it O
's O
good O

it O
's O
weird O

like O
I O
've O
been O
having O
you O
know O

the O
thing O
about O
you O
're O
s- O
saying O
like O
about O
you O
know O
like O
giving O
up O
the O
apartment O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
and O
those O
kinds O
of O
things O
I O
mean O
I O
've O
been O
thinking O
about O
those O
kinds O
of O
things O
again O
also O
yeah O
. O
because O
you O
know O
I O
think O
to O
myself O
like O
you O
know O
I O
could O
make O
life O
easier O
for O
myself O

I O
could O
come O
to O
Berlin B-GPE

I O
could O
probably O
like O
you O
know O
make O
a O
you O
know O
you O
know O
get O
the O
paperwork O
in O
order O
and O
make O

If O

It O

also O

He O

I O
could O
either O

He O
was O

that O

you O

it O

The O
conclusion O
by O
a O
team O
of O
Times B-ORG
reporters O
. O

The O
Times B-ORG
incurred O
millions B-MONEY
of I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
in O
legal O
fees O
in O
Miss O
Miller B-PERSON
's O
case O
. O

It O
limited O
its O
own O
ability O
to O
cover O
aspects O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
biggest O
scandals O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE

Even O
as O
the O

asked O
for O
the O

it O
was O
unable O
to O
answer O
its O

Among O
the O
journalistic O

Miller B-PERSON
released O

last B-DATE

says O
she O
pushed O

a O

on O
the O

back O
in O
two B-DATE

She O
never O

one B-CARDINAL
. O

but O
that O
her O
former O
boss O
says O
no O
way O
. O

that O
never O
happened O
. O

And O
the O
Times B-ORG
was O
so O
conflicted O
in O

the O

killed O

Well O
an O
honest O
accounting O
. O

yeah O
maybe O
. O

but O
not O
a O
full O
accounting O
. O

You O
know O
and O
if O
the O
whole O
bottom O
line O
of O
this O
mess O
is O
that O
the O
public O
has O
the O
right O
to O
know O
and O
that O
that O
's O
what O
this O
is O
all O
about O
the O
public O
still O
does O
n't O
know O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. O

There O
's O
still O
a O
lot O
of O
questions O
here O
. O

Why O
was O
that O
waiver O
that O
Miller B-PERSON
was O
apparently O
granted O
by O
m- O
uh O
Scooter B-PERSON
Libby I-PERSON
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
ago I-DATE
- O

Why O
did O
it O
wait O
until O
she O
sat O
in O
jail O
for O
all O
that O
time O
before O
she O
actually O
took O
up O
on O
it O
? O

Why O
you O
know O
she O
was O
-- O
she O
's O
referred O
to O
in O
the O
a- O
in O
the O
Times B-ORG
' O
own O
account O
as O
Miss B-PERSON
Run I-PERSON
Amuck I-PERSON
. O

She O
was O
pulled O
off O
of O
certain O
stories O
on O
Iraq B-GPE
's O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
. O

What O
are O
her O
motives O
and O
bottom O
lines O
to O
the O
secrecy O
of O
this O
whole O
thing O
? O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
we O
still O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Miss B-PERSON
Run I-PERSON
Amuck I-PERSON
was O
a O
name O
she O
gave O
herself O
quite O
proudly O
apparently O
. O

Arianna B-PERSON
Huffington I-PERSON
the O
Times B-ORG
piece O
a O
lengthy O
piece O
acknowledges O
that O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
was O
a O
controversial O
figure O
in O
the O
newsroom O
whose O
own O
WMD O
reporting O
was O
wrong O
and O
that O
while O
she O
claims O
to O
have O
pushed O
for O
this O
uh O
story O
on O
Valerie B-PERSON
Plame I-PERSON
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
Jill B-PERSON
Abrahamson I-PERSON
now O
the O
paper O
's O
managing O
editor O
says O
No O
way O
. O

That O
did O
n't O
happen O
. O

In O
other O
words O
there O
's O
a O
dispute O
in O
the O
accounts O
. O

Pretty O
candid O
stuff O
for O
a O
newspaper O
to O
publish O
about O
itself O
would O
n't O
you O
say O
? O

Well O
as O
Frank B-PERSON
said O
there O
are O
many O
unanswered O
questions O
. O

And O
there O
are O
many O
very O
devastating O
eh O
comments O
and O
conclusions O
about O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
as O
a O
journalist O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
Times B-ORG
had O
any O
choice O
though O
Howie B-PERSON
. O
Because O
remember O
as O
a O
press O
reporter O
back O
on O
July B-DATE
twenty I-DATE
- I-DATE
seventh I-DATE
the O
turmoil O
in O
the O
newsroom O
has O
been O
going O
on O
for O
months B-DATE
about O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
and O
the O
way O
the O
paper O
has O
decided O
to O
cover O
the O
story O
and O
the O
way O
they O
decided O
to O
present O
her O
as O
a O
martyr O
for O
the B-LAW
first I-LAW
amendment I-LAW
. O

And O
the O
main O
unanswered O
question O
here O
is O
why O
did O
Arthur B-PERSON
Sulzberger I-PERSON
the O
newspaper O
's O
publisher O
allow O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
to O
hijack O
the O
reporting O
of O
that O
story O
and O
the O
editorial O
policy O
on O
that O
story O
. O

And O
the O
similarities O
for O
the O
Jayson B-PERSON
Blair I-PERSON
case O
. O

Remember O
after O
the O
Jayson B-PERSON
Blair I-PERSON
scandal O
broke O
we O
had O
a O
seven B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
word I-CARDINAL
story O
that O
did O
not O
give O
a O
full O
account O
of O
what O
happened O
. O
Especially O
about O
why O
is O
a O
major O
institution O
like O
the O
Times B-ORG
ignoring O
so O
many O
red O
flags O
. O

Alright O
. O

In O
the O
story O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
things O
that O
we O
learn O
is O
that O
Bill B-PERSON
Keller I-PERSON
took O
off O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
off O
her O
WMD O
beat O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
personnel O
decisions O
when O
he O
took O
eh O
the O
reins O
as O
editor O
. O

Alright O
. O

Well O
I O
uh O
I O
w- O
agree O
there O
are O
some O
unanswered O
questions O
. O

but O
I O
'm O
willing O
to O
give O
the O
Times B-ORG
a O
little O
more O
credit O
than O
you O
for O
at O
least O
to O
attempting O
to O
answer O
uh O
many O
of O
the O
questions O
. O

And O
Lucy B-PERSON
Dalglish I-PERSON
here O
's O
the O
th- O
the O
thing O
that O
jumped O
out O
at O
me O
in O
the O
story O
. O

Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
acknowledges O
that O
at O
Lou- O
at O
Louis B-PERSON
Libby I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
request O
this O
is O
the O
Dick B-PERSON
Cheney I-PERSON
aide O
she O
agreed O
to O
refer O
to O
him O
and O
in O
stories O
not O
as O
a O
senior O
administration O
official O
but O
as O
a O
former O
Hill B-LOC
aide O
because O
he O
had O
once O
worked O
on O
Capitol B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
. O

Do O
you O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
? O

I- O
I O
I O
I O
thought O
that O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
misleading O
. O

And O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
odd O
. O

I O
mean O
her O
justification O
was O
that O
well O
he O
had O
been O
a O
former O
Hill B-LOC
staffer O
. O

Um O
but O
that O
was O
a O
strange O
request O
. O

and O
I O
think O
the O
agreement O
was O
strange O
. O

I O
'll O
-- O
I O
'll O
-- O
I O
'll O
-- O
I O
'll O
agree O
with O
you O
on O
that O
. O

Frank B-PERSON
Sesno I-PERSON
the O
Times B-ORG
was O
so O
hamstrung O
by O
its O
passionate O
embrace O
of O
this O
reporter O
who O
after O
all O
was O
facing O
jail O
did O
go O
to O
jail O
. O

One O
can O
understand O
the O
emotions O
uh O
that O
were O
unleashed O
here O
. O

and O
yet O
the O
editors O
discouraged O
stories O
on O
the O
CIA B-ORG
leak O
investigation O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
killed O
a O
piece O
written O
by O
a O
reporter O
about O
Scooter B-PERSON
Libby I-PERSON
. O

Was O
that O
an O
abdication O
of O
journalistic O
responsibility O
? O

Maybe O
yeah O
maybe O
. O

I O
mean O
and O
it O
shows O
-- O
what O
it O
really O
shows O
Howie B-PERSON
I O
think O
is O
just O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
for O
news O
organizations O
to O
report O
on O
themselves O
. O

You O
know O
wh- O
news O
organizations O
demand O
total O
transparency O
whether O
you O
're O
General B-ORG
Motors I-ORG
or O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
government O
. O

We O
want O
access O
. O

We O
want O
explanation O
. O

We O
want O
full O
disclosure O
. O

But O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
do O
it O
themselves O
. O

In O
this O
case O
and O
the O
Times B-ORG
makes O
it O
very O
plain O
in O
their O
story O
today B-DATE
they O
really O
suffered O
. O

They O
were O
behind O
on O
virtually O
every O
major O
aspect O
of O
the O
story O
. O

Even O
when O
she O
went O
to O
jail O
? O

Even O
when O
she O
went O
to O
jail O
and O
w- O
. O

When O
she O
won O
release O
from O
jail O
. O

Yeah O
w- O
at O
the O
point O
that O
she O
came O
out O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
say O
that O
sh- O
you O
know O
until O
until O
she O
walked O
out O
. O

And O
the O
question O
and O
this O
is O
a O
very O
serious O
question O
it O
's O
not O
answered O
in O
the O
article O
. O

Were O
editorial O
higher O
- O
ups O
and O
were O
the O
corporate O
lawyers O
at O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
in O
some O
way O
leaning O
on O
suppressing O
and O
in- O
in- O
ways O
distorting O
the O
coverage O
from O
the O
news O
uh O
section O
? O

Arianna B-PERSON
Huffington I-PERSON
uh O
in O
this O
lengthy O
piece O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
uh O
the O
New O
York O
Times O
says O
uh O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
is O
quoted O
excuse O
me O
as O
saying O
that O
there O
was O
another O
source O
beside O
Scooter B-PERSON
Libby I-PERSON
that O
she O
dealt O
with O
on O
the O
Valerie B-PERSON
Plame I-PERSON
situation O
. O

She O
does O
n't O
recall O
who O
that O
source O
was O
looking O
at O
her O
notes O
and O
seeing O
the O
uh O
notation O
Valerie B-PERSON
Flame I-PERSON
. O

She O
got O
the O
name O
wrong O
. O

Do O
you O
buy O
this O
notion O
that O
she O
does O
n't O
recall O
who O
this O
other O
source O
was O
? O

No O
of O
course O
not O
Howie B-PERSON
. O

In O
fact O
I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
major O
unanswered O
question O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
eh O
her O
source O
was O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
revealing O
the O
identity O
of O
Valerie B-PERSON
Plame I-PERSON
. O

And O
to O
say O
that O
she O
does O
not O
recall O
is O
really O
as O
convincing O
as O
having O
Woodward B-PERSON
and O
Bernstein B-PERSON
saying O
that O
they O
do O
not O
recall O
who O
Deep B-PERSON
Throat I-PERSON
was O
. O

After O
all O
these O
notes O
were O
just B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
old I-DATE
when O
um O
the O
Valerie B-PERSON
Plame I-PERSON
Bob B-PERSON
Novak I-PERSON
column O
appeared O
and O
when O
the O
whole O
Washington B-GPE
and O
the O
whole O
journalistic O
community O
was O
talking O
about O
it O
. O

You O
know O
I O
do O
n't O
- O

Incidentally O
there O
was O
some O
questions O
uh O
that O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
would O
not O
answer O
to O
her O
colleagues O
. O

and O
she O
would O
n't O
share O
her O
notes O
with O
them O
although O
they O
've O
been O
turned O
over O
to O
the O
special O
prosecutor O
. O

Lucy B-PERSON
Dalglish I-PERSON
the O
big O
news O
for O
me O
was O
Miller B-PERSON
recounting O
what O
her O
lawyer O
Floyd B-PERSON
Abrams I-PERSON
had O
said O
to O
her O
about O
a O
conversation O
that O
he O
had O
with O
Joe B-PERSON
Tate I-PERSON
who O
was O
Scooter B-PERSON
Libby I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
lawyer O
. O

Uh O
says O
um O
Floyd B-PERSON
Abrams I-PERSON
according O
to O
Miller B-PERSON
's O
account O
when O
I O
would O
n't O
give O
him O
Tate B-PERSON
an O
assurance O
that O
you O
would O
exonerate O
Libby B-PERSON
he O
said O
do O
n't O
go O
there O
. O

Now O
Tate B-PERSON
by O
the O
way O
tells O
the O
Times B-ORG
that O
that O
account O
is O
false O
and O
outrageous O
. O

Does O
this O
help O
justify O
eh O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
otherwise O
mysterious O
decision O
to O
go O
to O
jail O
and O
not O
accept O
the O
waiver O
of O
confidentiality O
that O
Scooter B-PERSON
Libby I-PERSON
offered O
and O
sit O
in O
jail O
for O
eighty B-DATE
- I-DATE
five I-DATE
days I-DATE
? O

N- O
you O
n- O
. O

you O
know O
I O
've O
been O
talking O
to O
Judy B-PERSON
off O
and O
on O
about O
this O
case O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

This O
was O
a O
very O
difficult O
decision O
. O

and O
you O
know O
what O
this O
all O
comes O
down O
to O
is O
you O
keep O
your O
promises O
when O
you O
make O
a O
promise O
to O
a O
confidential O
source O
. O

You O
'll O
recall O
six B-DATE
or I-DATE
eight I-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
Howie B-PERSON
I O
w- O
-- O
I O
was O
on O
the O
show O
and O
we O
were O
talking O
about O
you O
know O
did O
Russert B-PERSON
and O
Kessler B-PERSON
and O
and O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
those O
guys O
did O
they O
break O
some O
trust O
by O
agreeing O
to O
testify O
and O
observing O
the O
waiver O
? O

What O
I O
think O
this O
situation O
and O
the O
turmoil O
that O
is O
obviously O
going O
on O
at O
the O
Times B-ORG
right O
now O
points O
out O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
have O
a O
major O
problem O
in O
this O
country O
. O

it O
's O
that O
reporters O
believe O
they O
need O
to O
keep O
their O
promises O
to O
their O
sources O
. O

Reporters O
will O
will O
try O
to O
do O
whatever O
they O
can O
as O
long O
as O
the O
law O
allows O
them O
to O
to O
protect O
those O
sources O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
that O
sources O
these B-DATE
days I-DATE
um O
with O
the O
state O
of O
our O
law O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
federal O
shield O
law O
we O
have O
prosecutors O
and O
civil O
litigants O
going O
in O
there O
and O
interfering O
with O
the O
day O
to O
day O
operation O
of O
our O
newsrooms O
. O

and O
we O
just O
can O
tolerate O
this O
. O

And O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
- O

I O
think O
Lucy B-PERSON
's O
on O
to O
something O
here O
if O
I O
can O
just O
say O
Howie B-PERSON
. O

And O
I O
think O
this O
is O
very O
important O
because O
this O
is O
an O
ugly O
case O
. O

And O
even O
people O
close O
to O
Judith B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
say O
this O
is O
not O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
you O
'd O
really O

You O

the O

the O

you O

hangs O
in O
the O

She O
did O

even O

But O
it O
does O
point O
out O
a O
very O
serious O
issue O
. O

And O
that O
is O
the O
whole O
notion O
of O
the O
use O
of O
and O
abuse O
of O
confidential O
sources O
the O
protections O
that O
reporters O
do O
or O
do O
n't O
have O
and O
the O
propensity O
of O
this O
government O
uh O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
government O
to O
have O
more O
secrecy O
not O
less O
. O

We O
've O
got O
to O
figure O
this O
out O
. O

Well O
just O
to O
clarify O
uh O
she O
did O
ultimately O
uh O
testify O
about O
her O
confidential O
source O
. O

The O
whole O
issue O
was O
how O
voluntary O
was O
the O
waiver O
of O
her O
promise O
to O
Scooter O
*Libby O
Libby B-PERSON
offered O
and O
why O
was O
she O
able O
to O
accept O
after O
being O
in O
jail O
as O
opposed O
to O
before O
being O
in O
jail O
. O

Well O
exactly O
. O

and O
you O
know O
what O
Howie B-PERSON
. O
. O

It O
's O
really O
-- O
it O
's O
really O
time O
for O
Lucy B-PERSON
and O
other O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
defenders O
to O
update O
her O
talking O
points O
because O
what O
Lucy B-PERSON
just O
said O
just O
simply O
does O
not O
wash O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
as O
Howie B-PERSON
said O
she O
did O
testify O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
that O
it O
's O
very O
clear O
from O
the O
stories O
today B-DATE
that O
she O
could O
've O
asked O
uh O
Scooter B-PERSON
Libby I-PERSON
to O
call O
her O
so O
that O
she O
could O
hear O
the O
timber O
of O
his O
voice O
earlier O
. O

All O
of O
that O
could O
have O
happened O
. O

It O
did O
not O
happen O
because O
clearly O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
is O
protecting O
another O
source O
that O
she O
still O
has O
not O
revealed O
to O
the O
American B-NORP
public O
. O

And O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
is O
. O

Lucy B-PERSON
. O

. O

Let O
me O
get O
a O
response O
from O
Lucy B-PERSON
Dalglish I-PERSON
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
very O
obvious O
from O
what O
Judy B-PERSON
wrote O
today B-DATE
she O
is O
protecting O
somebody O
else O
. O

And O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
reasons O
that O
this O
negotiation O
took O
so O
long O
is O
that O
not O
only O
was O
she O
negotiating O
what O
she O
was O
going O
to O
say O
about O
Scooter B-PERSON
Libby I-PERSON
but O
you O
got O
to O
-- O
but O
you O
got O
to O
keep O
in O
mind O
I O
'm O
a O
lawyer O
there O
were O
lawyers O
involved O
in O
this O
. O

They O
had O
to O
negotiate O
with O
Patrick B-PERSON
Fitzgerald I-PERSON
what O
he O
would O
not O
talk O
about O
. O

They O
also O
had O
to O
negotiate O
whether O
or O
not O
there O
would O
be O
any O
type O
of O
um O
y- O
uh O
uh O
obstruction O
charges O
connected O
with O
contacting O
. O

Once O
you O
invoke O
the O
wrath O
or O
the O
extreme O
interest O
of O
a O
federal O
prosecutor O
you O
have O
to O
be O
very O
very O
careful O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
mess O
with O
the O
Feds O
. O

It O
's O
very O
clear O
in O
her O
story O
that O
she O
decided O
finally O
to O
testify O
because O
she O
got O
tired O
of O
jail O
because O
she O
was O
threatened O
with O
criminal O
contempt O
charges O
because O
she O
wanted O
to O
go O
out O
and O
now O
she O
's O
saying O
admitting O
finally O
write O
a O
book O
. O

All O
these O
things O
are O
there O
in O
black O
and O
white O
. O

and O
to O
continue O
to O
portray O
her O
as O
a O
martyr O
is O
not O
going O
to O
work O
. O

And O
on O
that O
point O
Arianna B-PERSON
on O
that O
point O
she O
she O
says O
sh- O
- O

Excuse O
me O
. O

Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
says O
she O
's O
taking O
some O
time O
off O
from O
the O
paper O
. O

She O
wants O
to O
write O
a O
book O
. O

She O
would O
n't O
share O
her O
notes O
with O
her O
colleagues O
who O
were O
writing O
the O
story O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
she O
'll O
ever O
come O
back O
? O

You O
think O
she O
's O
saving O
it O
for O
the O
book O
? O

Well O
it O
's O
very O
clear O
that O
she O
would O
not O
be O
welcome O
in O
the O
newsroom O
. O

And O
it O
's O
very O
clear O
eh O
as O
I O
reported O
again O
that O
when O
Bill B-PERSON
Keller I-PERSON
took O
her O
off O
her O
WMD O
beat O
they O
were O
all O
hoping O
she O
would O
resign O
. O

Instead O
she O
threw O
a O
fit O
. O

but O
she O
stayed O
on O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
journalism O
-- O
a O
journalism O
one B-CARDINAL
oh I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
course O
the O
way O
she O
handled O
both O
the O
WMD O
reporting O
and O
Plame B-EVENT
Gate I-EVENT
. O

Fra- O
Frank O
Sesno O
please O
comment O
. O

Jump O
in O
. O

And O
Howie B-PERSON
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
what O
. O

This O
is O
a O
gigantic O
shot O
across O
the O
bow O
of O
every O
manager O
in O
the O
news O
business O
and O
every O
editor O
and O
every O
executive O
producer O
anyway O
anywhere O
because O
you O
got O
to O
have O
some O
uh O
control O
some O
connection O
with O
your O
correspondants O
and O
your O
reporters O
. O

You O
got O
to O
know O
who O
they O
're O
talking O
to O
at O
some O
level O
anyway O
because O
you O
know O
what O
? O

It O
's O
about O
trust O
with O
the O
public O
. O

and O
it O
's O
about O
thr- O
you O
know O
being O
ending O
up O
in O
j- O
-- O
in O
jail O
or O
in O
court O
. O

The O
story O
their O
story O
says O
that O
Bill B-PERSON
Keller I-PERSON
and O
Arthur B-PERSON
Sulzberger I-PERSON
did O
not O
press O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
about O
her O
conversations O
with O
Libby B-PERSON
or O
ask O
to O
see O
her O
notes O
while O
they O
were O
defending O
her O
. O

Ask O
to O
see O
her O
. O

And O
by O
the O
way O
we O
invited O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
to O
have O
an O
editor O
appear O
on O
this O
program O
. O

The O
paper O
declined O
. O

When O
we O
come O
back O
media O
speculation O
run O
amuck O
over O
possible O
indictments O
at O
sixteen O
hundred O
Pennsylvania B-FAC
and O
the O
President O
's O
scripted O
session O
with O
troops O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Stay O
with O
us O
. O

Welcome O
back O
to O
Reliable B-WORK_OF_ART
Sources I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

As O
the O
CIA B-ORG
leak O
investigation O
continued O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
media O
folks O
did O
plenty O
of O
speculating O
with O
no O
evidence O
about O
the O
possible O
indictment O
of O
a O
certain O
top O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
official O
who O
testified O
before O
the O
grand O
jury O
for O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
time O
on O
Friday B-DATE
. O

Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
his O
closest O
aide O
the O
number B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
man O
in O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
the O
man O
that O
has O
been O
called O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
brain O
. O

If O
he O
's O
indicted O
and O
has O
to O
go O
it O
undermines O
the O
key O
source O
of O
this O
President O
's O
public O
support O
his O
character O
. O

If O
Rove B-PERSON
gets O
indicted O
that O
could O
bring O
down O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
I O
think O
. O

My O
understanding O
from O
talking O
to O
somebody O
quite O
close O
to O
this O
investigation O
is O
that O
they O
think O
there O
are O
going O
to O
be O
indictments O
. O

and O
possibly O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
could O
be O
among O
them O
. O

Lucy B-PERSON
Dalglish I-PERSON
if O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
is O
indicted O
, O
if O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
is O
indicted O
, O
what O
if O
he O
's O
not O
indicted O
? O

Is O
n't O
this O
the O
worst O
kind O
of O
journalistic O
speculation O
? O

Yeah O
. O

You O
know O
I O
I O
think O
it O
's O
always O
dangerous O
to O
speculate O
whether O
or O
not O
y- O
you O
're O
really O
besmirching O
someone O
's O
reputation O
. O
Although O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
you O
can O
do O
that O
with O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
. O

But O
it O
uh O
is O
very O
very O
you O
know O
eh O
irre- O
- O

I O
I O
would O
prefer O
that O
people O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
what O
the O
test- O
-- O
you O
know O
watching O
him O
testify O
and O
going O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
courthouse O
. O

But O
uh O
will O
it O
bring O
down O
the O
administration O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Ah O
eh O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Well O
nobody O
knows O
. O

That O
's O
the O
point O
. O

Arianna B-PERSON
Huffington I-PERSON
I O
used O
to O
cover O
the O
justice O
department O
. O

Not O
everybody O
who O
's O
under O
investigation O
winds O
up O
getting O
indicted O
. O

Ah O
but O
you O
certainly O
and O
you O
're O
uh O
on O
a O
blog O
so O
maybe O
it O
's O
a O
different O
standard O
have O
speculated O
about O
Rove B-PERSON
's O
fate O
as O
well O
. O

Well O
not O
just O
Rove B-PERSON
though O
. O

what O
we O
have O
speculated O
is O
that O
it O
might O
be O
a O
much O
more O
tangled O
web O
that O
Fitzgerald B-PERSON
is O
after O
the O
whole O
Iraq B-GPE
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
group O
the O
group O
that O
uh O
in O
Cheney B-PERSON
's O
office O
with O
Libby B-PERSON
and O
Rove B-PERSON
and O
Mary B-PERSON
Matalin I-PERSON
and O
Condoleezza B-PERSON
Rice I-PERSON
and O
a O
lot O
of O
administration O
officials O
basically O
sold O
um O
a O
war O
to O
the O
American B-NORP
public O
based O
on O
lies O
. O

I O
mean O
that O
is O
really O
the O
web O
. O

But O
it O
seems O
and O
we O
find O
out O
today B-DATE
also O
from O
uh O
um O
the O
reporting O
on O
the O
Miller B-PERSON
story O
, O
that O
uh O
Fitzgerald B-PERSON
is O
after O
Cheney B-PERSON
even O
in O
some O
of O
the O
questioning O
eh O
of O
Miller B-PERSON
. O

I O
think O
those O
were O
fairly O
routine O
questions O
about O
. O

you O
you O
you O
d- O
have O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
there O
. O

you O
ask O
about O
Cheney B-PERSON
. O
. O

He O
was O
being O
thorough O
. O

I O
think O
we O
're O
overthinking O
this O
whole O
thing O
. O

Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
and O
this O
speculation O
business O
you O
know O
. O

Frank B-PERSON
Sesno I-PERSON
/. I-PERSON

Pat B-PERSON
Fitzgerald I-PERSON
/. I-PERSON

It O
's O
very O
easy O
to O
sit O
here O
and O
say O
oh O
we O
should O
never O
speculate O
in O
journalism O
. O

It O
's O
irresponsible O
journalism O
. O

It O
's O
really O
how O
you O
speculate O
not O
that O
you O
speculate O
. O

The O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
that O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
has O
been O
to O
the O
grand O
jury O
four B-CARDINAL
times O
. O

The O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
that O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
people O
in O
Washington B-GPE
and O
believe O
me O
they O
're O
not O
all O
journalists O
who O
are O
speculating O
what O
if O
the O
guy O
gets O
indicted O
. O

It O
would O
be O
irresponsible O
I O
think O
for O
the O
media O
not O
to O
reflect O
what O
the O
the O
th- O
discussion O
is O
here O
in O
town O
. O

And O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
Republicans B-NORP
mostly O
Republicans B-NORP
who O
are O
worried O
about O
this O
. O

Alright O
I O
want O
to O
turn O
now O
to O
the O
uh O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
uh O
meeting O
uh O
uh O
photo O
op O
some O
called O
it O
with O
US B-GPE
troops O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
whether O
it O
was O
staged O
how O
shocking O
that O
would O
be O
. O

Let O
's O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
actual O
footage O
. O

And O
in O
your O
interactions O
with O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
civilians O
in O
Tikrit B-GPE
Saddam B-PERSON
's O
hometown O
how O
are O
they O
reacting O
to O
this O
pro- O
political O
process O
? O

Sir O
in O
the O
north O
central O
area O
of O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
voter O
registration O
has O
increased O
seventeen B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O

Can O
you O
give O
us O
a O
sense O
for O
the O
reception O
of O
the O
people O
there O
in O
Tikrit B-GPE
? O

Sir O
in O
north O
central O
Iraq B-GPE
voter O
regis- O
- O

Are O
you O
stunned O
? O

Are O
you O
stunned O
? O

Shocked O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
it O
. O

they O
rehearsed O
it O
. O

They O
rehearsed O
it O
. O

They O
rehearsed O
it O
. O

Yeah O
you O
know O
something O
? O

I O
uh O
I O
remember O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
Michael B-PERSON
Deaver I-PERSON
the O
ultimate O
image O
meister O
for O
Ronald B-PERSON
Reagan I-PERSON
said O
my O
job O
is O
to O
light O
the O
President O
well O
and O
for O
everything O
I O
do O
to O
put O
the O
President O
in O
a O
good O
light O
. O

Now O
look O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
this O
is O
uncomfortable O
to O
see O
. O

and O
what O
the O
problem O
this O
now O
creates O
for O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
is O
{is} O
it O
plays O
into O
the O
credibility O
issue O
that O
the O
President O
has O
that O
everything O
now O
is O
becoming O
a O
photo O
op O
and O
and O
a O
rehearsed O
event O
in O
order O
to O
rescue O
what O
are O
tumbling O
numbers O
on O
his O
performance O
on O
public O
support O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
the O
whole O
bit O
. O

But O
the O
fact O
that O
anybody O
would O
think O
that O
you O
would O
do O
something O
like O
this O
a O
remote O
. O

I O
mean O
anybody O
in O
television O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
's O
complicated O
business O
. O

You O
have O
satellite O
delay O
. O

You O
have O
a B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
dozen I-CARDINAL
people O
sitting O
there O
. O

Who O
's O
going O
to O
speak O
when O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
want O
awkward O
silences O
. O

You O
're O
going O
to O
walk O
through O
it O
. O

so O
that O
it O
happened O
does O
n't O
surprise O
me O
. O

That O
it O
hurts O
the O
President O
yeah O
that O
's O
inevitable O
too O
. O

Arianna B-PERSON
Huffington I-PERSON
does O
the O
staging O
here O
surprise O
you O
at O
all O
? O

Well O
it O
's O
not O
the O
question O
of O
surpising O
me O
Howie B-PERSON
. O

It O
's O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
war O
. O

This O
is O
not O
just O
any O
photo O
opportunity O
. O

Of O
course O
that O
's O
part O
and O
parcel O
of O
the O
presidency O
. O

But O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
a O
war O
in O
which O
almost B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
young O
Americans B-NORP
have O
died O
. O

And O
we O
are O
also O
using O
soldiers O
as O
props O
. O

Yes O
it O
is O
shocking O
. O

and O
I O
think O
Keith B-PERSON
Olbermann I-PERSON
did O
a O
phenomenal O
job O
at O
exposing O
this O
on O
MSNBC B-ORG
. O

Alright O
. O

And O
I O
think O
more O
and O
more O
journalists O
are O
actually O
taking O
a O
hard O
look O
at O
what O
this O
administration O
is O
doing O
. O

And O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
leave O
it O
there O
. O

Last O
word O
. O

and O
the O

the O

that O
killed O
nineteen B-CARDINAL
US B-GPE
marines O
in O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
. O

I O
was O
very O
disappointed O
that O
the O
political O
leadership O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
uh O
would O
tell O
the O
families O
of O
these O
nineteen B-CARDINAL
heroes O
that O
we O
were O
going O
to O
leave O
no O
stone O
unturned O
and O
find O
the O
people O
who O
killed O
them O
. O

to O
give O
that O
order O
to O
the O
director O
because O
that O
's O
the O
order O
that O
I O
got O
and O
then O
to O
do O
nothing O
to O
assist O
and O
facilitate O
that O
investigation O
in O
fact O
to O
undermine O
it O
. O

The O
Clinton B-PERSON
people O
were O
furious O
at O
the O
way O
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
hailed O
the O
segment O
. O

and O
here O
to O
talk O
back O
is O
former O
Clinton B-PERSON
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
attorney O
Lanny B-PERSON
Davis I-PERSON
. O

Welcome O
. O

Let O
's O
deal O
with O
the O
substance O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

Louis B-PERSON
Freeh I-PERSON
says O
that O
when O
Clinton B-PERSON
met O
with O
Crown B-PERSON
Prince I-PERSON
Abdullah I-PERSON
in O
nineteen B-DATE
ninety I-DATE
- I-DATE
eight I-DATE
, O
he O
did O
n't O
press O
for O
FBI B-ORG
access O
to O
suspects O
in O
the O
Khobar B-FAC
Towers I-FAC
bombing O
and O
he O
hit O
up O
the O
prince O
for O
a O
contribution O
to O
his O
presidential O
library O
. O

Well O
not O
only O
is O
that O
false O
and O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
has O
said O
so O
but O
everybody O
at O
the O
meeting O
who O
attended O
the O
meeting O
not O
including O
Louis B-PERSON
Freeh I-PERSON
says O
it O
's O
false O
. O

And O
my O
problem O
with O
Sixty O
Minutes O
is O
that O
they O
never O
called O
anybody O
at O
the O
meeting O
. O

Until O
Friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
we O
did O
n't O
even O
know O
the O
charge O
was O
being O
made O
. O

And O
even O
then O
they O
were O
unwilling O
to O
put O
somebody O
on O
the O
air O
to O
contradict O
Mister O
Freeh B-PERSON
. O

Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
says O
Bill B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
was O
offered O
a O
chance O
to O
come O
on O
and O
give O
his O
rebuttal O
. O

What O
's O
wrong O
with O
that O
? O

Well O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
it O
's O
absolutely O
amazing O
that O
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
thinks O
it O
's O
okay O
to O
air O
a O
false O
and O
malicious O
statement O
. O

This O
is O
a O
terrible O
charge O
that O
an O
FBI B-ORG
investigation O
was O
thwarted O
because O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
wanted O
to O
receive O
money O
for O
his O
library O
. O

The O
charge O
was O
false O
. O

and O
the O
only O
way O
that O
that O
can O
be O
countered O
is O
a O
former O
president O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
? O

What O
about O
anybody O
at O
the O
meeting O
who O
was O
willing O
to O
be O
on O
? O

What O
about O
them O
doing O
reporting O
themselves O
before O
they O
air O
a O
false O
and O
demonstrably O
false O
charge O
? O

That O
's O
my O
problem O
. O

What O
about O
Sandy B-PERSON
Berger I-PERSON
the O
former O
national O
security O
advisor O
under O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
? O

He O
was O
at O
the O
meeting O
. O

He O
was O
in O
the O
room O
. O

Did O
you O
offer O
him O
for O
an O
on O
- O
camera O
interview O
? O

Well O
on O
Friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O

You O
were O
n't O
there O
. O

I O
was O
not O
there O
. O

You O
're O
good O
on O
television O
. O

but O
you O
were O
n't O
there O
. O

I O
uh O
I O
talked O
to O
Sandy B-PERSON
Berger I-PERSON
. O

We O
issued O
a O
statement O
from O
Mister O
Berger B-PERSON
. O

but O
this O
was O
Friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
when O
we O
first B-ORDINAL
learned O
about O
it O
with O
Sunday B-DATE
broadcast O
. O

Why O
did O
n't O
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
invite O
Mister O
Berger B-PERSON
or O
other O
people O
at O
the O
meeting O
before O
Friday B-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
? O

Why O
did O
it O
take O
us O
to O
get O
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
to O
do O
basic O
reporting O
to O
verify O
facts O
? O

It O
's O
not O
enough O
to O
have O
Louis B-PERSON
Freeh I-PERSON
say O
something O
is O
so O
based O
on O
an O
anonymous O
source O
. O

That O
's O
poor O
journalism O
. O

On O
that O
point O
let O
me O
read O
a O
statement O
from O
a O
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
spokesman O
. O

And O
this O
involves O
uh O
their O
saying O
that O
they O
contacted O
Clinton B-PERSON
's O
office O
back O
in O
August B-DATE
with O
a O
detailed O
list O
of O
charges O
and O
then O
quote O
in O
subsequent O
phone O
calls O
the O
President O
's O
people O
said O
he O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
interviewed O
. O

They O
gave O
no O
+substantive O
response O
to O
any O
of O
the O
allegations O
until O
Lanny B-PERSON
Davis I-PERSON
launched O
his O
PR O
campaign O
on O
the B-DATE
Thursday I-DATE
before I-DATE
the I-DATE
broadcast I-DATE
and O
offered O
himself O
as O
the O
person O
from O
the O
camp O
who O
would O
merely O
disparage O
and O
attack O
Freeh B-PERSON
rather O
than O
deal O
with O
his O
allegations O
. O

Denials O
from O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
and O
Sandy B-PERSON
Berger I-PERSON
that O
did O
deal O
with O
Freeh B-PERSON
's O
allegations O
were O
included O
in O
the O
Sixty B-WORK_OF_ART
Minutes I-WORK_OF_ART
report O
. O

Well O
first O
of O
all O
it O
's O
false O
to O
say O
that O
I O
was O
asking O
to O
disparage O
Freeh B-PERSON
. O

I O
was O
asking O
to O
tal- O
k- O
talk O
about O
facts O
that O
Freeh B-PERSON
was O
saying O
that O
were O
not O
true O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
mind O
disparaging O
Freeh B-PERSON
. O

M- O
m- O
my O
observation O
. O

N- O
no O
in O
fact O
I O
disparage O
any O
man O
who O
as O
FBI B-ORG
director O
has O
a O
personal O
pique O
rather O
than O
doing O
his O
job O
. O

That O
's O
disparaging O
. O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
it O
is O
absolutely O
a O
misrepresentation O
that O
they O
told O
us O
before O
just B-DATE
the I-DATE
week I-DATE
before I-DATE
. O

When O
Mister O
Carson B-PERSON
the O
representative O
spoke O
to O
Mister O
Wallace B-PERSON
Mister O
Wallace B-PERSON
agreed O
that O
they O
had O
never O
verified O
what O
Mister O
F- O
Fee- O
uh O
Freeh B-PERSON
had O
said O
. O

They O
never O
talked O
to O
Mister O
Freeh B-PERSON
. O

and O
in O
fact O
it O
was O
n't O
until O
that B-DATE
Friday I-DATE
that O
we O
learned O
the O
substance O
of O
Mister O
Freeh B-PERSON
's O
charges O
. O

So O
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
I O
think O
has O
just O
said O
something O
that O
is O
false O
. O

When O
did O
the O
Clinton B-PERSON
team O
find O
out O
that O
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
was O
going O
to O
report O
that O
Louis B-PERSON
Freeh I-PERSON
with O
his O
new O
book O
was O
going O
to O
have O
a O
specific O
+allegation O
specific O
allegation O
about O
Clinton O
's O
handling O
of O
the O
Khobar B-FAC
Towers I-FAC
investigation O
and O
the O
business O
about O
the O
presidential O
library O
soli- O
solicitation O
. O

When O
somebody O
named O
Howard B-PERSON
Kurtz I-PERSON
wrote O
a O
story O
in O
the B-ORG
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
on O
Friday B-TIME
morning I-TIME
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
the O
Clinton B-PERSON
forces O
learned O
about O
that O
false O
and O
demonstrably O
false O
charge O
that O
good O
reporting O
by O
calling O
people O
who O
were O
at O
the O
meeting O
could O
have O
done O
would O
have O
verified O
that O
Mister O
Freeh B-PERSON
made O
a O
false O
charge O
. O

And O
even O
since O
that O
interview O
Mister O
Freeh B-PERSON
has O
backed O
off O
and O
has O
not O
told O
people O
who O
his O
source O
is O
. O

and O
he O
has O
n't O
even O
insisted O
that O
it O
was O
true O
. O

He O
just O
said O
somebody O
told O
him O
it O
was O
true O
. O

Hold O
on O
. O

Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
spokesman O
Kevin B-PERSON
Tedesco I-PERSON
said O
in O
the O
statement O
I O
just O
referred O
to O
that O
the O
Clinton B-PERSON
office O
was O
contacted O
in O
August B-DATE
with O
a O
detailed O
list O
of O
charges O
. O

That O
's O
false O
. O

Are O
you O
saying O
that O
's O
false O
? O

They O
were O
never O
told O
. O
. O

or O
at O
least O
I O
'm O
now O
basing O
this O
on O
what O
Mister O
Carson B-PERSON
has O
told O
me O
. O

Jay B-PERSON
Carson I-PERSON
is O
the O
spokesman O
for O
former O
president O
Bill B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
. O

Jay B-PERSON
Carson I-PERSON
is O
the O
spokesperson O
for O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
was O
not O
informed O
about O
the O
specific O
charge O
about O
the B-FAC
Khobar I-FAC
Towers I-FAC
which O
happens O
to O
be O
not O
true O
. O

President O
Clinton B-PERSON
at O
that O
re- O
uh O
meeting O
did O
press O
the O
uh O
Crown O
Prince O
to O
cooperate O
with O
the O
FBI B-ORG
. O

so O
what O
Mister O
Freeh B-PERSON
said O
was O
false O
. O

That O
was O
not O
understood O
by O
the O
Clinton B-PERSON
people O
until O
it O
was O
read O
in O
the B-ORG
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
in O
the O
story O
that O
you O
wrote O
because O
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
put O
a O
press O
release O
out O
. O

Uh O
now O
look O
Lanny B-PERSON
Davis I-PERSON
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
gave O
Bill B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
one B-TIME
hour I-TIME
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
to O
push O
his O
own O
ten B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
dollar I-MONEY
autobiography O
. O

He O
criticized O
people O
. O

He O
criticized O
Ken B-PERSON
Starr I-PERSON
. O

They O
did O
n't O
have O
Ken B-PERSON
Starr I-PERSON
on O
to O
rebut O
. O

Now O
the O
former O
director O
of O
the B-ORG
Federal I-ORG
Bureau I-ORG
of I-ORG
Investigation I-ORG
uh O
who O
ca O
n't O
stand O
Clinton B-PERSON
clearly O
writes O
a O
book O
gets O
one B-CARDINAL
segment O
for O
his O
book O
. O

and O
you O
cry O
foul O
. O

Nobody O
was O
complaining O
about O
when O
Bill B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
was O
getting O
all O
this O
airtime O
on O
CBS B-ORG
. O

Look O
. O

Look O
this O
is O
a O
program O
about O
good O
journalism O
. O

Let O
's O
ask O
a O
Sixty B-ORG
Minutes I-ORG
uh O
journalist O
to O
say O
do O
you O
have O
an O
obligation O
to O
verify O
a O
charge O
made O
by O
the O
former O
FBI B-ORG
director O
as O
whether O
it O
's O
true O
or O
not O
. O

Is O
it O
good O
enough O
to O
air O
it O
just O
because O
he O
says O
it O
. O

or O
should O
you O
do O
reporting O
? O

Good O
reporters O
would O
hear O
that O
charge O
and O
say O
that O
is O
an O
extremely O
serious O
charge O
to O
be O
levelled O
against O
former O
president O
Clinton B-PERSON
. O

Let O
's O
see O
whether O
it O
's O
true O
and O
start O
making O
phone O
calls O
. O

They O
did O
not O
do O
that O
. O

That O
's O
a O
fact O
. O

thank O
you O

The B-DATE
other I-DATE
day I-DATE
you O
wrote O
that O
if O
you O
were O
the O
editor O
of O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
you O
would O
've O
put O
on O
the O
front O
page O
led O
the O
paper O
with O
the O
news O
of O
recent O
days O
that O
a O
Sunni B-NORP
suicide O
bomber O
on O
Ramadan B-DATE
had O
attacked O
a O
Shiite B-NORP
mosque O
. O

Now O
in O
reality O
the O
world O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
rule O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
Washington B-ORG
Post I-ORG
made O
that O
part O
of O
a O
larger O
story O
on O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Uh O
nobody O
put O
it O
on O
the O
front O
page O
. O

Bad O
news O
judgement O
? O

Uh O
I O
think O
so O
Howie B-PERSON
. O

I O
'm O
not O
here O
to O
cric- O
make O
a O
news O
point O
though O
. O

I O
'm O
really O
making O
a O
larger O
point O
which O
is O
about O
the O
war O
on O
terrorism O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
firm O
believer O
. O

How O
we O
ever O
going O
to O
win O
this O
war O
? O

We O
're O
never O
going O
to O
win O
it O
by O
way O
of O
American B-NORP
intelligence O
finding O
this O
terrorist O
or O
that O
terrorist O
. O

We O
get O
lucky O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

but O
there O
's O
only O
{one?} O
way O
we O
win O
this O
war O
Howie B-PERSON
is O
it O
takes O
a O
village O
. O

It O
only O
happens O
when O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
Muslim I-NORP
world O
basically O
turns O
people O
in O
and O
when O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
Muslim I-NORP
world O
restrains O
their O
own O
. O

And O
what O
was O
so O
shocking O
to O
me O
about O
this O
story O
a O
Sunni B-NORP
Jihadi I-NORP
suicide O
bomber O
blows O
up O
a O
mosque O
number B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
on O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
Ramadan I-DATE
. O

What O
that O
tells O
you O
is O
that O
there O
's O
no O
controlling O
moral O
authority O
today B-DATE
in O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
Muslim I-NORP
world O
. O

Well O
what O
is O
the O
bigger O
story O
? O

And O
that O
is O
a O
huge O
story O
. O

I O
think O
it O
should O
have O
been O
a O
big O
story O
. O

Why O
was O
n't O
- O

Is O
it O
because O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
fatigue O
? O

Um O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
yeah O
. O

Think O
it O
's O
- O

Are O
all O
the O
editors O
and O
producers O
and O
new O
executives O
feeling O
another B-DATE
day I-DATE
another O
bombing O
ten B-CARDINAL
killed O
twenty B-CARDINAL
killed O
fifteen B-CARDINAL
killed O
. O

and O
it O
does O
n't O
ha- O
rise O
anymore O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
newscast O
or O
the O
front O
page O
? O

Right O
. O

Yeah O
and O
I O
think O
that O
's O
right O
. O

There O
is O
Iraq B-GPE
fatigue O
. O

And O
there O
's O
so O
much O
fatigue O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
sit O
back O
and O
say O
wait O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
. O

what O
happened O
today B-DATE
? O

A O
Sunni B-NORP
Muslim I-NORP
fundamentalist O
went O
into O
a O
mosque O
on O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
Ramadan I-DATE
their O
holiest O
day O
. O

and O
no O
one O
says O
boo O
. O

This O
is O
-- O
this O
is O
civilization O
that O
when O
we O
we O
accidentally O
or O
deliberately O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
abused O
the O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
people O
rioted O
in O
Pakistan B-GPE
. O

Yet O
their O
own O
houses O
of O
worship O
and O
holidays O
are O
being O
defiled O
. O

And O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
measure O
of O
how O
much O
we O
've O
kind O
of O
lost O
been O
numbed O
by O
all O
of O
this O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
sit O
back O
and O
say O
wow O
wait O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
. O

that O
really O
crosses O
the O
line O
. O

and O
we O
have O
to O
call O
them O
on O
it O
even O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
. O

You O
're O
recently O
back O
from O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
you O
write O
about O
driving O
in O
from O
Kuwait B-GPE
. O

You O
were O
guarded O
by O
the O
US B-GPE
navy O
. O

and O
yet O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
a O
harrowing O
experience O
. O

Why O
so O
? O

Um O
you O
know O
the O
south O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
which O
is O
where O
I O
was O
the O
area O
around O
. O

This O
is O
the O
safe O
part O
. O

Right O
exactly O
. O

I O
was O
in O
the O
safe O
district O
. O

I O
was O
guarded O
uh O
by O
the B-ORG
British I-ORG
Royal I-ORG
Marines I-ORG
actually O
because O
unfortunately O
they O
've O
had O
now O
um O
uh O
roadside O
bombs O
down O
there O
not O
suicide O
bombs O
. O

And O
it O
's O
part O
of O
the O
general O
continuing O
insecurity O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
that O
um O
I O
'm O
afraid O
has O
plagued O
this O
story O
from O
the O
very O
beginning O
. O

And O
it O
's O
been O
I O
've O
always O
felt O
the O
Achille B-PERSON
's O
heel O
. O

You O
know O
my O
my O
criticism O
of O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
as O
you O
know O
How- O
we O
've O
talked O
about O
this O
before O
is O
not O
that O
this O
war O
is O
not O
important O
. O

I O
believe O
it O
is O
important O
much O
more O
important O
than O
I O
think O
the O
left O
has O
ever O
fully O
recognized O
. O

But O
it O
's O
so O
much O
harder O
than O
the O
right O
has O
ever O
been O
willing O
to O
acknowledge O
. O

And O
on O
that O
trip O
you O
put O
on O
body O
armor O
. O

Their O
their O
rifles O
were O
out O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Um O
how O
does O
that O
affect O
your O
perception O
as O
a O
journalist O
? O

You O
're O
there O
. O

you O
're O
being O
protected O
. O

and O
you O
're O
must O
have O
been O
a O
little O
bit O
nervous O
of O
of O
what O
the O
safety O
situation O
is O
in O
there O
. O

Well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
what O
's O
really O
frustrating O
from O
a O
journalist O
's O
point O
of O
view O
as O
one O
who O
have O
lived O
in O
Beirut B-GPE
for O
nearly B-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
covered O
that O
war O
. O

When O
I O
worked O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
you O
could O
go O
anywhere O
on O
that O
story O
. O

You O
could O
cross O
lines O
. O

Journalists O
worked O
for O
the O
most O
part O
until O
the O
very O
end O
with O
Terry B-PERSON
Anderson I-PERSON
the O
kidnappings O
targets O
. O

Therefore O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
Lebanon B-GPE
story O
I O
thought O
the O
best O
journalists O
there O
knew O
more O
than O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
. O

I O
always O
thought O
the O
best O
compliment O
you O
could O
get O
as O
a O
journalist O
is O
when O
you O
told O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
something O
they O
did O
n't O
know O
because O
you O
were O
moving O
around O
so O
much O
. O

What O
's O
so O
frustrating O
about O
the O
Iraq B-GPE
story O
Howie B-PERSON
no O
one O
has O
a O
bird O
's O
eye O
view O
. O

I O
care O
passionately O
about O
this O
story O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
interested O
in O
it O
. O

but O
because O
of O
the O
securtiy O
situation O
you O
ca O
n't O
move O
around O
with O
the O
freedom O
you O
want O
. O

And O
the O
brave O
reporters O
who O
are O
there O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
do O
n't O
have O
that O
freedom O
of O
movement O
either O
. O

And O
therefore O
it O
's O
limited O
. O

and O
in O
fact O
as O
you O
know O
the O
administration O
says O
because O
of O
the O
security O
situation O
and O
maybe O
because O
of O
some O
biases O
in O
the O
media O
. O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
things O
going O
on O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
progress O
being O
made O
we O
're O
not O
seeing O
reported O
by O
the O
press O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
that O
is O
a O
credible O
argument O
at O
this O
point O
in O
the O
mess O
there O
? O

No O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
bird O
's O
eye O
view O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
say O
. O

I O
wish O
I O
could O
be O
so O
sure O
. O

but O
General O
Casey B-PERSON
does O
n't O
have O
a O
bird O
's O
eye O
view O
. O

And O
that O
's O
why O
we O
get O
surprises O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Uh O
that O
's O
why O
we O
had O
an O
election O
where O
eight B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
suddenly O
turn O
out O
. O

and O
maybe O
you O
know O
we O
're O
going O
to O
see O
more O
surpises O
in O
the O
coming O
future O
there O
. O

But O
because O
no O
one O
can O
move O
around O
with O
the O
freedom O
that O
you O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
everyone O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
bird O
's O
eye O
view O
. O

And O
as O
a O
reporter O
as O
a O
columnist O
who O
really O
cares O
about O
this O
story O
I O
find O
that O
really O
frustra- O
- O

I O
can O
not O
report O
it O
the O
way O
I O
'd O
love O
to O
. O

So O
I O
've O
been O
there O
five B-CARDINAL
times O
. O

but O
it O
's O
episodic O
. O

It O
's O
here O
. O

It O
's O
there O
. O

It O
's O
never O
really O
putting O
your O
arms O
around O
the O
story O
. O

Tak- O
pulling O
back O
the O
camera O
a O
bit O
in O
recent B-DATE
months I-DATE
you O
'd O
have O
to O
say O
that O
the O
Iraq B-GPE
story O
has O
been O
overshadowed O
by O
Katrina B-EVENT
by O
Rita B-EVENT
by O
Tom B-PERSON
DeLay I-PERSON
by O
Harriet B-PERSON
Miers I-PERSON
by O
Valerie B-PERSON
Plame I-PERSON
and O
now O
by O
this O
Pakistan B-GPE
earthquake O
. O

Um O
inevitable O
with O
a O
war O
that O
drags O
on O
and O
on O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
-- O
and O
these O
are O
all O
also O
important O
stories O
obviously O
. O

but O
uh O
do O
you O
feel O
it O
's O
getting O
the O
attention O
that O
it O
should O
? O

Yeah O
. O

No O
because O
to O
me O
this O
is O
the O
whole O
ballgame O
of O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
. O

Katrina B-EVENT
and O
Rita B-EVENT
they O
'll O
come O
and O
go O
. O

but O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
made O
a O
very O
big O
claim O
um O
that O
it O
could O
go O
to O
Iraq B-GPE
um O
and O
produce O
a O
decent O
forward O
looking O
government O
there O
. O

If O
that O
happens O
then O
I O
think O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
a O
a O
very O
huge O
quiver O
you O
know O
in O
his O
uh O
legacy O
there O
. O

Um O
if O
it O
-- O
if O
it O
does O
n't O
happen O
I O
think O
uh O
the O
administration O
will O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
complete O
and O
utter O
failure O
. O

so O
everything O
rides O
on O
this O
not O
just O
for O
the O
administration O
though O
but O
for O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
. O

These O
are O
huge O
stakes O
involved O
. O

And O
so O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
gotten O
the O
attention O
it O
's O
deserved O
. O

And O
going O
back O
again O
to O
one O
of O
your O
Iraq B-GPE
collumns O
uh O
you O
observed O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
military O
there O
which O
after O
all O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
increasingly O
shouldering O
the O
burden O
of O
this O
conflict O
. O

The O
slightly O
ragged O
quality O
left O
you O
feeling O
you O
write O
that O
if O
you O
pulled O
the O
US B-GPE
and O
British B-NORP
advisors O
out O
tomorrow B-DATE
the O
whole O
Iraqi B-NORP
navy O
would O
collapse O
. O

That O
's O
a O
pretty O
pessimistic O
assessment O
and O
clearly O
at O
odds O
with O
what O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
Defense I-ORG
Department I-ORG
say O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

. O

Not O
at O
odds O
though O
with O
what O
actually O
the O
military O
commanders O
have O
been O
saying O
which O
is O
that O
the O
number O
of O
really O
trained O
Iraqi B-NORP
units O
you O
know O
are O
far O
fewer O
than O
than O
sometimes O
suggested O
by O
the O
administration O
. O

So O
you O
're O
saying O
there O
's O
a O
gap O
between O
what O
real O
time O
military O
commanders O
on O
the O
ground O
are O
willing O
to O
tell O
you O
not O
necessarily O
on O
the O
record O
. O

You O
quoted O
one B-CARDINAL
US B-GPE
senior O
official O
and O
what O
the O
President O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
the O
Vice O
President O
and O
the O
dis- O
Secretary O
of O
Defense B-ORG
are O
saying O
to O
reporters O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

Are O
we O
calling O
them O
on O
that O
? O

Right O
d- O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
enough O
because O
there O
's O
-- O
there O
's O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
happy O
talk O
around O
this O
Howie B-PERSON
basically O
. O

And O
a O
lot O
of O
numbers O
are O
thrown O
out O
. O

Eighty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
we O
've O
got O
trained O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
twenty I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
next B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

Here O
's O
what O
you O
learn O
when O
you O
go O
to O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Where O
you O
have O
an O
Iraqi B-NORP
commander O
who O
's O
a O
real O
leader O
of O
of O
soldiers O
okay O
you O
have O
a O
unit O
. O

And O
where O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
that O
commander O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
unit O
. O

So O
the O
numbers O
the O
macro O
numbers O
do O
n't O
mean O
anything O
. O

So O
I O
went O
down O
to O
the O
-- O
to O
see O
the O
navy O
there O
. O

The O
navy O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
has O
a O
terrific O
commander O
. O

so O
the O
people O
around O
him O
they O
'll O
follow O
him O
into O
battle O
. O

But O
you O
take O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
guy O
out O
there O
's O
no O
Iraqi B-NORP
navy O
. O

and O
it O
's O
true O
of O
units O
all O
over O
the O
country O
. O

That O
's O
really O
the O
key O
. O

You O
say O
that O
you O
are O
angry O
uh O
that O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
fought O
the O
war O
as O
though O
it O
would O
be O
easy O
. O

Are O
you O
particularly O
angry O
as O
somebody O
who O
supported O
the O
war O
and O
took O
heat O
from O
some O
of O
your O
liberal O
friends O
for O
doing O
so O
? O

Yes O
. O

Absolutely O
because O
I O
believe O
this O
is O
important O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
something O
very O
big O
is O
at O
stake O
. O

We O
're O
dealing O
with O
a O
Muslim B-NORP
Arab I-NORP
civilization O
right O
now O
that O
's O
that O
's O
in O
decline O
, O
that O
's O
heading O
in O
the O
wrong O
direction O
in O
ways O
that O
are O
dangerous O
for O
them O
and O
I O
believe O
dangerous O
for O
the O
stability O
of O
the O
world O
. O

There O
's O
something O
really O
important O
here O
at O
stake O
. O

and O
what O
makes O
me O
so O
angry O
at O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
is O
not O
that O
they O
did O
n't O
frame O
the O
stakes O
. O

It O
is O
important O
. O

But O
they O
never O
never O
appreciated O
how O
difficult O
it O
was O
. O

They O
never O
prepared O
the O
army O
or O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
for O
how O
difficult O
it O
was O
. O

I O
mentioned O
the O
uh O
devastating O
earthquake O
in O
Pakistan B-GPE
a O
region O
you O
're O
familiar O
with O
. O

Um O
clearly O
it O
's O
become O
a O
pretty O
big O
story O
. O

but O
for O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
couple I-DATE
days I-DATE
I O
noticed O
it O
was O
n't O
that O
much O
of O
a O
television O
story O
. O

and O
the O
reason O
was O
no O
pictures O
no O
video O
. O

No O
yes O
. O

Um O
but O
also O
m- O
maybe O
there O
was O
there O
a O
little O
bit O
less O
coverage O
because O
it O
's O
in O
a O
remote O
part O
of O
the O
world O
? O

Uh O
Westerners B-NORP
are O
more O
interested O
in O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
than O
in O
Pakistan B-GPE
? O

I O
think O
all O
of O
the O
above O
. O

We O
're O
so O
numbed O
also O
after O
Katrina B-EVENT
and O
Rita B-EVENT
. O

and O
now O
another O
earthquake O
. O

. O

It O
's O
just O
become O
uh O
one B-CARDINAL
natural O
disaster O
after O
another O
. O

to O
hear O
ten B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
forty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
then O
it O
's O
almost O
hard O
for O
a O
journalist O
to O
process O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
it O
was O
remote O
. O

and O
people O
are O
exhausted O
I O
think O
both O
viewers O
and O
reporters O
. O

Ahead O
have O
New B-ORG

been O
asked O
not O
to O
write O
about O
Judy B-PERSON

about O

book O

Now O
your O

've O

uh O
monster O
best O

more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
copies O
better O
than O
any O
book O
you O
've O
ever O
written O
before O
. O

Um O
you O
were O
recently O
proto- O
profiled O
about O
this O
in O
Fortune B-ORG
magazine O
. O

and O
it O
uh O
pretty O
-- O
uh O
let O
's O
just O
say O
that O
it O
did O
n't O
say O
you O
walked O
on O
water O
but O
it O
came O
close O
. O

Uh O
but O
one O
of O
the O
criticisms O
- O

What O
's O
wrong O
with O
that O
? O

It O
says O
that O
you O
're O
the O
composer O
of O
the O
nation O
's O
talking O
points O
which O
was O
news O
to O
me O
. O

Uh O
one O
of O
the O
things O
it O
said O
was O
that O
uh O
in O
your O
book O
and O
in O
your O
writing O
that O
CEOs O
play O
a O
very O
central O
role O
. O

And O
the O
suggestion O
was O
well O
CEOs O
love O
you O
, O
you O
're O
asked O
to O
speak O
at O
all O
these O
corporate O
events O
, O
maybe O
because O
you O
m- O
give O
them O
a O
very O
large O
uh O
share O
of O
the O
narrative O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Mhm O
. O

Mhm O
. O

That O
a O
reasonable O
observation O
? O

Yeah O
it O
is O
a O
reasonable O
observation O
. O

And O
my O
reaction O
to O
that O
is O
look O
if O
I O
want O
to O
understand O
the O
underlying O
technology O
that O
is O
flattening O
the O
world O
who O
do O
I O
go O
to O
? O

Do O
I O
go O
to O
the O
-- O
do O
I O
go O
to O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
Central B-LOC
America I-LOC
? O

Do O
I O
go O
to O
um O
uh O
the O
factory O
floor O
? O

Or O
do O
I O
go O
to O
the O
innovators O
and O
entrepeneurs O
who O
actually O
put O
all O
this O
together O
? O

So O
I O
make O
no O
apology O
for O
that O
at O
all O
. O

Um O
fact O
I O
would O
make O
a O
criticism O
of O
it O
. O

There O
are O
n't O
enough O
people O
during O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
who O
actually O
went O
out O
and O
talked O
to O
the O
innovators O
who O
are O
doing O
all O
of O
these O
things O
who O
are O
actually O
reshaping O
the O
world O
. O

Just O
the O
opposite O
. O

We O
kind O
of O
had O
an O
Enron B-ORG
effect O
. O

and O
Enron B-ORG
effect O
was O
all O
CEOs O
are O
guilty O
unless O
proven O
innocent O
, O
therefore O
who O
wants O
to O
talk O
to O
them O
? O

And O
therefore O
I O
would O
argue O
-- O
I O
would O
argue O
-- O
. O

Wait O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
. O

wait O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
. O

Journalists O
uh O
subscribe O
to O
stereotypes O
because O
there O
are O
a O
few O
crooks O
at O
major O
corporations O
because O
you O
know O
they O
're O
all O
bad O
guys O
? O

Yeah O
yeah O
. O

Yeah O
I O
w- O
-- O
I O
would O
say O
-- O
I O
would O
say O
. O

That O
's O
a O
-- O
uh O
that O
's O
a O
harsh O
uh O
assessment O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
ignoring O
-- O
there O
's O
several O
things O
happened O
basically O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

I O
would O
call O
it O
a O
poli- O
-- O
a O
perfect O
storm O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
was O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
. O

That O
distracted O
us O
okay O
. O

The O
other O
was O
the O
Enron B-ORG
effect O
. O

You O
know O
no O
one O
wanted O
to O
be O
sort O
of O
seen O
with O
CEOs O
. O

And O
number B-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
was O
the O
dot O
com O
bust O
which O
made O
everyone O
think O
well O
all O
this O
globalization O
technology O
stuff O
is O
really O
over O
. O

And O
as O
a O
result O
I O
would O
argue O
that O
really O
masked O
what O
is O
actually O
a O
fundemental O
inflection O
point O
the O
flattening O
of O
the O
world O
that O
we O
're O
going O
from O
a O
vertical O
value O
creation O
model O
of O
command O
and O
control O
to O
a O
much O
more O
horizontal O
one O
of O
connect O
and O
collaborate O
. O

The O
argument O
of O
this O
book O
is O
that O
that O
shift O
is O
actually O
going O
to O
be O
as O
big O
-- O
have O
as O
big O
an O
effect O
over O
time O
as O
Gutenberg B-PERSON
and O
the O
printing O
press O
. O

And O
I O
would O
argue O
a O
little O
bit O
that O
it O
got O
missed O
because O
of O
all O
these O
other O
distractions O
. O

But O
it O
's O
only O
had O
an O
effect O
on O
Tom B-PERSON
Friedman I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
career O
. O

In O
fact O
you O
were O
the O
Playboy B-ORG
interview O
. O

Hey O
put O
that O
paper O
down O
. O

. O

I O
I O
bought O
it O
for O
the O
articles O
. O

Uh O
I O
enjoyed O
the O
interview O
. O

and O
you O
said O
in O
there O
that O
your O
wife O
uh O
edits O
all O
your O
columns O
and O
she O
says O
do O
n't O
publish O
it O
. O

Yes O
she O
does O
. O

You O
go O
back O
and O
rewrite O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
afraid O
I O
do O
. O

. O

My O
wife O
Andrea B-PERSON
edits O
them O
all O
. O

and O
when O
she O
says O
-- O
when O
she O
gives O
me O
thumbs O
down O
Howie B-PERSON
I O
have O
to O
put O
it O
in O
a O
ball O
throw O
it O
in O
the O
-- O
in O
the O
circular O
flo- O
file O
and O
start O
over O
. O

and O
she O
's O
a O
tough O
editor O
. O

Now O
your O
international O
readership O
on O
the O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
website O
has O
gone O
down O
because O
of O
this O
new O
experiment O
the O
Times B-ORG
has O
where O
it O
costs O
forty B-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
ninety I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
a O
year O
for O
non-subscribers O
at O
home O
to O
read O
Times B-ORG
columnists O
. O

That O
's O
got O
to O
be O
disappointing O
for O
you O
. O

You O
know O
it O
's O
-- O
um O
I O
'm O
torn O
. O

Uh O
and O
I O
've O
-- O
I O
've O
said O
this O
to O
my O
bosses O
. O

Um O
I O
want O
my O
paper O
to O
thrive O
. O

and O
if O
we O
have O
a O
situation O
where O
young O
people O
grow O
up O
in O
the O
world O
that O
thinks O
that O
newspapers O
are O
things O
you O
read O
for O
free O
online O
who O
's O
going O
to O
-- O
who O
's O
going O
to O
pay O
my O
travel O
expenses O
? O

And O
at O
the O
same O
time O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
greatest O
things O
about O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
online O
is O
I O
got O
to O
reach O
an O
audience O
that O
just O
was O
exponential O
to O
what O
you O
got O
in O
the O
dead O
tree O
edition O
of O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
. O

And O
I O
I O
partic- O
because O
I O
write O
about O
international O
affairs O
so O
I O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
young O
people O
in O
India B-GPE
and O
Egypt B-GPE
and O
whatnot O
. O

and O
for O
them O
fifty B-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
that O
may O
be O
their O
-- O
that O
may O
be O
their O
tuition O
for O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

So O
I O
I O
'm O
honestly O
torn O
. O

I O
really O
hope O
this O
works O
because O
I O
want O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
to O
have O
a O
platform O
that O
is O
sustainable O
. O

But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
I O
hope O
we O
can O
eventually O
find O
a O
way O
to O
re-engage O
those O
people O
because O
definitely O
we O
've O
lost O
some O
of O
them O
. O

Eh O
in O
the O
Valerie B-PERSON
Plame I-PERSON
leak O
investigation O
there O
's O
an O
allegation O
bouncing O
around O
the O
blogosphere O
that O
I O
just O
thought O
I O
would O
address O
with O
you O
which O
is O
that O
-- O
have O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
columnists O
somehow O
been O
told O
not O
to O
write O
about O
this O
because O
of O
Judy B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
involvement O
and O
being O
in O
jail O
, O
now O
being O
out O
of O
jail O
. O

Absol- O
absolutely O
not O
. O

Anybody O
tell O
you O
not O
to O
write O
about O
it O
? O

I O
mean O
they O
do O
n't O
tell O
me O
not O
to O
write O
about O
anything O
. O

I O
Howie O
we O
have O
the O
best O
jo- O

we O
are O
home O

okay O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
China B-GPE
on O
on O
uh O
on O
Monday B-DATE

and O
there O
's O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
person O
knows O
I O
'm O
going O
. O

and O
that O
's O
my O
assistant O
. O

So O
um O
- O

Did O
you O
even O
tell O
the O
boss O
? O

That O
's O
right O
. O
so O
there O
there O
there O
's O
no O
edict O
out O
there O
. O

Why O
why O
people O
have O
n't O
written O
about O
it O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
'm O
focused O
on O
other O
things O
. O

There O
's O
a O
lot O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
obviously O
about O
the O
Judith B-PERSON
Miller I-PERSON
situation O
. O

but O
why O
do O
you O
think O
that O
she O
has O
gotten O
so O
much O
criticism O
? O

After O
all O
whether O
you O
agree O
with O
her O
or O
not O
this O
is O
a O
woman O
who O
believed O
in O
her O
convictions O
and O
went O
off O
to O
jail O
for O
eighty B-DATE
- I-DATE
five I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

Um O
you O
know O
um O
Judy B-PERSON
's O
always O
been O
a O
pioneer O
and O
an O
agent O
of O
change O
you O
know O
um O
and O
uh O
has O
been O
at O
the O
forefront O
of O
a O
lot O
of O

and O
people O

that O
in O

engender O
a O

a O
lot O

a O

Um O
and O

the O

it O

It O

threat O
as O
noncredible O
. O

But O
the O
TV O
coverage O
kept O
rolling O
down O
the O
track O
like O
the O
number B-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
express O
. O

Finally O
last B-DATE
Tuesday I-DATE
some O
newspapers O
and O
then O
the O
cable O
networks O
reported O
that O
the O
whole O
thing O
was O
a O
hoax O
. O

The O
CBS B-ORG
evening B-TIME
news O
gave O
that O
three B-CARDINAL
sentences O
. O

Well O
Jim B-PERSON
Stewart I-PERSON
of O
our O
Washington B-GPE
bureau O
quotes O
governe- O
government O
sources O
tonight B-TIME
as O
saying O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
man O
who O
gave O
that O
tip O
to O
US B-GPE
intelligence O
agents O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
now O
says O
the O
information O
was O
simply O
not O
true O
. O

But O
that O
's O
a O
lot O
more O
than O
NBC B-ORG
Nightly I-ORG

World I-ORG
News I-ORG
Tonight I-ORG
which O
did O
n't O
mention O
the O
great O
subway O

at O
all O
. O

In O
an O
age O
of O
terror O
such O
threats O
obviously O
need O
to O
be O
reported O
. O

but O
given O
the O
unreliability O
of O
intelligence O
television O
ought O
to O
learn O
a O
lesson O
here O
about O
not O
going O
on O
high O
alert O
and O
scaring O
people O
. O

When O
we O
come O
back O
one B-CARDINAL

an O

. O

a O
hill O

and O

eight B-CARDINAL
floors O

but O
it O
does O
n't O
like O
it O

not O

high O
rise O
eight B-CARDINAL
floors O

it O
just O
kind O
of O
cascades O
down O
the O

which O
one O
did O
I O
send O
you O

is O
it O
just O
of O
the O
center O
? O

yeah O

just O
like O
an O
aerial O
aerial O
view O
. O

oh O
yeah O

okay O
so O
you O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
talking O
about O

yeah O

Anyway O

and O
so O
then O
%um O
like O
our O
room O
is O
on O
the O
floor O
fourth B-ORDINAL
floor O

mhm O
. O

and O
you O
actually O
go O
outside O
to O
get O
to O
our O
room O

there O
's O
a O
hallway O
that O
's O
outside O

and O
then O
the O
rooms O
are O
just O

I O
mean O
they O
look O
like O
little O
apartments O
you O
know O
that O
you O
get O
into O

and O
there O
's O
%um O

the O
hallway O
is O
just O
all O
done O
in O
marble O

and O
%um O
you O
know O
there O
's O
trees O
in O
the O
hallway O

and O
and O
there O
's O
ivy O
that O
grows O
on O
the O
wall O

and O
you O
come O
into O
the O
room O

uh-huh O

and O
%um O
and O
you O
know O
it O
's O
got O
our O
beds O
and O
the O
bathroom O
and O
stuff O

and O
then O
and O
then O
there O
's O
a O
patio O
where O
you O
go O
outside O

and O
there O
's O
a O
wooden O
trellis O
that O
kind O
f O
bows O
overhead O
and O
kind O
of O
makes O
a O
little O
roof O
for O
it O
for O
us O
I O
guess O

and O
it O
's O
got O
all O
of O
these O
flowering O
plants O
on O
it O
and O
ivy O

and O
and O
then O
we O
have O
this O
big O
rose O
garden O
in O
front O
of O
us O

and O
and O
then O
you O
just O
have O
this O
perfect O
view O
of O
the O
city O
. O

So O
you O
're O
actually O
above O
the O
city O

what O

yeah O

right O

we O
're O
above O
the O
city O

we O
're O
on O
mount B-LOC
Scopeth I-LOC
which O
is O
right O
next O
to O
the B-LOC
mount I-LOC
Olif I-LOC

and O
so O
%um O
Jerusalem B-GPE
is O
right O
below O
us O

it O
takes O
about B-TIME
fifteen I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
to O
walk O
-- O
Is O
-- O
into O
the O
old O
city O
. O

Is O
the O
Jerusalem B-GPE
center O
on O
the O
highest O
mountain O
for O
around O
there O
? O

%um O
it O
's O

yeah O

well O
pretty O
close O

like O
Hebrew B-ORG
University I-ORG
is O
just O
above O
us O
. O

What O
's O
it O
called O
? O

Hebrew B-ORG
University I-ORG
is O
just O
right O
above O
us O

we O
go O
there O
a O
lot O

we O
have O
access O
to O
all O
of O
their O
stuff O
%um O
their O
library O
and O
everything O
like O
that O

but O
%um O

And O
who O
who O
's O
that O
done O
by O
? O

who O

a O
University O

%um O
I O
think O
it O
is O
just O
a O
state O
university O
you O
know O

From O
Jerusalem B-GPE
%huh O
? O

yeah O

%ah O
well O

no O

I O
mean O
the O
state O
of O
Israel B-GPE

yeah O

ca- O

I O
think O
that O
's O
who O
runs O
it O

but O
%um O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
worldwide O
that O
are O
there O

%huh O

I O
'm O
sorry O

I O
'm O
like O
trying O
to O
wake O
up O

Well O
I O
thought O

I O
guess O
I O
was O
an O
hour O
off O

I O
thought O
it O
'd O
be O
just O
about O
seven B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME

and O
you O
'd O
be O
wide O
awake O
by O
now O

but O
You O
are O
now O

I O
am O
now O

we O
we O
have O
tomorrow O
off O
too O

oh O
do O
you O

what O
's O
nice O
is O
we O
have O
like O
four B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
classes O
and O
and O
then O
we O
have O
%um O
three B-DATE
days I-DATE
off O

it O
's O
weird O
though O
because O
it O
's O
Sunday B-DATE
over O
there O
now O
%huh O
? O

yeah O

it O
is O

Sunday B-DATE
night O

see O
we O
have O
our O
Sunday B-DATE
on O
Saturday B-DATE
our O
Sabbath O
on O
Saturday B-DATE

and O
so O
it O
it O
's O
so O
easy O
to O
get O
confused O
with O
days O

I O
'm O
just O
I O
forget O
what O
day O
it O
is O
because O
it O
just O
it O
just O
messes O
me O
up O
because O
Sundays O
you O
know O
we O
go O
out O
and O
go O
on O
field O
trips O
and O
everything O
like O
that O

and O

confusing O

But O

my O
Isaiah B-PERSON

our O
Old B-WORK_OF_ART
Testament I-WORK_OF_ART
class O

And O

I O
usually O

%um O
I O
'm O
that O
class O
is O
a O
lot O

actually O

a O
lot O

Surprisingly O

but O
%um O

my O
Old B-WORK_OF_ART
Testament I-WORK_OF_ART
class O

said O
Near O
Eastern O
Civilizations O

that O
's O
not O
right O

No O
that O
's O
a O
C O

so O

what O
is O
it O

Studies O
Near O
Eastern O
Studies O

Near O
Eastern O
Studies O

that O
's O
what O
it O
is O

okay O
you O
'll O
have O
to O
give O
me O
a O
break O
because O
I O
'm O
a O
little O
tired O

Anyway O
%um O
that O
's O
a O
really O
cool O
class O
because O
they O
you O
get O
to O
learn O
all O
the O
history O
behind O
everything O

And O
it O
starts O
making O
things O
in O
the O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
make O
sense O
you O
know O

oh O
yeah O

you O
know O
you O
find O
out O

oh O
okay O
I O
understand O
you O
know O
okay O
when O
this O
happened O
when O
Abraham B-PERSON
was O
journeying O
and O
What O
was O
going O
on O
politically O
in O
the O
area O
what O
was O
going O
on O
culturally O
in O
the O
area O

and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
the O
stories O
kind O
of O
make O
sense O

And O
it O
just O
they O
just O
come O
to O
life O
you O
know O

it O
's O
really O
neat O

I O
like O
it O
a O
lot O

and O
then O
I O
have O
%um O
then O
I O
have O
%um O
my O
Jewish B-NORP
Culture O
class O
%um O
taught O
by O
rabbi O
Rosen B-PERSON

he O
's O
really O
really O
good O
really O
good O
teacher O
%um O

and O
%ah O
tha- O
that O
's O
been O
interesting O
to O
to O
learn O
about O

yeah O

Does O
he O
speak O
English B-LANGUAGE
pretty O
well O

yeah O

actually O
he O
's O
British B-NORP

and O
he O
speaks O
with O
this O
really O
cool O
British B-NORP
accent O

I O
love O
listening O
to O
him O
talk O

he O
uses O
all O
of O
these O
%um O
cool O
words O

and O
in O
his O
British B-NORP
accident O
accent O
it O
just O
it O
just O
kind O
of O
sounds O
kind O
of O
neat O

he O
's O
an O
he O
's O
a O
neat O
figure O

he O
's O
really O
%um O
energetic O

and O
anyway O
%um O
he O
%ah O

and O
then O
there O
's O
this O
Arab B-NORP
Civilization O
class O
that O
I O
take O
from O
%um O
from O
Brother O

he O
's O
an O
Arab B-NORP
here O
a O
very O
prominent O
Arab B-NORP
%um O
Muslim B-NORP
down O
here O

he O
really O
was O
influential O
in O
%um O
getting O
the O
center O
built O
here O

he O
worked O
with O
President O
Hunter B-PERSON
a O
lot O
that O
knew O
him O
very O
well O

he O
is O
so O
neat O

and O
I O
wrote O
I O
wrote O
this O
in O
my O
letter O
so O
you O
'll O
get O
it O
twice O

but O
%um O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
us O
one O
time O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
our O
classes O

and O
he O
was O
saying O
%um O
somebody O
asked O
him O

he O
's O
known O
as O
a O
dry O
Mormon B-NORP
down O
here O

and O
so O
somebody O
asked O
him O
kind O
of O
what O
that O
meant O

and O
and O
he O
said O
he O
just O
started O

he O
kind O
of O
laughed O

and O
he O
started O
going O
on O
about O
how O
he O
first O
came O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
church O
and O
President O
Hunter B-PERSON

and O
and O
%uh O
he O
said O

and O
he O
just O
started O
getting O
all O
he O
got O
all O
choked O
up O
you O
know O
and O
started O
to O
cry O

and O
%ah O
he O
you O
know O
had O
to O
stop O
and O
kind O
of O
excuse O
himself O

but O
he O
said O
%um O
he O
said O
that O
he O
said O
that O
he O
always O
felt O
like O
in O
Islam B-NORP
they O
believe O
that O
Mohammed B-PERSON
was O
a O
prophet O
%hm O
And O
they O
believe O
in O
all O
the O
other O
prophets O
that O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Old I-WORK_OF_ART
Testament I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
New I-WORK_OF_ART
Testament I-WORK_OF_ART
you O
know O
that O
Jesus B-PERSON
was O
a O
prophet O

an- O

anyway O

but O
they O
believe O
that O
Mohammed B-PERSON
was O
the O
last O
prophet O
you O
know O

and O
so O
he O
was O
the O
seal O
of O
the O
prophet O

they O
do O
n't O
worship O
em O
him O
or O
anything O

and O
it O
's O
funny O
because O
I O
learn O
about O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
religion O
and O
it O
's O
the O
same O
thing O

you O
see O
all O
of O
these O
divisions O
happening O
and O
all O
of O
these O
questions O

and O
you O
ask O

you O
know O
there O
's O
the O
old O
joke O
%um O
if O
you O
ask O
%ah O
three B-CARDINAL
Jewish B-NORP
men O
a O
question O
you O
'll O
get O
four B-CARDINAL
opinions O

You O
know O
tha- O

I O
mean O
they O
're O
just O
they O
're O
very O
you O
know O

you O
you O
really O
do O

I O
've O
talked O
to O
several O
of O
them O

you O
really O
get O
different O
things O
because O
you O
know O
there O
's O
the O
ultra O
orthodox O
and O
the O
reformed O
and O
the O
anyway O
%um O

and O
so O
he O
was O
just O
saying O
that O
%ah O
he O
never O
thought O
that O
that O
was O
right O

and O
he O
said O
when O
I O
%um O
whenever O
I O
am O
with O
your O
prophet O
President O
Hunter B-PERSON
I O
he O
says O
I O
can O
not O
explain O
it O

it O
's O
just O
a O
feeling O
inside O

and O
then O
he O
'd O
say O
do O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O

and O
we O
were O
all O
just O
silent O
you O
know O
and O
and O
just O
nodding O
our O
heads O

and O
he O
says O
yup O
he O
says O
I O
just O
can O
not O
help O
but O
feel O
that O
that O
this O
is O
a O
man O
of O
God O

, O
another O
Taiwanese B-NORP

passed O

. O

I O
had O
never O

of O
her O
. O

I O
hear O
she O
was O
a O
talented O
beauty O
. O

What O
a O
great O
pity O
! O

The O
accident O
was O
a O
car O
crash O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
entertainment O
news O
denounced O
that O
+her O
car O
's O
front O
airbag O
failed O
to O
release O
, O
which O
caused O
the O
death O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the B-PRODUCT
MINI I-PRODUCT
COOPER I-PRODUCT
she O
was O
riding O
in O
is O
not O
what O
the O
reports O
said O
. O

It O
is O
the O
car O
with O
the O
highest O
safety O
index O
. O

It O
is O
sold O
for O
190,000 B-MONEY
HK I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
in O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
. O

Polo B-PRODUCT
also O
sells O
for O
more O
than O
140,000 B-MONEY
HK I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
cute O
little O
car O
, O
preferred O
by O
girls O
. O

But O
safety O
is O
surely O
not O
too O
big O
of O
a O
problem O
. O

The O
collision O
happened O
on O
the O
side O
and O
rear O
. O

So O
, O
the O
side O
airbag O
and O
air O
curtain O
were O
fully O
opened O
. O

They O
opened O
at O
the O
time O
of O
first B-ORDINAL
collision O
with O
the O
protective O
fence O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
collision O
was O
with O
the O
protective O
fence O
only O
, O
and O
the O
impact O
on O
the O
people O
was O
very O
small O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
was O
the O
protection O
of O
the O
air O
curtain O
. O

So O
, O
there O
would O
surely O
not O
be O
a O
big O
problem O
. O

The O
real O
fatal O
collision O
was O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
one O
from O
the O
tailgating O
truck O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
all O
the O
airbags O
were O
already O
deflated O
. O

There O
was O
no O
protective O
effect O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
force O
of O
this O
one O
was O
extremely O
large O
. O

If O
the O
car O
had O
been O
stopped O
at O
an O
angle O
, O
then O
the O
head O
of O
the O
person O
sitting O
on O
one O
side O
would O
surely O
have O
hit O
the O
glass O
or O
the O
B O
column O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
there O
would O
not O
have O
been O
too O
much O
of O
a O
problem O
for O
someone O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

This O
is O
common O
knowledge O
. O

Then O
it O
came O
down O
to O
who O
had O
the O
bad O
luck O
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
car O
that O
was O
angled O
out O
. O

It O
was O
perfectly O
correct O
for O
the O
front O
airbag O
not O
to O
open O
, O
because O
the O
front O
of O
the O
car O
was O
not O
damaged O
at O
all O
. O

None O
of O
the O
sensors O
received O
any O
signal O
of O
a O
collision O
. O

Just O
imagine O
, O
this O
was O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

The O
people O
went O
backward O
abruptly O
. O

Their O
bodies O
could O
have O
been O
supported O
by O
the O
seats O
, O
but O
the O
impact O
on O
their O
necks O
and O
heads O
was O
tremendous O
. O

When O
they O
went O
abruptly O
backward O
, O
any O
additional O
misfortune O
of O
the O
front O
airbag O
opening O
for O
no O
reason O
would O
have O
eliminated O
any O
chance O
of O
survival O
. O

So O
, O
of O
all O
the O
cars O
in O
the O
world O
, O
even O
a O
Rolls B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
Royce I-PRODUCT
, O
the O
front O
airbag O
will O
not O
open O
during O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

If O
the O
front O
airbag O
opened O
after O
being O
tailgated O
, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
quality O
problem O
, O
and O
would O
be O
extremely O
dangerous O
. O

The O
safety O
airbag O
's O
eruption O
could O
knock O
someone O
to O
death O
. O

So O
, O
infants O
are O
strictly O
forbidden O
from O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
seat O
. O

That O
was O
how O
the O
whole O
accident O
took O
place O
. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
accident O
investigation O
division O
will O
not O
be O
different O
from O
this O
. O

For O
this O
kind O
of O
accident O
, O
conclusions O
can O
be O
drawn O
from O
a O
single O
glance O
at O
the O
car O
wreckage O
. O

The O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
have O
no O
fault O
. O

All O
of O
the O
car O
's O
passive O
safety O
protections O
had O
already O
fully O
carried O
out O
their O
functions O
. O

So O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
ridiculous O
and O
unscientific O
to O
blame O
and O
suspect O
the O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
for O
such O
an O
accident O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
speculation O
about O
why O
the O
front O
airbags O
did O
not O
open O
was O
very O
amateurish O
. O

Only O
by O
not O
opening O
would O
it O
have O
been O
correct O
. O

If O
they O
had O
opened O
, O
her O
assistant O
might O
still O
be O
lying O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O

If O
an O
accident O
occurs O
on O
the O
freeway O
, O
please O
get O
out O
of O
the O
car O
and O
leave O
immediately O
if O
you O
can O
move O
. O

Many O
freeway O
accidents O
occur O
simply O
because O
people O
stay O
inside O
the O
car O
and O
sort O
out O
their O
thoughts O
, O
following O
which O
there O
is O
a O
fatal O
crash O
from O
a O
car O
following O
behind O
. O

About O
death O
, O
I O
have O
always O
believed O
that O
they O
do O
not O
leave O
the O
world O
. O

They O
only O
leave O
the O
human O
world O
. O

They O
are O
surely O
sharing O
the O
same O
world O
with O
us O
, O
with O
a O
different O
manifestation O
of O
life O
. O

-- O

It O
is O
in O
change O
that O
we O
find O
purpose O
. O

William B-PERSON
Kaiser I-PERSON
, O
president O
of O
the B-ORG
Kaiser I-ORG
Financial I-ORG
Group I-ORG
in O
Chicago B-GPE
, O
said O
the O
decline O
was O
almost O
certainly O
influenced O
by O
the O
early B-DATE
sell O
- O
off O
in O
the O
stock O
market O
, O
which O
partly O
reflected O
a O
weakening O
economy O
. O

He O
said O
the O
recent O
decline O
in O
copper O
stocks O
was O
misleading O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
slowdown O
in O
manufacturing O
. O

Mr. O
Kaiser B-PERSON
said O
traders O
could O
have O
picked O
up O
signals O
of O
an O
imminent O
price O
decline O
had O
they O
been O
watching O
the O
scrap O
metal O
markets O
, O
which O
became O
noticeably O
weaker O
two B-DATE
to I-DATE
three I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

But O
though O
a O
weakening O
economy O
implies O
reduced O
demand O
, O
Mr. O
Kaiser B-PERSON
said O
that O
Third O
World O
copper O
- O
producing O
countries O
have O
n't O
any O
choice O
but O
to O
sell O
copper O
. O

They O
might O
even O
step O
up O
sales O
in O
a O
falling O
market O
, O
he O
said O
, O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
maintain O
the O
flow O
of O
foreign O
exchange O
into O
their O
treasuries O
. O

Technically O
, O
Mr. O
Kaiser B-PERSON
noted O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
traders O
had O
bought O
into O
the O
market O
when O
the O
price O
was O
in O
the O
$ B-MONEY
1.24 I-MONEY
to I-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
1.26 I-MONEY
range O
, O
thinking O
there O
was O
support O
at O
the O
$ O
1.20 B-MONEY
level O
. O

When O
the O
market O
fell O
below O
that O
level O
on O
Monday B-DATE
and O
then O
yesterday B-DATE
could O
n't O
climb O
above O
that O
level O
, O
traders O
started O
selling O
out O
their O
positions O
. O

Betty B-PERSON

senior O
metals O

at O
Prudential B-ORG

Bache I-ORG
Securities I-ORG
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
agreed O
that O
most O
of O
the O
selling O
was O
of O
a O
technical O
nature O
. O

She O
said O
the O
market O
hit O
the O
$ O
1.18 B-MONEY
level O
at O
around O
10 B-TIME
a.m. I-TIME
EDT I-TIME
where O
it O
encountered O
a O
large O
number O
of O
stop O

loss O
orders O
. O

More O
stop O

loss O
orders O
were O
touched O
off O
all O
the O
way O
down O
to O
below O
$ O
1.14 B-MONEY
, O
where O
modest O
buying O
was O
attracted O
. O

Ms. O
Raptopoulos B-PERSON
said O
the O
settling O
of O
strikes O
in O
Canada B-GPE
and O
Mexico B-GPE
will O
have O
little O
effect O
on O
supplies O
of O
copper O
until O
early B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

She O
thinks O
the O
next O
area O
of O
support O
for O
copper O
is O
in O
the O
$ O
1.09 B-MONEY
to O
$ O
1.10 B-MONEY
range O
. O

`` O
I O
believe O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
selling O
abates O
somewhat O
we O
could O
see O
a O
rally O
back O
to O
the O
$ O
1.20 B-MONEY
region O
, O
'' O
she O
added O
. O

She O
thinks O
a O
recovery O
in O
the O
stock O
market O
would O
help O
copper O
rebound O
as O
well O
. O

She O
noted O
that O
the O
preliminary O
estimate O
of O
the O
third B-DATE
- I-DATE
quarter I-DATE
gross O
national O
product O
is O
due O
out O
tomorrow B-DATE
and O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
up O
about B-PERCENT
2.5 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
to I-PERCENT
3 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

`` O
If O
the O
number O
is O
a O
little O
better O
, O
then O
copper O
will O
respond O
positively O
, O
if O
it O
is O
worse O
then O
more O
selling O
could O
ensue O
, O
'' O
she O
predicted O
. O

Ms. O
Raptopoulos B-PERSON
noted O
that O
relating O
economic O
numbers O
to O
specific O
market O
activity O
is O
tricky O
. O

Yesterday B-DATE
, O
for O
example O
, O
`` O
the O
durable O
goods O
numbers O
came O
out O
for O
September B-DATE
and O
the O
number O
was O
down O
only B-PERCENT
0.1 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
'' O
she O
said O
. O

`` O
However O
, O
if O
you O
exclude O
defense O

related O
orders O
then O
durable O
goods O
were O
down O
3.9 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

I O
believe O
that O
number O
reflects O
a O
slowing O

. O
'' O

She O
said O
copper O

will O
also O
be O
looking O
toward O
the O
release O
of O

However O

, O
president O
of O
Threlkeld B-ORG

Co. I-ORG
, O
an O

, O
noted O
that O
so O
far O
this O
year B-DATE
copper O
consumption O
is O
way O
ahead O
of O
the O
same O
period O
of O
1988 B-DATE
, O
and O
that O
projected O
production O
is O
below O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Mr. O
Threlkeld B-PERSON
said O
the O
copper O
market O
seems O
to O
be O
anticipating O
a O
recession O
in O
three B-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
with O
declining O
use O
being O
the O
result O
. O

`` O
But O
, O
'' O
he O
added O
, O
`` O
we O
have O
had O
that O
exact O
same O
perception O
six B-CARDINAL
times O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE

. O
'' O

He O
noted O
that O
currently O
the O
ratio O
of O
available O
copper O
to O
consumption O
is O
about B-DATE
3.5 I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

He O
said O
the O
normal O
ratio O
is O
five B-DATE
to I-DATE
six I-DATE

. O

According O
to O
Mr. O
Threlkeld B-PERSON
, O
the O
bottleneck O
in O
copper O
production O
is O
n't O
at O
the O
mines O
but O
at O
the O
copper O
refineries O
. O

`` O
It O
takes O
three B-DATE
months I-DATE
to O
turn O
copper O
concentrate O
into O
cathodes O
, O
'' O
he O
said O

If O
there O
is O

a O

he O

, O
`` O
we O
will O
be O

If O
there O
is O
a O

that O
will O
change O
the O
statistical O
situation O

'' O

He O
thinks O
that O
without O

Ms. O

we O

The B-ORG

plans O
to O
extend O
its O
moratorium O
on O
federal O
funding O
of O
research O
involving O
fetal O

. O

Medical O
researchers O
believe O
the O
transplantation O
of O
small O
amounts O
of O
fetal O
tissue O
into O
humans O
could O
help O
treat O
juvenile O
diabetes O
and O
such O
degenerative O
diseases O
as O
Alzheimer O
's O
, O
Parkinson O
's O
and O
Huntington O
's O
. O

But O
anti-abortionists O
oppose O
such O
research O
because O
they O
worry O
that O
the O
development O
of O
therapies O
using O
fetal O
- O
tissue O
transplants O
could O
lead O
to O
an O
increase O
in O

Both O
Dr. O

President O

The O

began O
in O
1987 B-DATE
when O
the B-ORG

Institutes I-ORG
of I-ORG
Health I-ORG
, O
aware O
of O
the O
policy O

of O

, O
asked O
for O
an O
HHS B-ORG
review O
of O
its O
plan O
to O
implant O
fetal O
tissue O
into O
the O
brain O
of O
a O

suffering O
from O
Parkinson O

The O

placed O
a O
moratorium O
on O
the O

, O
pending O
a O
review O
of O
scientific O
, O
legal O

ethical O
issues O
. O

A O
majority O
of O
an O
NIH B-ORG

appointed O
panel O
recommended O
late B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
that O
the O
research O
continue O
under O
carefully O
controlled O
conditions O
, O
but O
the O
issue O
became O
embroiled O
in O
politics O
as O
anti-abortion O
groups O
continued O
to O
oppose O
federal O
funding O
. O

The O
dispute O
has O
hampered O
the O

efforts O
to O
recruit O
prominent O

Several O

asked O
them O
for O
their O
views O
on O

Antonio B-PERSON
Novello I-PERSON
, O
whom O
Mr. O

nominated O
to O
serve O
as O

reportedly O

Some O

have O
charged O
that O
the O

is O
imposing O
new O
ideological O
tests O
for O

scientific O
posts O
. O

Earlier B-DATE
this I-DATE

, O
Dr. O
Sullivan B-PERSON
tried O
to O
defuse O
these O
charges O
by O
stressing O
that O
candidates O
to O
head O
the O
NIH B-ORG
and O
the O
CDC B-ORG
will O
be O
judged O
by O
`` O
standards O
of O
scientific O
and O
administrative O
excellence O
, O
'' O
not O
politics O
. O

But O
the O
administration O
's O
handling O
of O
the O
fetal O
- O
tissue O
transplant O
issue O
disturbs O
many O
scientists O
. O

`` O
When O
scientific O
progress O
moves O
into O
uncharted O

, O
there O
has O
to O
be O
a O

'' O
says O
Myron B-PERSON
Genel I-PERSON
, O
associate O
dean O
of O
the B-ORG
Yale I-ORG
Medical I-ORG
School I-ORG
. O

`` O
The O
disturbing O
thing O
about O
this O

issue O
is O
that O
the O

has O
become O
polarized O

that O
no O
mechanism O
exists O

for O

But O
Dr. O
Genel B-PERSON
warns O
that O
Dr. O
Mason B-PERSON

ruling O
may O
discourage O
private O

`` O
The O
unavailability O
of O

and O
the O

in O

the O

The O
anti-Wal-Mart B-ORG

as O

that O

The O

most O
of O

from O
outside O

in O

but O
by O

the O

to O

is O

How O
much O
does O

depend O
on O
China B-GPE
? O

Company O

that O

from O

I O
think O
Wal B-ORG

is O
a O
straw O
man O
for O
a O
set O
of O
issues O
that O
a O
certain O

of O

have O
to O
deal O
with O
in O

Now O
this O
is O
important O
. O

Officials O

Also O
Galloway B-PERSON

that O

In O

Wal B-ORG

has O
no O

to O

carry O

Kyra B-PERSON
? O

Well O
whatever O
it O
does O
Wal B-ORG

Mart I-ORG
always O
seems O
to O
be O
under O
a O
microscope O
. O

Why O
? O

Because O
a O
company O
that O
big O
that O
profitable O
is O
often O
imitated O
by O
other O
companies O
and O
that O
may O
well O
affect O

. O

Take O

A O

how O

may O
be O
willing O
to O
go O
to O
keep O

. O

The O
question O
is O
will O
other O

follow O

and O
how O
might O
that O
affect O
you O
. O

. O

to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
how O

shaping O

life O
. O

I O
think O
that O
Wal B-ORG

today B-DATE
as O
we O
speak O
is O
attempting O
to O
change O
w- O
uh O
health O

for O
the O
American B-NORP
worker O
to O
the O
worse O
. O

And O
you O
're O
saying O
that O
affects O
all O
of O
us O
whether O
or O
not O
we O
work O
for O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
. O

When O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
makes O
a O
change O
in O
the O
way O
they O
do O
their O
business O
um O
then O
other O
businesses O
follow O
. O

Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
told O
us O
in O
a O
written O
statement O
it O
is O
expanding O
and O
improving O
its O
health O
insurance O
program O
. O

but O
it O
adds O
every O
business O
is O
asking O
the O
question O
how O
do O
we O
balance O
the O
genuine O
desire O
to O
provide O
the O
best O
benefits O
while O
remaining O
competitive O
in O
the O
global O
economy O
? O

That O
's O
the O
catch O
. O

The B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
is O
a O
rarity O
among O
nations O
in O
firmly O
tying O
health O
insurance O
to O
jobs O
making O
it O
a O
cost O
of O
doing O
business O
. O

So O
how O
did O
it O
get O
that O
way O
? O

Blame O
it O
on O
World B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
Two I-EVENT
when O
fear O
of O
inflation O
prompted O
President O
Roosevelt B-PERSON
to O
freeze O
wages O
. O

With O
so O
many O
Americans B-NORP
going O
to O
battle O
businesses O
were O
frantic O
for O
workers O
. O

So O
instead O
of O
more O
money O
they O
offered O
health O
insurance O
. O

Healthy O
employees O
are O
undeniably O
better O
for O
business O
better O
for O
society O
. O

but O
is O
that O
Wal B-ORG

Mart I-ORG
's I-ORG
responsibility O
? O

Look O
. O

this O
is O
a O
private O
company O
. O

What O
business O
is O
it O
of O
yours O
how O
they O
do O
their O
business O
? O

We O
the O
taxpayers O
are O
paying O
for O
Wal B-ORG

Mart I-ORG
to O
profit O
. O

um O
and O
and O
and O
so O
therefore O
therefore O
we O
have O
a O
say O
. O

And O
you O
believe O
that O
gives O
you O
a O
say O
. O

We O
're O

We O
're O

in O

A O

George B-PERSON

I O
do O

think O
that O

either O
has O
built O
an O
acceptable O
system O
for O

and O
they O
have O

on O
how O
we O

uh O
as O

The O

over O
how O

what O

it O

's O
trying O

and O
it O
's O
a O

But O
when O

That O

Y- O
you O

You O
know O
the O
Waltons B-PERSON
. O

At O
what O
level O
will O
this O
affect O
them O
? O

They O
're O
about O
to O
get O

with O
a O
whole O

of O

. O

Well O
you O
know O
in O
some O
senses O
Rick B-PERSON
they O
're O
used O
to O
it O
by O
now O
. O

I O
mean O
this O
is O
a O
company O
that O
's O
come O
under O
attack O
for O
really O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
ten I-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
a O
big O
way O
from O

from O

in O

from O

in O

. O

But O
this O
time O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
in O
churches O
. O

it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
in O
small O
gathering O
places O
in O
middle O
America B-GPE
with O
people O
saying O
some O
pretty O
horrible O
things O
I- O
- O

Do O
n't O
your O
feelings O
get O
hurt O
. O

or O
are O
they O
at O
a O
different O
level O
if O
your O
employees O
come O
out O
and O
say O
I O
ca O
n't O
feed O
my O
kids O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
making O
enough O
money O
. O

you O
're O
not O
giving O
me O
enough O
benefits O
. O

you O
're O
-- O
you O
're O
not O
paying O
me O
for O
my O
overtime O
work O
. O

Well O
I O
think O
the O
Walton B-PERSON
family O
does O
take O
it O
personally O
. O

I O
mean O
their O
name O
is O
on O
the O
door O
. O

Their O
father O
Sam B-PERSON
Walton I-PERSON
started O
this O
company O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
bad O
publicity O
. O

but O
they O
also O
feel O
wronged O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
believe O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
charges O
are O
true O
. O

and O
they O
are O
really O
starting O
to O
fight O
back O
. O

And O
we O
're O
seeing O
articles O
describing O
how O
they O
've O
really O
rallied O
and O
brought O
tremendous O
efforts O
to O
bear O
opening O
up O
offices O
in O
Washington B-GPE
and O
state O
capitals O
. O

They O
have O
a O
war O
room O
where O
they O
review O
all O
the O
criticism O
. O

and O
they O
try O
to O
respond O
now O
. O

But O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
this O
as O
I O
'm O
sure O
people O
at O
home O
are O
th- O
sitting O
there O
thinking O
right O
now O
about O
their O
own O
job O
. O

if O
W- O
if O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
is O
right O
and O
their O
model O
is O
right O
is O
this O
the O
way O
we O
're O
going O
to O
go O
? O

Will O
other O
workers O
feel O
like O
perhaps O
their O
compensation O
packages O
their O
wages O
are O
going O
to O
be O
perhaps O
either O
trimmed O
down O
or O
worse O
as O
they O
allude O
to O
in O
this O
documentary O
? O

Well O
you O
're O
talking O
about O
a O
race O
to O
the O
bottom O
in O
terms O
of O
compensation O
and O
benefits O
for O
American B-NORP
workers O
. O

And O
you O
're O
seeing O
this O
happening O
at O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
. O

but O
you O
're O
also O
seeing O
this O
happen O
at O
big O
manufacturing O
companies O
. O

Do O
n't O
forget O
people O
at O
Delta B-ORG
people O
at O
GM B-ORG
people O
at O
Delphi B-ORG
are O
getting O
their O
wages O
and O
salaries O
cut O
too O
and O
that O
does O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
. O

Having O
said O
that O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
is O
the O
biggest O
employer O
in O
the O
country O
. O

so O
they O
're O
sort O
of O
the O
benchmark O
company O
the O
company O
that O
other O
companies O
look O
to O
like O
GM B-ORG
in O
the O
past O
and O
like O
a B-ORG
US I-ORG
Steel I-ORG
. O

So O
I O
think O
other O
companies O
are O
looking O
at O
what O
Wal- O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
is O
doing O
and O
saying O
you O
know O
, O
what O
is O
the O
new O
wage O
and O
pay O
scale O
in O
this O
country O
? O

But O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
is O
really O
the O
king O
of O
the O
bottom O
line O
, O
are O
n't O
they O
? O

They O
are O
. O

They O
really O
know O
how O
to O
make O
things O
out O
of O
nothing O
. O

and O
the O
person O
who O
's O
really O
benefiting O
is O
the O
consumer O
who O
goes O
in O
there O
and O
gets O
a O
a O
sweater O
for O
for O
for O
four B-MONEY
bucks I-MONEY
. O

Well O
tha- O
and O
that O
's O
what O
they O
say O
Rick B-PERSON
. O

I O
mean O
one B-CARDINAL
point I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
Americans B-NORP
work O
at O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
like O
working O
there O
. O

We O
have O
to O
remember O
that O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
not O
all O
these O
people O
who O
work O
there O
are O
unhappy O
. O

That O
's O
number B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
. O

Number B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
the O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
Mart I-ORG
people O
say O
look O
. O

we O
're O
paying O
people O
a O
hun- O
one B-CARDINAL
point I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
Americans B-NORP
. O

but O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
millions I-CARDINAL
of O
Americans B-NORP
are O
benefiting O
from O
low O

. O

They O
're O
able O
to O
buy O
a O
VCR O
they O
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
because O
we O
're O
keeping O
our O
costs O
low O
. O

That O
's O
their O
response O
. O

If O
their O
message O
is O
right O
why O
are O
n't O
they O
putting O
one O
of O
their O
big O
kahunas O
out O
there O
to O
talk O
to O
Rick B-PERSON
Sanchez I-PERSON
to O
talk O
to O
Andy B-PERSON
and O
say O
look O
, O
this O
is O
all O
wrong O
? O

Right O
now O
they O
're O
not O
talking O
. O

They O
're O
-- O
they O
're O
not O
willing O
to O
go O
on O
camera O
. O

Well O
they O
're O
just O
starting O
to O
. O

You O
have O
to O
remember O
this O
company O
was O
a O
very O
closed O
uh O
culture O
really O
s- O
founded O
by O
Sam B-PERSON
Walton I-PERSON
. O

He O
passed O
away O
in O
nineteen B-DATE
ninety I-DATE
- I-DATE
two I-DATE
. O

He O
did O
n't O
believe O
in O
talking O
to O
the O
press O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
believe O
in O
PR O
. O

He O
said O
all O
we O
need O
to O
do O
was O
open O
stores O
up O
and O
offer O
goods O
at O
low O
prices O
. O

They O
're O
starting O
to O
realize O
that O
they O
need O
to O
respond O
more O
and O
more O
. O

So O
they O
're O
just O
getting O
up O
to O
speed O
. O

but O
I O
think O
you O
're O
right O
. O

They O
should O
get O
out O
there O
and O
tell O
their O
side O
of O
the O
story O
. O

Is O
this O
going O
to O
be O
a O
big O
hit O
for O
them O
? O

No O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
big O
hit O
because O
there O
're O
other O
things O
out O
there O
. O

You O
know O
there O

a O
negative O

There O

maybe O

out O
there O

They O

be O
a O
problem O
to O
some O
people O
if O
they O
were O

so O
successful O

Kyra B-PERSON
? O

Well O
for O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
two I-DATE
months I-DATE
we O
've O
seen O
the O
havoc O
that O
Mother O
Nature O
can O
cause O
. O

We O
've O
watched O
from O
our O
homes O
Katrina B-EVENT
's O
destructive O
force O
and O
people O
struggling O
in O
its O
aftermath O
. O

Even O
now O
it O
's O
impossible O
to O
grasp O
the O
tragedy O
along O
the B-LOC
Gulf I-LOC
Coast I-LOC
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
parts O
to O
it O
. O

So O
tonight B-TIME
CNN B-ORG

Dan B-PERSON
Simon I-PERSON
shows O
us O
a O
different O
angle O
a O
new O
divide O
forming O
in O
the B-GPE
Big I-GPE
Easy I-GPE
. O

It O
was O
the O
best O
of O
times O
. O

it O
was O
the O
worst O
of O
times O
. O

the O
famous O
words O
of O
Charles B-PERSON
Dickens I-PERSON
in O
A B-WORK_OF_ART
Tale I-WORK_OF_ART
of I-WORK_OF_ART
Two I-WORK_OF_ART
Cities I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Here O
in O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
that O
nineteenth B-DATE
century I-DATE
text O
resonates O
as O
it O
feels O
literally O
like O
two B-CARDINAL
cities O
have O
emerged O
since O
Hurricane B-EVENT
Katrina I-EVENT
one B-CARDINAL
filled O
with O
anger O
and O
desperation O
- O

Nobody O
's O
trying O
to O
help O
. O

Nobody O
's O
trying O
to O
do O
nothing O
. O

But O
here O
across O
the O
river O
on O
what O
locals O
call O
the B-LOC
West I-LOC
Bank I-LOC
they O
have O
different O
problems O
the O
kind O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
having O
like O
where O
to O
get O
coffee O
or O
go O
shopping O
. O

Here O
it O
's O
about O
progress O
and O
optimism O
. O

The O
biggest O
complaint O
we O
have O
is O
we O
never O
know O
when O
the O
garbage O
is O
being O
picked O
up O
. O

Big O
deal O
right O
? O

Yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
you O
know O
so O
it O
's O
all O
relative O
. O

Don B-PERSON
and O
Joy B-PERSON
Paolo I-PERSON
live O
across O
the O
river O
from O
the O
devastation O
in O
a O
place O
called O
Algiers B-LOC
Point I-LOC
. O

We O
found O
the O
retired O
couple O
relaxing O
on O
their O
porch O
. O

Play O
on O
words O
. O

this O
is O
the B-LOC
West I-LOC
Bank I-LOC
. O

but O
people O
here O
call O
it O
the O
blessed O
bank O
. O

The O
Paolos B-PERSON
bounced O
back O
quickly O
after O
evacuating O
to O
Ohio B-GPE
. O

While O
they O
came O
back O
to O
mold O
and O
a O
busted O
heater O
their O
problems O
seem O
miniscule O
. O

One O
of O
the O
biggest O
problems O
we O
have O
over O
here O
truthfully O
is O
traffic O
. O

There O
is O
no O
traffic O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
town O
. O

This O
is O
the O
devastated O
Lower B-LOC
Ninth I-LOC
Ward I-LOC
. O

Restaurants O
gas O
stations O
closed O
. O

neighborhoods O
vacant O
filled O
with O
trash O
. O

Contrast O
that O
with O
Algiers B-LOC
where O
carved O
pumpkins O
dot O
the O
landscape O
and O
most O
of O
the O
stores O
even O
little O
cafes O
are O
open O
for O
business O
. O

We O
just O
isolated O
. O

We O
like O
on O
a O
island O
over O
here O
. O

We O
isolated O
from O
the O
whole O
city O
. O

her O

the O

a O

clearing O

she O

on O
her O

I O
am O
very O
very O
very O
disgusted O

this O

Who O
are O
you O
disgusted O
with O
? O

The O
governor O
and O
the O
mayor O
and O
FEMA B-ORG
and O
all O
of O
them O
. O

You O
feel O
like O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
care O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
they O
do O
not O
care O
. O

Government O
officials O
say O
they O
do O
care O
. O

but O
the O
magnitude O
of O
destruction O
makes O
rebuilding O
very O
difficult O
. O

There O
's O
no O
drinkable O
water O
and O
little O
if O
any O
electricity O
here O
and O
no O
plan O
yet O
for O
restoring O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
giving O
this O
house O
away O
. O

If O
somebody O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
rebuild O
down O
here O
somebody O
need O
to O
see O
me O
about O
this O
house O
because O
I O
'm O
not O
giving O
it O
to O
nobody O

American B-WORK_OF_ART
Morning I-WORK_OF_ART
anchor O
Miles B-PERSON
O'Brien I-PERSON
was O
with O
Kim B-PERSON
today B-DATE
as O
she O
got O
some O
expert O
opinions O
on O
the O
damage O
to O
her O
home O
. O

This O
room O
was O
an O
addition O
to O
the O
house O
. O

It O
originally O
had O
paneling O
. O

and O
then O
when O
I O
bought O
the O
house O
in O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
and I-DATE
one I-DATE
I O
had O
new O
walls O
put O
in O
. O

So O
this O
is O
all O
new O
drywall O
in O
here O
. O

So O
mol- O
the O
mold O
growth O
is O
pretty O
substantial O
. O

The O
sunroom O
at O
Kim B-PERSON
Bondy I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
house O
in O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
sure O
could O
use O
a O
little O
sun O
. O

Perhaps O
it O
might O
bake O
away O
the O
multilayered O
mold O
that O
covers O
the O
walls O
and O
fouls O
the O
air O
. O

You O
've O
got O
so O
much O
moisture O
in O
here O
. O

It O
it O
um O
i- O
you O
know O
i- O
so O
much O
damage O
. O

It O
this O
the O
mold O
just O
feeds O
off O
of O
itself O
. O

Kim B-PERSON
invited O
veteran O
property O
restoration O
expert O
Rusty B-PERSON
Amarante I-PERSON
to O
tour O
her O
once O
upon O
a O
dream O
home O
which O
sat O
in O
standing O
fetid O
water O
for O
two B-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
after O
the O
levees O
broke O
. O

Not O
a O
pretty O
picture O
. O

but O
Rusty B-PERSON
Amarante I-PERSON
has O
seen O
it O
all O
before O
. O

Would O
you O
recommend O
that O
a O
room O
like O
this O
be O
sort O
of O
torn O
down O
and O
start O
all O
over O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
need O
to O
tear O
it O
down O
. O

I O
think O
you O
need O
to O
thoroughly O
gut O
it O
. O

You O
need O
to O
take O
out O
. O

Gutting O
a O
house O
, O
stripping O
it O
to O
the O
bones O
like O
a O
Thanksgiving B-DATE
turkey O
seems O
like O
a O
bitter O
pill O
for O
the O
average O
homeowner O
. O

but O
Rusty B-PERSON
has O
a O
way O
of O
putting O
things O
in O
perspective O
. O

Really O
you O
're O
just O
talking O
about O
redoing O
th- O
the O
the O
interior O
building O
envelope O
here O
. O

So O
uh O
a- O
as O
devastating O
as O
it O
is O
you O
're O
really O
kind O
of O
fortunate O
because O
once O
you O
take O
out O
the O
plaster O
, O
once O
you O
take O
out O
the O
insulation O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
building O
is O
dry O
uh O
the O
foundation O
is O
dry O
you O
can O
really O
start O
the O
rebuilding O
process O
. O

And O
. O

But O
what O
about O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
house O
? O

Any O
osteoporosis O
in O
those O
bones O
? O

From O
what O
I O
can O
see O
of O
the O
brick O
from O
the O
outside O
it O
looks O
very O
solid O
. O

For O
some O
answers O
Kim B-PERSON
called O
in O
another O
expert O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
English I-PERSON
a O
professor O
who O
studies O
how O
buildings O
weather O
hurricanes O
. O

Crawl O
space O
. O

Crawl O
space O
. O

I O
've O
never O
even O
looked O
underneath O
there O
. O

But O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
did O
. O

and O
it O
looks O
pretty O
good O
. O

Still O
a O
little O
damp O
down O
here O
. O

and O
that O
needs O
to O
dry O
out O
. O

Mhm O
. O

But O
um O
you O
know O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
-- O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
rot O
at O
this O
point O
. O

It O
was O
a O
cursory O
inspection O
a O
few O
pokes O
and O
peeks O
. O

This O
is O
very O
good O
solid O
construction O
here O
. O

But O
enough O
to O
make O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
a O
big O
believer O
in O
the O
Bondy B-PERSON
bungalow O
. O

If O
this O
were O
your O
house O
what O
would O
you O
do O
? O

I O
'd O
fix O
it O
up O
. O

Yeah O
? O

Absolutely O
. O

Absolutely O
. O

This O
house O
is O
not O
i- O
-- O
is O
not O
a O
goner O
. O

Uh O
this O
house O
this O
house O
coul- O
can O
can O
be O
uh O
repaired O
and O
uh O
and O
brought O
back O
to O
life O
. O

and O
it O
's O
bringing O
the O
individual O
houses O
back O
to O

that O
'll O
bring O
the O

back O

. O

and O
bringing O
New B-GPE

back O

what O

Ever O
since O
uh O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
said O
the O
name O
Samuel B-PERSON
Alito I-PERSON
we O
have O
been O
hearing O
from O
both O
extremes O
of O
the O
political O
spectrum O
. O

The O
far O
right O
loves O
the O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
nominee O
as O
you O
might O
imagine O
. O

The O
far O
left O
ca O
n't O
stand O
him O
. O

We O
're O
learning O
though O
that O
some O
Democrats B-NORP
liberal O
Democrats B-NORP
are O
willing O
to O
give O
Alito B-PERSON
a O
chance O
. O

CNN B-ORG
senior O
political O
correspondent O
Candy B-PERSON
Crowley I-PERSON
explains O
. O

Meet O
Jeffrey B-PERSON
Wasserstein I-PERSON
former O
law O
clerk O
for O
Judge O
Sam B-PERSON
Alito I-PERSON
. O

I O
think O
you O
look O
at O
the O
totality O
of O
his O
career O
and O
what O
you O
see O
is O
a O
judge O
squarely O
within O
the O
mainstream O
. O

Wasserstein B-PERSON
is O
a O
liberal O
Democrat B-NORP
except O
when O
he O
votes O
Green B-ORG
party I-ORG
. O

and O
he O
is O
not O
alone O
. O

He O
's O
hired O
liberals O
conservatives O
libertarians O
independents O
um O
. O

and O
all O
I O
know O
is O
that O
we O
're O
all O
unanimously O
supporting O
the O
judge O
for O
his O
i- O
-- O
in O
his O
nomination O
. O

The O
kind O
of O
testimony O
that O
may O
make O
it O
easier O
for O
people O
like O
Senator O
Ben B-PERSON
Nelson I-PERSON
the O
third B-ORDINAL
Democrat B-NORP
to O
get O
an O
up O
- O
close O
and O
personal O
look O
at O
the O
President O
's O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
nominee O
. O

A O
Democrat B-NORP
from O
Nebraska B-GPE
a O
state O
that O
went O
Bush B-PERSON
in O
oh B-DATE
four I-DATE
Nelson B-PERSON
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
five B-CARDINAL
red O
state O
Democrats B-NORP
up O
for O
reelection O
in O
oh B-DATE
six I-DATE
who O
would O
rather O
vote O
than O
fight O
. O

I O
just O
hope O
that O
we O
're O
able O
to O
work O
our O
way O
through O
and O
uh O
and O
make O
an O
up O
or O
down O
decision O
on O
this O
judge O
. O

He O
's O
not O
even O
a O
member O
of O
the B-ORG
Judiciary I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
. O

but O
Nelson B-PERSON
and O
other O
Democrats B-NORP
are O
targets O
of O
opportunity O
for O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
which O
hopes O
to O
pad O
Republican B-NORP
support O
for O
Alito B-PERSON
with O
enough O
Democrats B-NORP
to O
discourage O
and O
if O
needed O
defeat O
a O
filibuster O
. O

No O
no O
no O
. O

Alito B-PERSON
will O
not O
save O
Roe B-LAW
. O

Here O
's O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
' O
problem O
. O

The O
party O
's O
base O
support O
liberal O
women O
's O
groups O
civil O
rights O
groups O
environmental O
groups O
the O
footsoldiers O
that O
raise O
money O
knock O
on O
doors O
and O
vote O
come O
rain O
or O
shine O
want O
to O
fight O
over O
Alito B-PERSON
. O

An O
argument O
that O
finds O
sympathy O
in O
blue O
state O
Democrats B-NORP
like O
Illinois B-GPE
's O
Dick B-PERSON
Durbin I-PERSON
. O

It O
could O
tip O
the O
balance O
for O
a O
generation O
in O
another O
direction O
on O
critical O
issues O
women O
's O
rights O
and O
workers O
' O
rights O
the O
right O
of O
privacy O
uh O
protecting O
the O
environment O
human O
rights O
civil O
rights O
. O

All O
of O
these O
things O
are O
at O
stake O
in O
this O
nomination O
. O

The O
filibuster O
fight O
to O
please O
Democratic B-NORP
activists O
could O
alienate O
the O
kind O
of O
centrists O
who O
vote O
for O
both O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
and O
Ben B-PERSON
Nelson I-PERSON
in O
the O
same O
state O
which O
is O
why O
the O
word O
filibuster O
makes O
Ben B-PERSON
Nelson I-PERSON
dance O
. O

You O
know O
the O
word O
filibuster O
keeps O
coming O
up O
in O
the O
questions O
rather O
than O
in O
the O
answers O
. O

but O
you O
do O
n't O
rule O
it O
out O
. O

but O
nobody O
's O
ruling O
it O
in O
. O

While O
Democrats B-NORP
still O
hold O
out O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
filibuster O
the O
competing O
need O
to O
please O
the O
base O
and O
reach O
to O
the O
center O
makes O
it O
hard O
to O
find O
consensus O
all O
of O
which O
could O
bode O
well O
for O
Sam B-PERSON
Alito I-PERSON
who O
may O
get O
by O
with O
a O
little O
help O
from O
his O
friends O
. O

There O
was O
never O
an O
ideological O
or O
political O
consideration O
in O
how O
he O
viewed O
cases O
. O

So O
a O
judge O
's O

Judge O

Absolutely O

Well O
Williams B-PERSON
is O

I O

Stanley B-PERSON
Tookie I-PERSON
Williams I-PERSON
co-founded O
the O
Crips O
street O
gang O
. O

He O
robbed O
and O
murdered O
and O
was O
convicted O
of O
his O
crimes O
in O
nineteen B-DATE
eighty I-DATE
- I-DATE
one I-DATE
. O

But O
from O
his O
cell O
on O
death O
row O
Williams B-PERSON
spent O
years O
writing O
children O

books O
and O
preaching O
against O
gang O
violence O
. O

And O
if O
he O
dies O
he O
some O
people O
are O
not O
going O

have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
learn O
from O

Edgar B-PERSON
Medina I-PERSON
read O
the O
books O
and O
says O
Williams B-PERSON
convinced O
him O
to O
stay O
in O
school O
. O

If O
I O
would O
have O
been O
in O
a O
gang O
right O
now O
I O
would O
've O
probably O
be O
in O
jail O
dead O

Instead O
he O
's O
fifteen B-DATE
on O
track O
to O
graduate O
and O
go O
to O
college O

I O
heard O
one O
report O
where O
they O
say O
he O
saved O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
kids O
from O
joining O
gangs O
. O

That O
's O
absurd O
. O

How O
do O
you O
know O
that O
? O

Retired O

Wes B-PERSON

worked O
the O
gang O
detail O
for O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
six I-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
LA B-GPE
County I-GPE
. O

It O
's O
not O
against O
the O
law O
to O
be O
a O
gang O
member O
. O

It O
's O
against O
the O
law O
to O
kill O
people O
. O

and O
that O
's O
what O
he O
's O
convicted O
of O
. O

A O
witness O
says O
Williams B-PERSON
robbed O
and O
executed O
a O
Seven B-ORG
Eleven I-ORG
employee O
then O
made O
fun O
of O
the O
man O
as O
he O
died O
. O

He O
was O
also O
convicted O
of O
gunning O
down O
an O
entire O
family O
father O
mother O

daughter O
. O

Writing O
a O
few O
books O
does O
n't O
exonerate O
you O
from O
your O
crimes O
. O

In O
Williams B-PERSON
' O
case O
it O
wo O
n't O
. O

On O
December B-DATE
thirteenth I-DATE
he O
's O
scheduled O
to O
die O
. O

I O
am O
at O
this O
time O
signing O
a O

of O
execution O
. O

Williams B-PERSON
' O
books O
are O
a O
part O
of O
his O
legacy O
. O

so O
are O
the O
Crips O
. O

In O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
the O
gang O
has O
spread O
from O
California B-GPE
to O
just O
about O
every O
state O
in O
the O

. O

Fred B-PERSON

who O
grow O

He O
says O
they O
really O
listen O
to O
Williams B-PERSON
do O
n't O
tune O
him O
out O
like O
cops O
or O
counselors O
. O

To O
kill O
Stan B-PERSON
will O
be O
throwing O
the O
baby O
out O
with O
the O
bath O
water O
. O

Jackson B-PERSON
says O
executing O
Williams B-PERSON
sends O
the O
wrong O
message O
. O

You O
would O
be O
telling O
gang O
members O
or O
those O
wannabe O
gang O
members O
do O
n't O
care O
how O
you O
turn O
your O
life O
around O
. O

once O
you O
are O
stuck O
you O
are O
stuck O
. O

No O
condemned O
murderer O
has O
been O
granted O
clemency O
in O
California B-GPE
since O
nineteen B-DATE
sixty I-DATE
- I-DATE
seven I-DATE
. O

The O
odds O
are O
against O
any O
man O
even O
one O
like O
Tookie B-PERSON
Williams O
who O
was O
nominated O
for O
a B-WORK_OF_ART
Nobel I-WORK_OF_ART
Peace I-WORK_OF_ART
prize I-WORK_OF_ART

But O
he O
did O
n't O
win O
it O
. O

You O
know O
u- O
and O
even O
if O
he O
did O
i- O
does O
that O
mean O
you O
uh O
you O
're O
forgiven O
for O
murdering O
a O
whole O
family O
? O

No O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

Like O
his O
life O
Tookie B-PERSON
Williams I-PERSON
' I-PERSON

will O
be O
complicated O
. O

Chris B-PERSON

. O

Well O
among O
those O
who O
believe O
Tookie B-PERSON
Williams I-PERSON
' I-PERSON
life O
should O
be O
spared O
is O
Lewis B-PERSON
Yablonsky I-PERSON
a O
criminologist O
expert O
in O
gang O
behavior O
and O
author O
of O
the O
book O
Gangsters B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

He O
joins O
us O
now O
live O
. O

Sir O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
why O
do O
you O
think O
Tookie B-PERSON
should O
not O
die O
? O

Well O
I O
've O
been O
studying O
gangs O
for O
fifty B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

and O
we O
're O
always O
looking O
for O
solutions O
. O

Uh O
here O
's O
a O
man O
who O
has O
changed O
his O
lifestyle O
. O

I O
've O
read O
all O
his O
books O
. O

He O
was O
significant O
in O
contributing O
some O
theories O
to O
my O
book O
uh O
Gangsters B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

and O
I O
think O
he O
can O
be O
a O
positive O
force O
in O
uh O
turning O
around O
young O
gangsters O
. O

In O
fact O
there O
there O
're O
several O
programs O
in O
the B-ORG
California I-ORG
Department I-ORG
of I-ORG
uh I-ORG
Corrections I-ORG
where O
uh O
ex-offenders O
lifer- O
some O
lifers O
are O
working O
with O
young O
offend- O
offenders O
very O
fe- O
effectively O
. O

Uh O
the O
Amity B-ORG
program O
uh O
in O
several O
prisons O
Phoenix B-ORG
program I-ORG
in O
several O
prisons O
. O

and O
uh O
I O
've O
seen O
uh O
the O
impact O
of O
lifers O
individuals O
who O
are O
what O
I O
would O
refer O
to O
as O
experienced O
therapists O
. O

These O
are O
individuals O
who O
've O
been O
there O
like O
Tookie B-PERSON
. O

They O
've O
gone O
through O
a O
transformation O
as O
he O
has O
over O
a B-DATE
period I-DATE
of I-DATE
twenty I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

and O
they O
can O
have O
a O
real O
impact O
on O
some O
of O
the O
younger O
offenders O
to O
not O
go O
down O
their O
path O
and O
end O
up O
in O
the O
-- O
in O
the O
-- O
uh O
being O
executed O
. O

Well O
you O
know O
he O
writes O
in O
his O
memoir O
it O
was O
u- O
ha- O
- O

He O
says O
daily B-DATE
he O
spent O
studying O
and O
questioning O
uh O
and O
soulsearching O
. O

He O
said O
he O
began O
to O
develop O
a O
sense O
of O
critical O
reasoning O
from O
which O
sprang O
the O
first O
stirring O
of O
+conscience O
. O

This O
was O
the O
moment O
when O
redemption O
infused O
itself O
into O
my O
life O
. O

You O
read O
this O
writing O
. O

and O
you O
think O
wow O
this O
is O
somebody O
who O
killed O
three B-CARDINAL
people O
? O

Do O
you O
believe O
that O
that O
murderers O
can O
be O
reformed O
? O

Is O
this O
man O
healthy O
? O

If O
he O
were O
to O
walk O
the O
streets O
again O
would O
he O
never O
kill O
again O
? O

W- O
we O
're O
not O
talking O
about O
letting O
him O
out O
of O
prison O
. O

We O
're O
talking O
about O
clemency O
to O
give O
him O
life O
without O
parole O
where O
we O
do O
n't O
kill O
him O
. O

And O
I O
have O
already O
made O
some O
uh O
efforts O
to O
put O
him O
into O
a O
particular O
program O
where O
he O
would O
uh O
be O
effective O
. O

One O
of O
the O
major O
prob- O
gang O
problems O
uh O
w- O
of O
the O
insanity O
of O
gang O
problems O
is O
young O
black O
men O
killing O
young O
black O
men O
and O
Hispanic B-NORP
kids O
killing O
Hispanic B-NORP
kids O
. O

He O
talks O
a O
lot O
about O
black O
on O
black O
crime O
. O

Tookie B-PERSON
- O

Right O
. O

And O
Tookie B-PERSON
has O
come O
up O
with O
some O
interesting O
observations O
about O
why O
this O
goes O
on O
as O
- O

Uh O
they O
're O
good O
enough O
to O
put O
in O
my O
theoretical O
book O
on O
on O
gangsters O
. O

and O
I O
think O
he O
could O
be O
very O
effective O
in O
a O
program O
. O

and O
as O
I O
've O
indicated O
I O
've O
already O
talked O
to O
the O
director O
of O
uh O
of O
a O
program O
in O
the O
California B-GPE
prison O
system O
. O

And O
if O
Governor O
Schwarzenegger B-PERSON
really O
means O
what O
he O
says O
about O
uh O
the B-ORG
California I-ORG
Department I-ORG
of I-ORG
Corrections I-ORG
with O
emphasis O
on O
corrections O
and O
rehabilitation O
he O
should O
spare O
his O
life O
. O

But O
- O

He O
's O
really O
the O
only O
one O
who O
can O
do O
it O
. O

and O
as O
I O
've O
- O

Well O
Lewis O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
. O

what O
what O
what O
u- O
let O
's O
say O
he O
is O
granted O
clemency O
. O

what O
do O
you O
say O
to O
the O
victims O
' O
families O
? O

Well O
we O
we O
talk O
about O
redemption O
. O

We O
talk O
about O
forgiveness O
. O

Let O
's O
put O
it O
this O
way O
. O

Uh O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
I O
was O
a O
different O
person O
than O
I O
am O
now O
. O

I O
think O
Tookie B-PERSON
Williams I-PERSON
from O
my O
communications O
with O
him O
is O
a O
different O
person O
today B-DATE
than O
when O
we O
was O
convicted O
of O
these O
crimes O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
uh O
excusing O
the O
crimes O
. O

and O
I O
'm O
not O
necessarily O
uh O
against O
the O
death O
penalty O
. O

Uh O
some O
individuals O
perhaps O
should O
get O
the O
death O
penalty O
. O

but O
this O
is O
a O
man O
who O
can O
contribute O
to O
our O
society O
. O

and O
he O
can O
be O
ef- O
effective O
. O

I O
know O
who O
police O
off- O
-- O
I O
know O
how O
police O
officers O
feel O
about O
it O

but O
- O

I O
I O

and O
you O

thank O
you O
sir O
so O
much O
for O
your O
time O
. O

And O
we O
talked O
about O
family O
members O
. O

and O
Lora B-PERSON
Owens I-PERSON
is O
the O
stepmother O
of O
Albert B-PERSON
Owens I-PERSON
the O
convenience O
store O
worker O
that O
Tookie B-PERSON
Williams I-PERSON
was O
convicted O
of O
killing O
. O

She O
joins O
us O
now O
by O
phone O
. O

and O
I O
appreciate O
your O
time O
Lora B-PERSON
. O

I O
want O
to O
take O
a B-TIME
moment I-TIME
to O
talk O
about O
Albert B-PERSON
if O
you O
do O
n't O
mind O
and O
just O
uh O
remind O
us O
about O
his O
life O
. O

Okay O
. O

Go O
ahead O
Lora B-PERSON
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
having O
me O
on O
. O

I O
appreciate O
the O
opportunity O
to O
be O
able O
to O
even O
speak O
about O
Albert B-PERSON
. O

He O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
forgotten O
one O
. O

Unfortunately O
the O
Owens B-PERSON
family O
studied O
gangs O
specifically O
the O
gang O
that O
Williams B-PERSON
had O
because O
it O
affected O
our O
life O
. O

Do O
you O
have O
any O
idea O
the O
impact O
that O
it O
has O
had O
on O
the O
Owens B-PERSON
family O
? O

See O
the O
picture O
of O
my O
son O
? O

We O
see O
him O
. O

That O
's O
a O
a O
man O
that O
went O
out O
. O

he O
wanted O
to O
make O
an O
honest O
living O
where O
Williams B-PERSON
goes O
out O
to O
take O
whatever O
he O
wants O
. O

Now O
we O
have O
a O
major O
impact O
. O

Life O
's O
different O
now O
because O
of O
what O
Williams B-PERSON
did O
to O
the O
Owens B-PERSON
family O
. O

Life O
's O
a O
lot O
different O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
study O
gangs O
. O

I O
only O
have O
to O
study O
what O
Williams B-PERSON
did O
. O

Is O
death O
- O

A O
big O
difference O
. O

Lora B-PERSON
is O
death O
the O
answer O
? O

Does O
Tookie B-PERSON
Williams I-PERSON
need O
to O
die O
? O

Is O
that O
what O
would O
make O
you O
feel O
better O
would O
make O
your O
family O
feel O
better O
? O

It O
's O
called O
closure O
Miss O
Phillips B-PERSON
. O

That O
's O
what O
it O
's O
called O
because O
when O
someone O
like O
Williams B-PERSON
can O
do O
all O
of O
these O
things O
- O

What O
what O
does O
has O
he O
paid O
? O

He O
does O
n't O
even O
say O
he O
's O
guilty O
. O

He O
says O
he O
's O
innocent O
. O

Alright O
so O
you O
have O
to O
do O
that O
with O
all O
of O
the O
appeals O
. O

He O
says O
he O
's O
sorry O
. O

For O
what O
. O

that O
he O
did O
n't O
get O
away O
with O
it O
? O

He O
could O
do O
so O
much O
to O
stop O
gangs O
. O

He O
- O

Is O
he O
? O

No O
he O
does O
n't O
do O
any O
of O
that O
. O

What O
he O
does O
is O
find O
somebody O
who O
's O
willing O
to O
write O
for O
him O
somebody O
who O
's O
out O
there O
with O
the O
cause O
. O

Williams B-PERSON
is O
n't O
the O
important O
one O
in O
this O
right O
to O
life O
cause O
. O

It O
's O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
is O
a O
cause O
. O

and O
he O
's O
got O
all O
of O
these O
people O
behind O
him O
. O

They O
have O
n't O
walked O
where O
the O
Owens B-PERSON
family O
has O
walked O
. O

They O
have O
n't O
had O
to O
take O
someone O
who O
's O
been O
murdered O
and O
try O
and O
build O
a O
life O
without O
them O
. O

Lora B-PERSON
T- O
T- O
Tookie B-PERSON
has O
this O
apology O
uh O
that O
he O
has O
written O
that O
of O
course O
he O
wants O
everybody O
t- O
t- O
to O
hear O
. O

Part O
of O
it O
says O

also O
pray O
that O
your O
suffering O
caused O
by O
gang O
violence O
will O
soon O

an O
end O
as O
more O
gang O
members O
wake O
up O
and O
stop O
hurting O
themselves O
and O
others O
. O

I O
vow O
to O
spend O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
working O
toward O
solutions O
. O

Does O
that O
give O
you O
any O
sense O
of O
peace O
? O

He O
did O
n't O
write O
it O
to O
us O
. O

That O
's O
not O
who O
he O
wrote O
that O
to O

He O
wrote O
that O

further O
his O

That O

who O
he O

There O

a O
lot O

Still O

The O

A O

tragedy O

First B-ORDINAL
it O

in O
the O

of O
a O

Soon O
though O
it O
may O
be O
the O
freezing O

and O
the O

of O
a O
bitter O
winter B-DATE
that O

going O

The O

already O
brutal O

eighty B-CARDINAL

Another B-CARDINAL

not O
even O
a O

in O
some O

More B-CARDINAL

two I-CARDINAL

Many O
in O

where O

even O

seem O
to O

Now O
ITV B-ORG

Bill B-PERSON
Neely I-PERSON
reports O
. O

that O
's O
just O
from O
the B-LOC
Kashmir I-LOC
region I-LOC
. O

that O
's O
the O
area O
right O
between O
India B-GPE
and O
Pakistan B-GPE
. O

The O

are O
still O
busy O
here O
. O

but O
the O
weather O
is O
worsening O
. O

There O
are O
days B-DATE
they O
wo O
n't O
fly O
and O
places O
they O
wo O
n't O
go O
. O

Into O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
these O
today B-DATE
came O
Save B-ORG
the I-ORG
Children I-ORG
driving O
a O
convoy O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
tents O
six B-QUANTITY
thousand I-QUANTITY
feet I-QUANTITY
up O
into O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
Kashmir B-LOC
's O
most O
remote O
corners O
. O

There O
waiting O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
villagers O
. O

this O
aid O
the O
difference O
between O
life O
and O
death O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
man O
at O
least O
has O
suffered O
enough O
death O
. O

Is O
seven B-CARDINAL
kids O
one B-CARDINAL
mom O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
wife O
. O

He O
lost O
his O
seven B-CARDINAL
children O
. O

Seven B-CARDINAL
children O
. O

He O
lost O
his O
seven B-CARDINAL
childrens O
plus O
eh O
his O
wife O
and O
eh O
his O
mom O
. O

Even O
the O
blind O
walked O
for O
hours B-TIME
across O
a O
mountain O
to O
get O
here O
. O

The O
tents O
blankets O
and O
clothes O
their O
only O
protection O
against O
a O
brutal O
winter O
. O

It O
's O
a O
race O
here O
against O
time O
and O
against O
the O
heavy O
snows O
that O
are O
on O
their O
way O
. O

In O
about B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
time O
these O
mountains O
and O
this O
valley O
will O
be O
covered O
in O
snow O
. O

and O
the O
logic O
of O
survival O
then O
is O
brutally O
simple O
. O

Anyone O
without O
shelter O
will O
die O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
there O
are O
n't O
enough O
tents O
here O
or O
anywhere O
else O
. O

so O
a O
second O
disaster O
that O
the O
UN B-ORG
says O
could O
kill O
thousands B-CARDINAL
is O
n't O
just O
looming O
. O

it O
's O
highly O
likely O
. O

These O
children O
survived O
the O
earthquake O
. O

Twenty B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
did O
n't O
. O

The O
coming O
cold O
and O
hunger O
could O
carry O
off O
thousands B-CARDINAL
more O
. O

So O
they O
struggle O
away O
with O
their O
tents O
. O

and O
even O
the O
aid O
workers O
who O
've O
been O
through O
the O
tsunami O
struggle O
to O
cope O
here O
. O

Logistically O
it O
's O
the O
worst O
without O
a O
doubt O
. O

It O
's O
getting O
high O
in O
mountains O
. O

The O
road O
that O
we O
came O
up O
now O
is O
pretty O
perilous O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

but O
we O
could O
get O
vehicles O
up O
. O

We O
're O
talking O
about O
a O
lot O
of O
places O
have O
got O
no O
vehicular O
access O
whatsoever O
. O

Then O
we O
're O
talking O
meal O
trains O
and O
helicopters O
. O

and O
we O
're O
really O
running O
out O
of O
time O
. O

It O
's O
quite O
a O
serious O
situation O
. O

the O
tsunami O
was O
much O
easier O
to O
deal O
with O
than O
this O
? O

The O
tsunami O
did O
n't O
have O
winter B-DATE
coming O
. O

I O
mean O
here O
we O
've O
just O
got O
this O
hammer O
blow O
that O
's O
going O
to O
come O
down O
very O
very O
shortly O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
disaster O
was O
an O
act O
of O
god O
. O

A O
second B-ORDINAL
can O
be O
prevented O
by O
time O
. O

and O
aid O
money O
is O
running O
out O
. O

As O
we O
left O
night B-TIME
fell O
. O

and O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
snow O
fell O
too O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
settle O

but O
it O
will O
soon O

Pakistan B-GPE

straight O

About O
one B-CARDINAL

eighty I-CARDINAL

Duh O
dad O
as O
my O

would O
say O

To O
Dylan B-PERSON
Lauren I-PERSON
though O
who O
inherited O
a O

smarts O
from O
her O

that O
would O
be O
Ralph B-PERSON
Lauren I-PERSON
the O
film O
was O
a O
a O
big O

candy O

business O
plan O

That O
's O
why O
she O
as O
you O

Hi O
I O
'm O
Dylan B-PERSON
Lauren I-PERSON
. O

And O
I O
am O
a O
candy O
lover O
. O

So O
I O
decided O
to O
take O
my O
passion O
and O
create O
the O
world O
's O
largest O
candy O
store O
and O
fill O
it O
with O
candy O
and O
anything O
candy O
related O
. O

That O
's O
what O
Dylan B-ORG
the I-ORG
Candy I-ORG
Bar I-ORG
is O
. O

It O
's O
an O
homage O
to O
candy O
. O

I O
was O
inspired O
when O
I O
was O
younger O
by O
uh O
Charlie B-WORK_OF_ART
and I-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Chocolate I-WORK_OF_ART
Factory I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

And O
it O
's O
a O
bunch O
of O
stores O
that O
have O
a O
sort O
of O
entertainment O
philosophy O
. O

And O
I O
just O
thought O
there O
's O
not O
anything O
like O
that O
in O
the O
candy O
business O
that O
you O
know O
- O

FAO B-ORG
Schwartz I-ORG
had O
it O
with O
toys O
. O

or O
Niketown B-ORG
has O
it O
with O
sneakers O
. O

I O
thought O
would O
n't O
it O
be O
fun O
for O
even O
me O
who O
's O
a O
candy O
freak O
to O
just O
walk O
in O
and O
have O
this O
like O
oversized O
emporium O
of O
oversized O
lollipops O
. O

I O
have O
four B-CARDINAL
stores O

I O

The O

Well O
this O
is O
my O
office O

I O
've O
always O
loved O
candy O
. O

At O
first O
it O
was O
about O
the O
taste O
. O

I O
love O
gummy O
bears O
and O
gummy O
fish O
. O

I O
just O
always O
started O
to O
look O
at O
candy O
's O
packaging O
. O

And O
as O
an O
art O
history O
major O
I O
also O
was O
influenced O
by O
a O
lot O
of O
pop O
artists O
. O

This O
is O
our O
stripe O
which O
are O
on O
our O
bags O
and O
our O
logos O
. O

I O
really O
loved O
art O
and O
candy O
. O

Did O
you O
like O
the O
ones O
that O
we O
were O
talking O
about O
for O
the O
malls O
though O
? O

Our O
theme O
is O
to O
basically O
merge O
pop O
culture O
art O
fashion O
with O
candy O
and O
also O
to O
have O
like O
the O
largest O
assortment O
of O
colors O
and O
flavors O
. O

This O
is O
our O
body O
uh O
shake O
. O

It O
's O
a O
milk O
bubble O
bath O
chocolate O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
just O
carry O
candy O
per O
se O
to O
eat O
. O

We O
have O
a O
spa O
product O
like O
chocolate O

powders O
and O
vanilla O
body O
moisturizers O

We O
're O
expanding O

our O
own O

Our O
customer O
is O
really O
the O

the O

and O
it O

I O
think O
the O

everyone O

And O
I O
definitely O
am O

I O
do O

people O
do O
n't O
know O
how O

People O
think O
I O
'm O
fifteen B-DATE
because O
I O
love O
candy O
and O
I O
love O
colors O
. O

But O
I O
I O
I O
have O
a O
mature O
sensibility O
about O
it O
too O
. O

But O
I O
think O
you O
have O
to O
have O
the O
sort O
of O
attitude O
of O
creativity O
and O
fun O
and O
anything O
is O
possible O

The O
Pentagon B-ORG
is O
a O
haunted O
house O
. O

Living O
there O
for O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
was O
really O
scary O
. O

The O
ghosts O
of O
the O
past O
are O
everywhere O
: O
They O
are O
kept O
at O
bay O
only O
by O
feeding O
them O
vast O
quantities O
of O
our O
defense O
budget O
. O

Some O
can O
be O
bought O
off O
relatively O
cheaply O
. O

During O
the B-EVENT
Korean I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
, O
Gen. O
Douglas B-PERSON
MacArthur I-PERSON
demanded O
and O
got O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
U.N. B-ORG
command O
in O
Korea B-GPE
, O
his O
own O
naval O
command O
in O
Japan B-GPE
, O
NavforJapan B-ORG
. O

Those O
obsolete O
operations O
cost O
less B-MONEY
than I-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
2 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
a O
year O
, O
and O
keep O
Mac B-PERSON
's O
ghost O
quiet O
. O

That O
's O
about O
all O
it O
costs O
to O
appease O
Adm. O
Erich B-PERSON
Raeder I-PERSON
's O
ghost O
. O

In O
1941 B-DATE
, O
Raeder B-PERSON
and O
the O
German B-NORP
navy O
threatened O
to O
attack O
the B-FAC
Panama I-FAC
Canal I-FAC
, O
so O
we O
created O
the B-ORG
Southern I-ORG
Command I-ORG
in O
Panama B-GPE
. O

The B-ORG
Southern I-ORG
Command I-ORG
has O
grown O
even O
bigger O
since O
the O
war O
because O
Raeder B-PERSON
's O
ghost O
sometimes O
runs O
through O
the O
E O
ring O
dressed O
like O
Gen. O
Noriega B-PERSON
. O

The O
Command B-ORG
's O
huge O
bureaucracy O
is O
needed O
to O
analyze O
whether O
leaders O
of O
coups O
against O
Gen. O
Noriega B-PERSON
meet O
the B-LAW
War I-LAW
Powers I-LAW
Act I-LAW
's I-LAW
six B-CARDINAL

, O
Cap B-PERSON
Weinberger I-PERSON

seven B-CARDINAL

, O
the B-ORG
Intelligence I-ORG
Committee I-ORG

32 B-CARDINAL

and O
Woodrow B-PERSON

14 B-CARDINAL
points O
necessary O
to O
justify O
U.S. B-GPE
support O
. O

So O
far O
no O
one O
has O
. O

The O
ghost O
of O
the O
Soviet B-NORP
brigade O
discovered O
in O
Cuba B-GPE
back O
in O
the O
'70s B-DATE
costs O
just B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
few I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
: O
the O
price O
of O
the B-ORG
Caribbean I-ORG
Command I-ORG
in O
Key B-LOC
West I-LOC
that O
President O

created O
in O
1980 B-DATE
. O

The O
brigade O
has O
n't O
been O
heard O
from O
since O
, O
but O
we O
keep O
the O
staff O
around O
just O
in O
case O
. O

George B-PERSON
Marshall I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
ghost O
is O
much O
more O
difficult O
to O
keep O
happy O
. O

We O
keep O
a O
lot O
of O
shrines O
to O
him O
around O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
: O
statues O
, O
busts O
, O
relics O
and O
such O
. O

The O
Army B-ORG
headquarters O
on O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
deck O
of O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
used O
to O
burn O
a O
lot O
of O
incense O
to O
him O
, O
but O
the O
Navy B-ORG
headquarters O
on O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
deck O
made O
them O
stop O
it O
. O

You O
see O
, O
Marshall B-PERSON
had O
this O
thing O
about O
the O
Navy B-ORG
and O
the O
Marines B-ORG
-- O
he O
wanted O
to O
make O
them O
part O
of O
the O
Army B-ORG
but O
Secretary O
of O
the O
Navy B-ORG
James B-PERSON
Forrestal I-PERSON
blocked O
him O
. O

Now O
his O
ghost O
wo O
n't O
let O
up O
till O
it O
's O
done O
. O

To O
keep O
him O
quiet O
we O
invent O
a O
new O
unified O
command O
every B-DATE
year I-DATE
or O
so O
run O
by O
the O
Army B-ORG
or O
the B-ORG
Air I-ORG
Force I-ORG
and O
put O
more O
of O
the O
Navy B-ORG
and O
Marines B-ORG
under O
it O
. O

But O
we O
still O
hear O
him O
moaning O
at O
night B-TIME
because O
the O
Navy B-ORG
has O
a O
few O
ships O
left O
, O
and O
to O
satisfy O
him O
the O
Navy B-ORG
's O
sea O
lift O
forces O
were O
given O
to O
a O
new O
Air B-ORG
Force I-ORG
bureaucracy O
in O
Illinois B-GPE
, O
its O
space O
operations O
to O
another O
command O
in O
Colorado B-GPE
, O
the O
frogmen O
to O
a O
new O
Army B-ORG
bureaucracy O
in O
Fort B-GPE
Bragg I-GPE
, O
and O
the O
Navy B-ORG
's O
Indian B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
and O
Persian B-LOC
Gulf I-LOC
forces O
to O
an O
Army B-ORG
bureaucracy O
in O
Florida B-GPE
. O

Which O
brings O
up O
the O
worst O
and O
meanest O
ghost O
of O
all O
-- O
the O
ghost O
of O
the O
shah O
of O
Iran B-GPE
. O

When O
the O
shah O
died O
, O
President O
Carter B-PERSON
was O
so O
scared O
that O
the O
shah O
's O
ghost O
would O
blame O
him O
for O
shoving O
him O
out O
to O
make O
way O
for O
the O
ayatollah O
that O
he O
declared O
the O
Carter O
Doctrine O
. O

Mr. O
Carter B-PERSON
said O
he O
would O
go O
to O
war O
to O
stop O
anyone O
from O
trying O
to O
grab O
Iran B-GPE
. O

But O
that O
ghost O
would O
n't O
settle O
for O
words O
, O
he O
wanted O
money O
and O
people O
-- O
lots O
. O

So O
Mr. O
Carter B-PERSON
formed O
three B-CARDINAL
new O
Army B-ORG
divisions O
and O
gave O
them O
to O
a O
new O
bureaucracy O
in O
Tampa B-GPE
called O
the B-ORG
Rapid I-ORG
Deployment I-ORG
Force I-ORG
. O

But O
that O
ghost O
was O
n't O
fooled O
; O
he O
knew O
the O
RDF B-ORG
was O
neither O
rapid O
nor O
deployable O
nor O
a O
force O
-- O
even O
though O
it O
cost O
$ B-MONEY
8 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
or O
$ B-MONEY
10 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
a O
year O
. O

After O
Mr. O
Carter B-PERSON
was O
defeated O
in O
1980 B-DATE
, O
the O
shah O
's O
ghost O
claimed O
the O
credit O
and O
then O
went O
after O
President O
Reagan B-PERSON
and O
Cap B-PERSON
Weinberger I-PERSON
. O

I O
saw O
what O
he O
did O
to O
them O
firsthand O
. O

It O
made O
my O
shoelaces O
dance O
with O
terror O
. O

Why O
, O
he O
used O
to O
lay O
in O
wait O
for O
Cap B-PERSON
; O
suddenly O
he O
'd O
leap O
from O
behind O
some O
statue O
of O
Marshall B-PERSON
onto O
Cap B-PERSON
's O
chest O
and O
grab O
him O
by O
the O
throat O
and O
choke O
him O
till O
he O
coughed O
up O
an O
additional B-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
2 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
or O
so O
. O

Cap B-PERSON
added O
four B-CARDINAL
more O
divisions O
to O
the O
Army B-ORG
, O
two B-CARDINAL
active O
and O
two B-CARDINAL
reserve O
; O
two B-CARDINAL
carrier O
groups O
to O
the O
Navy B-ORG
; O
a O
division O
-- O
equivalent O
to O
the O
Marines B-ORG
; O
and O
the O
C B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
5B I-PRODUCT
, O
KC B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
10 I-PRODUCT
, O
C B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
17 I-PRODUCT
and O
a O
thousand B-CARDINAL
tactical O
aircraft O
to O
the B-ORG
Air I-ORG
Force I-ORG
. O

He O
bought O
$ B-MONEY
4 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
in O
prepositioning O
ships O
and O
$ B-MONEY
7 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
in O
ammo O
and O
equipment O
to O
fill O
them O
, O
and O
parked O
them O
at O
a O
new O
$ B-MONEY
6 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
base O
at O
Diego B-LOC
Garcia I-LOC
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the B-LOC
Indian I-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
. O

He O
dedicated O
all O
these O
new O
forces O
to O
the B-LOC
Persian I-LOC
Gulf I-LOC
. O

One B-TIME
night I-TIME
both O
Marshall B-PERSON
's O
ghost O
and O
the O
shah O
's O
ghost O
together O
caught O
Cap B-PERSON
and O
threw O
him O
to O
the O
ground O
. O

Before O
they O
let O
him O
go O
he O
added O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
bureaucrats O
to O
the O
RDF B-ORG
in O
Tampa B-GPE
and O
renamed O
it O
Central B-ORG
Command I-ORG
. O

He O
gave O
those O
bureaucrats O
charge O
of O
all O
naval O
operations O
in O
the O
Persian B-LOC
Gulf I-LOC
and O
Indian B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
. O

Marshall B-PERSON
figured O
it O
would O
be O
good O
training O
for O
those O
soldiers O
-- O
someday O
maybe O
they O
would O
get O
the O
whole O
Navy B-ORG
. O

They O
had O
fun O
moving O
the O
carriers O
around O
, O
but O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
they O
had O
forgotten O
all O
about O
mine O
sweepers O
. O

But O
the O
shah O
still O
kept O
leaping O
out O
at O
Cap B-PERSON
, O
so O
Cap B-PERSON
bought O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
merchant O
ships O
more O
and O
$ B-MONEY
7 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
of O
loading O
barges O
, O
ramps O
, O
etc. O
, O
in O
order O
that O
those O
seven B-CARDINAL
new O
Army B-ORG
divisions O
and O
three B-CARDINAL
Marine B-ORG
brigades O
could O
unload O
from O
all O
those O
new O
ships O
and O
aircraft O
and O
go O
to O
war O
in O
the B-LOC
Zagros I-LOC
mountains I-LOC
. O

Then O
suddenly O
Ike B-PERSON
's O
ghost O
came O
to O
visit O
and O
said O
, O
`` O
What O
the O
hell O
are O
you O
doing O
planning O
for O
a O
land O
war O
in O
Asia B-LOC
12,000 B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
away O
? O

We O
'd O
get O
our O
asses O
kicked O
. O
'' O

Lucky O
for O
Cap B-PERSON
, O
Ike B-PERSON
was O
easygoing O
and O
soon O
went O
away O
, O
while O
the O
shah O
-- O
he O
kept O
coming O
back O
. O

So O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
found O
itself O
paying O
about B-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
2 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
in O
baksheesh O
to O
various O
Arab B-NORP
potentates O
for O
basing O
rights O
around O
the B-LOC
Indian I-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
. O

We O
had O
great O
success O
in O
Somalia B-GPE
. O

But O
then O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
President O
Siad B-PERSON
Barrah I-PERSON
was O
not O
at O
all O
a O
nice O
person O
and O
the O
Navy B-ORG
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
base O
he O
promised O
us O
in O
Berbera B-GPE
had O
silted O
up O
about B-DATE
a I-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
and O
anyway O
was O
1,244 B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
from O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
Gulf B-LOC
. O

-LRB- O
But O
who O
's O
counting O
. O
-RRB- O

Still O
, O
Berbera B-GPE
was O
the O
best O
we O
could O
get O
, O
so O
we O
stay O
in O
bed O
with O
President O
Barrah B-PERSON
. O

All O
these O
reports O
about O
him O
committing O
genocide O
are O
probably O
exaggerated O
anyway O
. O

But O
would O
n't O
you O
know O
, O
now O
that O
we O
are O
spending O
jillions B-MONEY
of I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
, O
and O
have O
built O
those O
new O
divisions O
and O
new O
air O
wings O
, O
and O
have O
positioned O
all O
these O
ships O
and O
supplies O
to O
fight O
the O
Russians B-NORP
in O
Iran B-GPE
, O
the O
Russians B-NORP
seem O
to O
have O
lost O
interest O
in O
the O
whole O
subject O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Congress B-ORG
is O
cutting O
huge O
chunks O
out O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
defense O
budget O
. O

Predictably O
, O
some O
Navy B-ORG
guys O
said O
: O
`` O
Do O
we O
still O
need O
to O
keep O
all O
18 B-CARDINAL
Army B-ORG
divisions O
on O
active O
duty O
and O
all O
those O
extra O
land O
- O
based O
aircraft O
without O

and O
all O
those O
Army B-ORG
guys O
playing O
admiral O
in O
Tampa B-GPE
? O

Could O
n't O
we O
save O
$ B-MONEY
20 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
or O
$ B-MONEY
30 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
a O
year O
by O
shifting O
that O
stuff O
to O
the O

? O

And O
why O
not O
save O
the O
costs O
of O
a B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
bureaucrats O
by O
abolishing O
Central B-ORG
Command I-ORG
and O
putting O
responsibility O
for O
Gulf B-LOC
naval O
operations O
back O
where O
it O
belongs O
, O
afloat O
with O
the O
task O

And O
where O

all O

allies O
last B-DATE

when O
our O

were O
being O

? O
'' O

Questions O
like O
that O
really O
stir O
up O
Marshall B-PERSON
's O
ghost O
. O

He O
appeared O
late B-TIME
one I-TIME
night I-TIME
in O
the O
bedroom O
of O
the O
new O
defense O
secretary O
, O
Dick B-PERSON
Cheney I-PERSON
. O

Marshall B-PERSON
came O
clanking O
in O
like O
Marley B-PERSON
's O
ghost O
dragging O
those O
chains O
of O
brigades O
and O
air O
wings O
and O
links O
with O
Arab B-NORP
despots O
. O

He O
would O
n't O
leave O
until O
Mr. O
Cheney B-PERSON
promised O
to O
do O
whatever O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
systems O
analysts O
told O
him O
. O

So O
next B-DATE
day I-DATE
Mr. O
Cheney B-PERSON
went O
out O
and O
did O
just O
that O
: O
He O
canceled O
the O
600 B-CARDINAL
- O
ship O
Navy B-ORG
and O
cut O
back O
one B-CARDINAL
carrier O
and O
20 B-CARDINAL
frigates O

Then O
he O
canceled O
production O
of O
the O
Navy B-ORG

the B-PRODUCT
F I-PRODUCT

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Mr. O

retained O
all O

Marshall B-PERSON

is O
satisfied O
for O
now O

The O

in O
place O

A O
plan O
to O
bring O
the O
stock O
to O
market O
before O
year B-DATE
end I-DATE
apparently O
was O
upset O
by O
the O

What O
happened O
Friday B-DATE
shows O
that O
financial O
markets O
are O
not O
yet O
sufficiently O
coordinated O
to O
handle O
another O
meltdown O
in O
prices O
. O

No O
fiddling O
with O
systems O
and O
procedures O
will O
ever O
prevent O
markets O
from O
suffering O
a O
panic O
wave O
of O
selling O
. O

But O
markets O
can O
operate O
with O
greater O
or O
lesser O
efficiency O
. O

After O
the O
1987 B-DATE
plunge O
, O
markets O
agreed O
that O
it O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
halt O
trading O
whenever O
panic O
conditions O
arose O
. O

The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Stock I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
adopted O
two B-CARDINAL
specific O
circuit O
breakers O
: O
If O
the O
Dow B-ORG
Jones I-ORG
index O
falls O
250 B-CARDINAL
points O
in O
a B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
the O
exchange O
will O
halt O
trading O
for O
one B-TIME
hour I-TIME
; O
if O
the O
decline O
hits O
400 B-CARDINAL
points O
, O
the O
exchange O
will O
close O
for O
an O
additional O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

The O
rationale O
is O
that O
an O
interruption O
of O
trading O
will O
allow O
investors O
to O
reconsider O
their O
strategies O
, O
calm O
sellers O
and O
lead O
buyers O
to O
enter O
the O
market O
at O
indicated O
new O
price O
levels O
. O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
know O
whether O
that O
theory O
is O
realistic O
. O

A O
temporary O
cessation O
of O
trading O
may O
indeed O
discourage O
a O
selling O
panic O
from O
feeding O
on O
itself O
. O

But O
there O
is O
also O
the O
possibility O
that O
shutting O
down O
markets O
will O
intensify O
fears O
and O
cause O
an O
even O
more O
abrupt O
slide O
in O
prices O
. O

What O
happened O
Friday B-DATE
was O
the O
worst O
of O
all O
worlds O
. O

The O
futures O
exchanges O
followed O
their O
own O
pre-set O
circuit O
breakers O
and O
shut O
down O
at O
about B-TIME
3 I-TIME
p.m. I-TIME
for O
30 B-TIME

, O
after O
the B-ORG
Standard I-ORG

had O
fallen O
12 B-CARDINAL

or O
about B-CARDINAL
100 I-CARDINAL
points O
on O
the O
Dow B-ORG
Jones I-ORG
index O
. O

Options O

The B-ORG
New I-ORG

, O
under O
its O
own O
rules O
, O
remained O

With O
nowhere O
else O

go O
, O

, O

, O
focused O
all O
their O

on O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG

. O

As O
liquidity O
on O
that O
market O
weakened O
, O
prices O
fell O
sharply O
. O

Had O
the O
futures O
and O
options O
markets O
been O
open O
, O
additional O
liquidity O
would O
have O
been O
provided O
and O
the O
decline O
, O
most O
probably O
, O
would O
have O
been O
less O
intense O
. O

At O
3:30 B-TIME
, O
after O
intense O
telephone O
negotiations O
between O
the O
trading O
markets O
and O
Washington B-GPE
, O
the O
futures O
exchanges O
reopened O
. O

Futures O
trading O
, O
however O
, O
was O
halted O
altogether O
at O
3:45 B-TIME
, O
after O
the O
futures O
markets O
had O
dropped O
an B-CARDINAL
additional I-CARDINAL
30 I-CARDINAL
points O
, O
which O
is O
the O
daily B-DATE
limit O
for O
price O
declines O
. O

At O
this O
point O
, O
the O
options O
markets O
also O
shut O
down O
and O
once O
more O
left O
all O
sales O
to O
be O
handled O
by O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Stock I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
. O

It O
is O
time O
to O
recognize O
that O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Stock I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
, O
the O
futures O
markets O
and O
the O
options O
markets O
, O
though O
physically O
separate O
, O
have O
actually O
become O
so O
closely O
intertwined O
as O
to O
constitute O
one B-CARDINAL
market O
effectively O
. O

Traders O
can O
vary O
their O
strategies O
and O
execute O
their O
orders O
in O
any O
one O
of O
them O
. O

It O
therefore O
makes O
no O
sense O
for O
each O
market O
to O
adopt O
different O
circuit O
breakers O
. O

To O
achieve O
maximum O
liquidity O
and O
minimize O
price O
volatility O
, O
either O
all O
markets O
should O
be O
open O
to O
trading O
or O
none O
. O

Synchronized O
circuit O
breakers O
would O
not O
have O
halted O
the O
slide O
in O
prices O
on O
Friday B-DATE
, O
but O
they O
probably O
would O
have O
made O
for O
smoother O
, O
less O
volatile O
executions O
. O

It O
's O
time O
for O
the O
exchanges O
and O
the B-ORG
Securities I-ORG
and I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
to O
agree O
on O
joint O
conditions O

Let O

30 B-TIME

when O
the O

100 B-CARDINAL

and O
another O
shut O
down O
for O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
after O
a O

. O

The O

for O

will O
disappear O
once O
rules O
are O

that O

in O
all O

. O

The O
new O
circuit O
breakers O
, O
if O
they O
are O
to O
be O
applied O
at O
all O
, O
will O
require O
that O

as O
long O
as O
the B-ORG

It O
is O
unreasonable O
to O
block O
roads O
and O
cut O
off O
traffic O
even O
if O
the O
villagers O
' O
homes O
were O
being O
damaged O
by O
the O
blasting O
for O
road O
construction O
and O
the O
economy O
was O
being O
hurt O
; O
these O
methods O
are O
illegal O
and O
harm O
innocent O
bystanders O
; O
they O
are O
unacceptable O
. O

If O
there O
is O
a O
problem O
, O
they O
should O
seek O
out O
the O
concerned O
departments O
, O
that O
's O
all O
. O

However O
, O
the O
villagers O
' O
agitation O
has O
its O
own O
reasons O
. O

You O
might O
say O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
helped O
. O

If O
they O
had O
been O
able O
to O
resolve O
the O
problem O
through O
regular O
channels O
, O
they O
would O
n't O
have O
taken O
such O
a O
step O
. O

China B-GPE
's O
peasants O
are O
simple O
and O
decent O
folk O
; O
quite O
often O
when O
they O
get O
the O
short O
end O
of O
the O
stick O
they O
suffer O
in O
silence O
. O

If O
it O
is O
not O
something O
that O
affects O
their O
livelihood O
, O
they O
are O
not O
easily O
moved O
to O
take O
action O
. O

They O
may O
be O
simple O
and O
decent O
and O
may O
accept O
bullying O
, O
but O
when O
someone O
rides O
on O
their O
backs O
and O
dumps O
on O
them O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
take O
it O
any O
more O
, O
and O
they O
explode O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
the O
concerned O
parties O
' O
disregard O
for O
the O
people O
's O
interests O
is O
the O
basic O
reason O
that O
brought O
this O
on O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
in O
this O
disturbance O
both O
the O
villagers O
and O
the O
police O
are O
the O
victims O
of O
bureaucracy O
. O

In O
the O
news O
reports O
, O
we O
clearly O
felt O
that O
the O
behavior O
of O
the O
police O
went O
beyond O
enforcement O
of O
the O
law O
; O
their O
behavior O
infringed O
on O
human O
rights O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
the O
dustup O
began O
between O
the O
people O
and O
the O
police O
, O
" O
One O
policeman O
took O
out O
a O
camera O
and O
photographed O
me O
; O
I O
used O
my O
hand O
to O
block O
it O
, O
and O
another O
policeman O
kicked O
me O
in O
the O
stomach O
. O

I O
immediately O
squatted O
down O
, O
and O
then O
they O
beat O
me O
on O
the O
face O
and O
head O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
it O
was O
; O
I O
wiped O
my O
face O
with O
my O
hand O
, O
my O
hand O
was O
full O
of O
blood O
, O
they O
had O
broken O
open O
my O
mouth O
. O
" O

Although O
the O
peasants O
' O
blocking O
the O
road O
was O
against O
the O
law O
, O
the O
police O
can O
maintain O
order O
according O
to O
the O
law O
, O

but O
what O
right O
do O
the O
police O
have O
to O
beat O
people O
and O
even O
to O
kick O
a O
woman O
in O
the O
stomach O
? O
" O

It O
also O
might O
be O
said O
that O
when O
a O
mob O
situation O
arises O
the O
police O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
clash O
with O
the O
people O
; O
most O
often O
the O
police O
are O
following O
orders O
to O
suppress O
the O
mob O
and O
help O
officials O
restore O
order O
. O

In O
life O
, O
some O
local O
government O
officials O
encounter O
problems O
of O
fierce O
resistance O
from O
the O
people O
; O
instead O
of O
thinking O
of O
ways O
to O
smooth O
over O
and O
resolve O
the O
problem O
, O
they O
first B-ORDINAL
think O
of O
suppressing O
it O
, O
and O
they O
're O
accustomed O
to O
mobilizing O
the O
police O
force O
to O
forcefully O
carry O
that O
out O
. O

In O
fact O
the O
harsher O
the O
suppression O
the O
more O
likely O
there O
will O
be O
a O
conflict O
, O
bringing O
on O
even O
greater O
feelings O
of O
opposition O
between O
police O
and O
people O
and O
between O
cadres O
and O
the O
masses O
, O
which O
does O
n't O
help O
resolve O
the O
problem O
. O

Taking O
this O
case O
as O
an O
example O
, O
the O
common O
folk O
blocked O
the O
road O
because O
the O
local O
government O
did O
not O
resolve O
the O
problem O
. O

If O
it O
had O
resolved O
it O
, O
no O
one O
would O
have O
broken O
the O
law O
! O

Although O
you O
can O
say O
that O
blocking O
the O
road O
was O
illegal O
, O
it O
's O
also O
not O
a O
violent O
act O
; O
the O
police O
should O
have O
continued O
directing O
traffic O
, O
and O
they O
might O
not O
have O
resorted O
so O
quickly O
to O
force O
. O

Who O
brought O
about O
the O
clash O
between O
the O
police O
and O
the O
villagers O
? O

Who O
bears O
responsibility O
?! O

I O
believe O
we O
should O
first B-ORDINAL
look O
into O
the O
local O
government O
's O
nonfeasance O
in O
ignoring O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
people O
. O

" O
The O
interests O
of O
the O
masses O
are O
no O
small O
matter O
" O
is O
not O
just O
a O
slogan O
; O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
made O
real O
. O

Now O
that O
there O
has O
been O
this O
disturbance O
, O
the O
concerned O
parties O
need O
to O
be O
vigilant O
; O
they O
take O
the O
initiative O
and O
pay O
compensation O
for O
the O
reinforcement O
work O
, O
sooner O
rather O
than O
later O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
very O
simple O
: O
people O
's O
homes O
, O
which O
were O
originally O
unstable O
, O
can O
still O
be O
maintained O
for O
several B-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
; O
this O
shock O
was O
n't O
caused O
by O
the O
people O
, O
and O
compensation O
should O
be O
paid O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
useless O
to O
quibble O
further O
about O
how O
much O
money O
should O
be O
spent O
on O
the O
compensation O
issue O
. O

I O
believe O
there O
is O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
standard O
: O
if O
someone O
's O
house O
was O
destroyed O
, O
the O
party O
who O
destroyed O
it O
should O
restore O
it O
to O
its O
original O
condition O
, O
without O
regard O
to O
how O
much O
money O
the O
damage O
is O
worth O
, O
afraid O
to O
spend O
one B-MONEY
red I-MONEY
cent I-MONEY
; O
just O
restore O
it O
to O
the O
original O
condition O
. O

If O
the O
wrangling O
over O
the O
compensation O
issue O
goes O
on O
forever O
, O
then O
I O
believe O
the O
government O
is O
still O
not O
sincere O
in O
resolving O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
people O
's O
interests O
; O
if O
it O
drags O
on O
and O
on O
, O
it O
will O
only O
intensify O
the O
conflict O
and O
make O
the O
people O
angry O
, O
and O
history O
will O
repeat O
itself O
. O

Do O
, O
keep O
bullying O
the O
peasants O
; O
they O
have O
it O
tough O
enough O
! O

The O
peasants O
have O
suffered O
enough O

Give O

In O

Mr. O

said O
the O
biggest O

was O
one O
of O
image O

Earlier B-DATE

, O
the O

Federal O

, O
though O
no O

So O
far O
they O
have O
issued O
scores O

subpoenas O

some O
of O
which O
went O
to O
members O
of O
the O

Mr. O

will O
have O
to O
face O
some O

the O
consequences O

those O
subpoenas O
. O

In O
a O
recent O
General B-ORG
Accounting I-ORG
Office I-ORG
study O
, O
the O
Merc B-ORG
was O
found O
to O
have O
been O
the O
most O
lax O
in O
enforcing O
exchange O
rules O
. O

It O
levied O
the O
smallest O
number O
of O
suspensions O
of O

and O
fines O
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
largest O
commodity O

studied O
over O
the B-DATE

It O
also O
had O
both O
the O
fewest O

and O
least O

per O

The O

received O
considerable O
criticism O
in O
1987 B-DATE
when O
it O
was O
discovered O
that O
its O

who O

`` O

according O
to O
a O
New B-GPE

Merc B-ORG
report O
prepared O
last B-DATE

. O

Mr. O
Conway B-PERSON
is O
no O
longer O
at O
the O

. O

`` O
We O
had O
a O
management O
breakdown O
in O
1987 B-DATE
in O
terms O
of O
compliance O
, O
'' O
Mr. O
Thompson B-PERSON
says O
. O

`` O
We O
recognized O
the O
problem O
and O
took O
care O
of O
it O
. O
'' O

He O
says O
that O
even O
if O
the O
natural O
gas O
contract O
boosts O
volume O
at O
the O
exchange O
strongly O
, O
the O
1990 B-DATE
business O
plan O
calls O
for O
having O
adequate O
compliance O
people O
to O
ensure O
that O
exchange O
rules O
are O
being O
followed O
. O

For O
years B-DATE
the O
five B-CARDINAL
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
exchanges O
have O
been O
talking O
about O
cooperating O
in O
various O
aspects O
of O
their O
business O
in O
order O
to O
improve O
the O
efficiency O
of O
their O
operations O
. O

Periodically O
, O
there O
has O
even O
been O
talk O
of O
mergers O
between O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
more O
exchanges O
. O

So O
far O
there O
is O
little O
to O
show O
for O
such O
efforts O
. O

Mr. O
Thompson B-PERSON
believes O
the O
case O
for O
working O
together O
is O
stronger O
now O
than O
ever O
. O

`` O
The O
cost O
of O
competition O
has O
become O
extremely O
high O
, O
'' O
he O
says O
. O

`` O
We O
must O
find O
ways O
to O
save O
money O
for O
the O

commission O

who O
do O

on O
our O
exchanges O
. O
'' O

He O
thinks O
that O
progress O
in O
cooperation O
can O
be O
made O
in O
areas O
where O
no O
vested O
interests O
have O
built O
up O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
areas O
is O
the O
development O
of O
a O

that O
would O
permit O

to O
enter O

The O
GAO B-ORG
has O
recommended O
the O
creation O
of O
a O

to O
record O

so O
that O
an O

The O

is O
now O
cooperating O
with O
the O
Comex B-ORG
in O
developing O
such O
a O
device O
to O
provide O
such O
an O
audit O

. O

The O
Chicago B-GPE
exchanges O
also O
are O
working O
on O
such O
a O
device O
. O

Another O
major O
electronics O
problem O
faces O
Mr. O
Thompson B-PERSON
-- O
the O
creation O
of O
a O

said O
the O

the O
best O
he O

He O
noted O
that O
for O

Prices O
this B-DATE

will O
likely O
be O
dominated O
by O
reports O
on O
the O
progress O
of O
the O
corn O

as O
well O
as O
by O
speculation O
about O
more O

of O
U.S. B-GPE
crops O
by O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
. O

In O
recent B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
warm O
and O
dry O
weather O
has O
sped O
the O
Midwest B-LOC
harvest O
and O
that O
is O
permitting O
farmers O
to O
rebuild O
the O
stockpiles O
that O
were O
cut O
by O
the O
1988 B-DATE
drought O
. O

If O
the O
weather O
allowed O
farmers O
to O
work O
in O
their O
fields O
over O
the B-DATE
weekend I-DATE
, O
many O
Midwest B-LOC

probably O
sell O

the B-ORG

Board I-ORG
of I-ORG

order O
to O
hedge O
their B-DATE

from O

. O

That O
selling O
of O
futures O
contracts O
by O
elevators O
is O
what O
helps O
keep O
downward O
pressure O
on O
crop O
prices O
during O
the O
harvest O
. O

Traders O
will O
also O
watch O
for O
whether O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE

continues O
its O
traditional O
fall O
buying O
of O

So O

bought O
about B-QUANTITY
7.2 I-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY

. O

There O
may O
be O
some O
activity O
in O

this B-DATE
week I-DATE
as O
investors O
try O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O

. O

Investors O
usually O
do O

want O
to O
take O
physical O
delivery O
of O
a O

preferring O
instead O
to O
profit O

then O
end O

be O
no O
simplicity O
, O
consequently O
I O
've O
become O
familiar O
not O
only O
with O
Cuban B-NORP
art O
and O
artists O
, O
but O
also O
with O
Cuban B-NORP
bureaucrats O
and O
their O
counterparts O
in O
our O
own O
government O
. O

Despite O
levels O
of O
obstruction O
, O
incompetence O
and O
ensuing O
frustration O
of O
mythic O
proportion O
, O
these O
projects O
all O
remain O
, O
in O
my O
mind O
, O
valuable O
and O
well O
worth O
the O
effort O
. O

There O
is O
a O
simple O
reason O
for O
this O
: O
the O
Cuban B-NORP
people O
. O

Let O
me O
immediately O
put O
limits O
to O
whatever O
nostalgic O
notions O
that O
may O
intimate O
. O

Those O
`` O
people O
'' O
to O
whom O
I O
refer O
are O
not O
some O
heroic O
, O
indecipherable O
quantity O
; O
they O
are O
artists O
, O
critics O
, O
taxi O
drivers O
, O
grandmothers O
, O
even O
some O
employees O
of O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Culture I-ORG
, O
all O
of O
whom O
share O
a O
deep O
belief O
in O
the O
original O
principles O
of O
the B-EVENT
Cuban I-EVENT
Revolution I-EVENT
, O
spelled O
out O
in O
terms O
such O
as O
equality O
among O
all O
members O
of O
the O
society O
, O
reverence O
for O
education O
and O
creative O
expression O
, O
universal O
rights O
to O
health O
and O
livelihood O
, O
housing O
, O
etc O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
generation O
of O
painters O
growing O
into O
maturity O
right O
now O
works O
with O
such O
profoundly O
held O
humanist O
assumptions O
and O
such O
passionate O
commitment O
to O
moral O
and O
ethical O
principles O
that O
it O
makes O
Che B-PERSON
Guevara I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
famous O
linkages O
of O
art O
, O
idealism O
and O
revolution O
seem O
modest O
. O

It O
is O
on O
behalf O
of O
these O
people O
, O
and O
out O
of O
my O
real O
respect O
for O
them O
, O
that O
I O
am O
responding O
to O
Mr. O
Asman B-PERSON
's O
opinions O
of O
their O
country O
. O

The O
Ochoa B-PERSON
trial O
in O
July B-DATE
, O
with O
its O
revelations O
of O
deeply O
rooted O
and O
widespread O
corruption O
, O
and O
the O
summary O
trial O
and O
execution O
, O
was O
extremely O
disturbing O
to O
everyone O
who O
has O
ever O
considered O
himself O
a O
friend O
of O
Cuba B-GPE
. O

However O
, O
unacceptable O
though O
those O
occurrences O
may O
have O
been O
, O
they O
still O
provide O
no O
excuse O
for O
wholesale O
departures O
from O
truth O
. O

Mr. O
Asman B-PERSON
should O
make O
distinctions O
among O
Fidel B-PERSON
, O
the O
army O
and O
the O
Cuban B-NORP
people O
. O

They O
are O
not O
interchangeable O
, O
since O
they O
are O
motivated O
to O
act O
based O
on O
their O
own O
circumstances O
. O

It O
is O
naivete O
to O
equate O
a O
government O
's O
policies O
with O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
-LRB- O
as O
we O
well O
know O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
it O
is O
even O
worse O
folly O
to O
merge O
the O
clearly O
divergent O
agendas O
of O
Fidel B-PERSON
and O
the O
military O
and O
the O
state O
bureaucracy O
. O

Mr. O
Asman B-PERSON
is O
also O
annoyed O
that O
Mr. O
Castro B-PERSON
has O
resisted O
collaboration O
with O
U.S. B-GPE
officials O
, O
even O
though O
by O
his O
own O
account O
that O
collaboration O
has O
been O
devised O
essentially O
as O
a O
mechanism O
for O
acts O
directly O
hostile O
to O
the O
Cuban B-NORP
regime O
, O
such O
as O
facilitating O
defections O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
a O
little O
disingenuous O
to O
be O
surprised O
that O
Fidel B-PERSON
does O
n't O
invite O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
to O
violate O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
Cuban B-NORP
government O
over O
its O
own O
territory O
. O

We O
badly O
need O
to O
follow O
fact O
rather O
than O
the O
rhetoric O
of O
conventional O
wisdom O
. O

Without O
this O
basic O
level O
of O
attention O
to O
reality O
, O
our O
policies O
on O
Cuba B-GPE
will O
continue O
to O
be O
as O
counterproductive O
as O
they O
have O
for O
30 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

From O
my O
own O
point O
of O
view O
, O
given O
the O
qualities O
of O
humanity O
, O
creativity O
and O
warm O
spirit O
in O
which O
the O
Cuban B-NORP
people O
excel O
, O
we O
deny O
ourselves O
access O
to O
things O
we O
hold O
dear O
, O

which O
seem O
to O
run O

the O

the O

question O
is O
: O
why O

What O
is O
the O
occasion O

Since O
last O

I O
have O
been O
receiving O
many O

asking O
why O
I O
publish O
in O
this O

inquiring O
why O
I O
insist O
on O
publishing O
in O
this O
newspaper O
, O
and O
the O
secret O
behind O
it O
. O

The O
letters O
intensified O
and O
became O
varied O
in O
how O
they O
flung O
sermons O
and O
religious O
images O
that O
have O
recently O
emerged O
, O
which O
are O
an O
organized O
campaign O
aimed O
at O
social O
unification O
and O
ripping O
apart O
the O
physical O
Arab B-NORP
structure O
of O
Muslims B-NORP
and O

; O
where O
we O
live O
together O
in O
unity O

the O
Arab B-NORP
World O
and O
abroad O
. O

Neither O
Arab B-NORP
countries O
nor O
our O
relationship O
with O
one O
another O
has O
made O
distinctions O
among O
the O
one O
people O

and O
the O

has O
not O
attacked O
us O

We O
united O
and O
never O
inquired O
: O
are O
you O
a O
Christian B-NORP
or O
a O
Muslim B-NORP
? O

That O
is O
what O
has O
materialized O
in O

in O
Lebanon B-GPE

and O
the O

Mr. O

His O
original O
strategy O

in O

a O
brilliant O

was O
to O

various O

to O

, O
as O
they O
had O
in O

Then O

would O
move O

It O
is O
still O
common O
to O
read O
in O

that O

10,000 B-CARDINAL

But O

He O

people O
to O
learn O
a O
new O
way O

The O
most O
important O
aspect O
in O
being O
your O
own O
psychiatrist O
is O
to O
learn O
to O
substitute O
the O
healthy O
way O
of O
thinking O
for O
the O
unhealthy O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O

For O
example O
, O
ask O
two B-CARDINAL
people O
to O
observe O
the O
same O
glass O
, O
if O
one O
notices O
a O
tiny O
speckle O
and O
the O
other O
notices O
the O
mild O
color O
, O
then O
the O
former O
's O
thinking O
pattern O
might O
be O
pessimistic O
, O
while O
the O
latter O
might O
be O
more O
sensitive O
to O
the O
positive O
aspect O
of O
things O
, O
which O
is O
a O
healthy O
and O
optimistic O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O

Thus O
, O
learn O
to O
observe O
the O
positive O
aspect O
of O
things O
has O
become O
an O
important O
training O
. O

To O
be O
your O
own O
psychiatrist O
, O
you O
should O
also O
learn O
to O
observe O
stress O
- O
related O
signs O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
stomachache O
, O
your O
normal O
response O
is O
to O
see O
a O
gastroenterologist O
. O

Through O
observation O
by O
" O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
eye O
, O
" O
you O
may O
see O
that O
the O
reason O
can O
be O
your O
new O
demanding O
boss O
. O

To O
be O
your O
own O
psychiatrist O
, O
you O
also O
need O
to O
learn O
appropriate O
knowledge O
. O

There O
was O
a O

Tsinghua I-ORG

, O
who O

troubled O
by O

depression O

some O
psychological O

he O
knew O
it O

, O
so O
he O
immediately O
sought O

some O

Psychological O
books O

Taking O
advantage O
of O
the B-EVENT
Chinese I-EVENT
New I-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
, O
many O
Taiwan B-GPE
businessmen O
working O
in O
the O
PRC B-GPE
returned O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
spend O
the O
holiday O
with O
their O

Just O
after O

, O
the B-ORG
Mainland I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG

and O
several O
non-governmental O
groups O
co-sponsored O
a O
seminar O
on O
economic O
relations O
with O
mainland O
China B-GPE

They O
invited O
a O
number O

Taiwan B-GPE
businessmen O
who O
were O
among O
the O
earliest O
to O
invest O
in O
the O
PRC B-GPE
to O
come O
to O
the O
seminar O

relate O
their O

At O
this O
event O
, O
there O
was O
virtually O
no O

The O

more O
concerned O
about O
choosing O
investment O
sites O

hiring O
mainland O

, O
and O
understanding O
customs O

You O
could O
privately O

: O
Is O
there O
likely O
to O
be O
any O
change O
in O
the O
cross-strait O
situation O
after O
the O
election O

Will O
the O
election O
affect O
willingness O

But O
you O
would O
only O
get O
responses O

relations O

A O

Maintaining O

the O
common O

When O

talk O
about O
21st B-DATE

leadership O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
cross-strait O
policy O
is O
the O
most O
serious O
subject O
that O
politicians O
must O
face O
, O
because O
it O
involves O
the O
very O
survival O

Taiwan B-GPE

, O
because O
this O
subject O
touches O
on O
the O
question O

the O
' O
loyalty O

of O
the O

toward O

it O

By O
looking O
at O
the O
carefully O
worded O
statements O
of O
the O
various O
candidates O
, O
he O
says O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
they O
are O
all O
afraid O
of O
being O
accused O
of O
" O
selling O
out O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O
" O

The O
only O
exception O
is O
the O
fringe O
candidate O
Li B-PERSON
Ao I-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
well O
- O
known O
for O
shooting O
from O
the O
hip O
. O

Unafraid O
of O
criticism O
that O
he O
is O
" O
betraying O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
" O
he O
has O
publicly O
endorsed O
the O
PRC B-GPE

policy O
of O
" O
one B-CARDINAL
country O

two B-CARDINAL
systems O

" O

The O
other O
minor O
candidate O
, O
Hsu B-PERSON

liang I-PERSON
, O
set O
the O
foundations O
for O
his O

policy O
as O
early O
as O
ten B-DATE

when O
he O
wrote O
a O
book O
on O
his O
theory O

" O

But O
neither O
of O
these O
views O
conform O
to O
mainstream O
values O
, O
and O
these O
candidates O
are O
getting O
little O
support O

What O
about O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
main O
candidates O
? O

Chen B-PERSON

bian I-PERSON
of O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Progressive I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
which O
advocates O
Taiwan B-GPE
independence O

a O
long O

detailed O
white O
paper O
on O
China B-GPE
policy O

which O
offered O
some O
changes O
and O
reservations O
to O
the O

position O

But O
, O
in O
an O
unguarded O
moment O
, O
Chen B-PERSON
also O
declared O
" O
Long O
live O
Taiwan B-GPE

independent O
sovereignty O
! O
" O
and O
this O
comment O
has O
left O
many O
people O
uncertain O
which O
is O
the O
real O
Chen B-PERSON
. O

Independent O
candidate O

James B-PERSON
Soong I-PERSON
has O
suggested O
defining O
Taiwan B-GPE
- O
PRC B-GPE
links O
as O
a O
" O
quasi-international O
relationship O
. O
" O

This O
aims O
for O
a O
middle O
ground O
between O
the O
KMT B-ORG
's O
" O
two B-CARDINAL
states O
formula O
" O
and O
the O
PRC B-GPE

" O
one B-CARDINAL
country O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
systems O
" O
that O
will O
appeal O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
mainland O
China B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
international O
community O
. O

But O
this O
idea O
has O
been O
criticized O
for O
unilaterally O
reducing O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
the O
status O
of O
a O
" O
quasi-country O
, O
" O
thereby O
weakening O
Taiwan B-GPE

status O
and O
bargaining O
power O

the O
mainland O
. O

Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
, O
candidate O
of O

ruling O
KMT B-GPE
, O
is O
somewhat O
bound O
to O
support O
the O
government O
's O
" O
two B-CARDINAL
states O
formula O
. O
" O

After O
much O
consideration O
, O
his O
mainland O
policy O
has O
been O
framed O
as O
working O
toward O
the O
middle O
stage O
of O
the B-LAW
National I-LAW
Reunification I-LAW
Guidelines I-LAW
- O
in O
other O
words O

to O
re-establish O
official O

" O
No O
one O
dares O
be O
different O
from O
the O
others O
on O
mainland O
policy O
, O
" O
says O
Wang B-PERSON
Chien I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chuang I-PERSON
. O

This O
is O
because O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
a O
consensus O
has O
taken O
shape O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
society O
on O
policy O
toward O
mainland O
China B-GPE
: O
" O
Taiwan B-GPE
first B-ORDINAL
. O
" O

No O
one O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
alter O
this O
consensus O
. O

The O
candidates O
can O
merely O
haggle O
over O
details O
of O
policy O
, O
such O
as O
differences O
over O
the O
scope O

Alexander B-PERSON
Lu I-PERSON
, O
a O
professor O
of O
political O
science O
at O
National B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
University I-ORG
, O
agrees O
with O
the O
no O
- O
major O
- O
innovations O
approach O
of O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
candidates O
. O

As O
he O
sees O
it O
, O
since O
currently O
there O
are O
three B-CARDINAL
candidates O
with O
a O
roughly O
equal O
share O
of O
the O
vote O
, O
whoever O
wins O
will O
probably O
not O
get O
more B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
50 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
there O
will O
be O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
countervailing O
pressure O
against O
radical O
change O
. O

Concludes O
Lu B-PERSON
: O
" O
Policy O
will O
tend O
to O
be O
centrist O
, O
and O
any O
steps O
taken O
will O
be O
small O
. O
" O

He O
adds O
, O
" O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
a O
pluralistic O
society O
, O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
attract O
many O
types O
of O
voters O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
be O
too O
outspoken O
about O
policy O
. O

This O
is O
because O
extreme O
clarity O
does O
n't O
make O
much O
difference O
to O
those O
who O
already O
support O
you O
, O
but O
it O
could O
cost O
you O
undecided O
votes O
. O
" O

Local O
issues O
, O
national O
results O

Mainland O
policy O
is O
a O
minefield O
, O
but O
it O
is O
the O
foundation O
for O
all O
other O
policies O
, O
and O
no O
candidate O
can O
ignore O
it O
. O

However O
, O
this O
does O
not O
mean O
, O
say O
Wang B-PERSON
and O
Lu B-PERSON
, O
that O
it O
will O
be O
a O
decisive O
factor O
in O
the O
election O
. O

" O
There O
is O
a O
very O
curious O
aspect O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
electoral O
culture O
, O
" O
explains O
Wang B-PERSON
. O

Taiwan B-GPE
is O
small O
, O
and O
voters O
do O
not O
clearly O
distinguish O
between O
the O
roles O
of O
the O
head O
of O
state O
, O
elected O
legislators O
, O
and O
government O
bureaucrats O
. O

No O
matter O
how O
high O
the O
office O
, O
for O
many O
voters O
, O
especially O
in O
traditional O
constituencies O
, O
" O
all O
politics O
is O
local O
. O
" O

For O
them O
, O
what O
matters O
is O
whether O
a O
politician O
seems O
concerned O
about O
their O
hometown O
issues O
. O

That O
is O
why O
when O
Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian I-PERSON
went O
to O
Sanhsia B-GPE
in O
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE
, O
he O
talked O
about O
a O
pension O
for O
the O
elderly O
, O
and O
when O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
went O
to O
Kaohsiung B-GPE
he O
talked O
about O
establishing O
a O
science O
- O
based O
industrial O
park O
there O
. O

These O
parochial O
issues O
are O
the O
real O
keys O
to O
the O
election O
. O

Next O
in O
importance O
is O
the O
candidate O

character O
, O
including O
charisma O

leadership O
style O

and O
attitude O
in O

James B-PERSON

says O
that O
controversy O
over O
James B-PERSON

goes O
back O
to O
the O
days O
when O
the O
KMT B-ORG
ruled O

repressed O

When O
Soong B-PERSON
was O
KMT B-ORG

he O
was O
powerful O
and O
aloof O
; O
the O
only O
way O
to O
get O

was O
to O
block O

In O

several O
such O

moments O
when O

For O

, O
he O
criticized O

over O
the O

assigned O
to O

at O

and O
also O
over O
unfairness O
in O
the O

His O

skills O
were O
such O
that O
" O
he O
only O

He O

refined O

But O
it O
is O
only O
actual O
governing O
that O
tests O
one O
's O
true O
staying O
power O
. O

Scholars O
have O
stated O
that O
the O
2000 B-DATE
election O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
three B-CARDINAL
special O
characteristics O
: O

For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
this O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
the O
opposition O
has O
a O
very O
real O
possibility O
of O
taking O
the O
reins O
of O
government O
. O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
leading O
candidates O
are O
so O
close O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
tell O
who O
will O
win O
. O

And O
third B-ORDINAL
, O
whatever O
the O
outcome O
, O
this O
is O
the O
beginning O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
post-strongman O
era O
. O

In O
this O
new O
era O
, O
says O
Wang B-PERSON
, O
new O
standards O
for O
leadership O
are O
needed O
. O

The O
national O
leader O
must O
be O
more O
than O
just O
a O
local O
politico O
writ O
large O
. O

Wang B-PERSON
gives O
his O
personal O
analysis O
of O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
for O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
candidates O
: O

Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian I-PERSON
is O
the O
person O
who O
brings O
the O
most O
hope O
and O
vitality O
, O
because O
his O
policies O
would O
be O
clearly O
different O
from O
those O
of O
the O
KMT B-ORG
. O

But O
his O
biggest O
problem O
is O
" O
instability O
" O
- O
not O
personal O
instability O
, O
but O
policy O
instability O
. O

For O
example O
, O
sometimes O
he O
seems O
opposed O
to O
allowing O
PRC B-GPE
firms O
to O
invest O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
sometimes O
in O
favor O
; O
sometimes O
he O
seems O
against O
the O
opening O
of O
direct O
links O
with O
the O
mainland O
, O
sometimes O
not O
. O

James B-PERSON
Soong I-PERSON
is O
very O
capable O
, O
but O
his O
very O
success O
may O
be O
his O
weak O
point O
. O

He O
is O
often O
very O
proud O
of O
himself O
because O
his O
provincial O
administration O
built O
a O
bridge O
or O
aqueduct O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
ordinary O
people O
. O

But O
, O
ancient O
Chinese B-NORP
governing O
wisdom O
criticizes O
those O
who O
" O
accomplish O
a O
small O
feat O
and O
think O
they O
can O
do O
anything O
, O
or O
discover O
a O
trivial O
idea O
and O
think O
they O
are O
brilliant O
. O
" O

Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
offers O
stability O
above O
all O
. O

But O
he O
carries O
a O
heavy O
burden O
. O

Lien B-PERSON
must O
face O
up O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
his O
party O
has O
been O
governing O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
for O
50 B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
people O
want O
change O
. O

Even O
if O
he O
wins O
, O
this O
may O
mean O
only O
that O
the O
people O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
are O
willing O
to O
give O
Lien B-PERSON
Chan I-PERSON
a O
chance O
, O
and O
would O
not O
necessarily O
be O
an O
endorsement O
of O
the O
KMT B-ORG
itself O
. O

Peace O
as O
a O
weapon O

What O
kinds O
of O
challenges O
face O
the O
next O
leader O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
? O

Public O
opinion O
surveys O
show O
that O
voters O
are O
most O
concerned O
about O
crime O
and O
the O
economy O
. O

In O
a O
February B-DATE
survey O
conducted O
by O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Daily I-ORG

, O
the O
number O
of O

31 B-PERCENT

, O
eleven B-PERCENT
percentage I-PERCENT

higher O

Roughly O
the O
same O
percentage O
said O
they O
were O
most O
concerned O
about O
problems O
of O

the O

Early B-DATE

Commonwealth B-ORG
magazine O
asked O
citizens O
, O
" O
What O
do O
you O
think O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
the O
new O
president O
should O
do O
after O
taking O
office O
? O
" O

The O
results O
show O
that O
the O
people O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
believe O
that O
the O
most O
urgent O
problems O
are O
crime O
, O
" O
black O
gold O
politics O
" O
-LRB- O
the O

, O
and O
raising O

. O

Senior O
journalist O
Chu B-PERSON
Sung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chiu I-PERSON
says O
that O
all O
three B-CARDINAL
major O
candidates O
say O
they O
are O
opposed O
to O
black O
gold O
politics O
. O

But O
citizens O
want O
more O
than O
slogans O
, O
they O
want O
effective O
action O
. O

Political O
scientist O
Alexander B-PERSON
Lu I-PERSON
says O
that O
the O
crux O
of O
the O
issue O
is O
resoluteness O
. O

If O
the O
resolve O
was O
there O
, O
it O
would O
not O
be O
that O
difficult O
to O
reduce O
crime O
and O
corruption O
. O

Ting B-PERSON
Chih I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
jen I-PERSON
says O
, O
" O
Crime O
is O
rising O
fastest O
among O
youth O
. O
" O

He O
argues O
that O
education O
is O
in O
fact O
the O
best O
crime O
- O
fighting O
policy O
: O

" O
If O
students O
can O
enjoy O
a O
happy O
learning O
environment O
at O
school O
, O
then O
society O
will O
no O
longer O
be O
sitting O
on O
a O
powderkeg O
. O
" O

Ting B-PERSON
says O
that O
, O
although O
education O
is O
not O
a O
panacea O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
not O
irrelevant O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
effects O
of O
education O
policy O
are O
visible O
only O
in O
the O
long O
term O
, O
and O
it O
therefore O
has O
a O
relatively O
weak O
position O
in O
politics O
and O
is O
often O
neglected O
because O
policymakers O
probably O
will O
not O
see O
the O
fruits O
of O
their O
efforts O
in O
their O
terms O
of O
office O
. O

But O
the O
main O
industries O
of O
the B-DATE
21st I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
such O
as O
the O
information O
and O
telecommunications O
industries O
, O
are O
knowledge O
- O
based O
. O

If O
education O
is O
done O
well O
, O
the O
benefits O
will O
spread O
to O
many O
other O
areas O
. O

The O
greatest O
variable O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
society O
remains O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
. O

" O
In O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
been O
continually O
testing O
where O
mainland O
China B-GPE
will O
draw O
the O
line O
in O
cross-strait O
relations O
, O
" O
says O
social O
critic O
Nan B-PERSON
Fang I-PERSON
Shuo I-PERSON
. O

But O
playing O
word O
games O
over O
how O
to O
define O
the O
relationship O
is O
simply O
a O
way O
of O
hiding O
from O
the O
problem O
, O
ostrich O
- O
like O
, O
as O
the O
situation O
deteriorates O
. O

Fortunately O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
main O
candidates O
have O
committed O
themselves O
to O
a O
moderate O
path O
. O

Right O
now O
there O
's O
a O
choice O
between O
peace O
and O
war O
in O
cross-strait O
relations O
. O

The O
most O
important O
challenge O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
now O
is O
to O
transcend O
the O
old O
mentalities O
of O
cold O
war O
anti-communism O
and O
Taiwan B-GPE
independence O
, O
and O
to O
build O
a O
new O
logic O
of O
peace O
. O

Taiwan B-GPE
's O
future O
is O
now O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
its O
voters O

refueling O
speculation O
that O
Kidder B-ORG

getting O

Mr. O
Carpenter B-PERSON
denies O
the O
speculation O

To O
answer O
the O

question O
, O
Kidder B-ORG
, O
in O
typical O
fashion O
, O
completed O
a O
task O

The O
result O
: O
Kidder B-ORG
will O
focus O
on O
rich O
individual O
investors O

small O
companies O
, O
much O
closer O
to O
the O

Shearson B-ORG
Lehman I-ORG
Hutton I-ORG

. O

Mr. O
Carpenter B-PERSON
notes O
that O
these O
types O
of O
investors O
also O
are O
`` O
sophisticated O
'' O
enough O
not O
to O
complain O
about O
Kidder B-ORG

aggressive O
use O
of O

trading O
. O

As O
part O
of O
the O
upscale O
push O
, O
Kidder B-ORG
is O
putting O
brokers O
through O
a O
20 B-DATE

week I-DATE
training O

, O
turning O
them O
into O
`` O

They O
will O
get O
`` O
new O

particularly O
to O
the O
affluent O
investor O
, O
'' O
says O
brokerage O
chief O
Charles B-PERSON
V. I-PERSON
Sheehan I-PERSON
. O

Theoretically O
, O
the O
brokers O
will O
then O
be O
able O
to O
funnel O
`` O
leads O
'' O
on O
corporate O
finance O
opportunities O
to O
Kidder B-ORG

investment O
bankers O
, O
possibly O
easing O
the O
longstanding O
tension O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
camps O
. O

However O
, O
skeptics O
caution O
that O
this O
kind O
of O
cross-pollination O
between O
brokers O
and O
investment O
bankers O
looks O
great O
on O
paper O
, O
but O
does O
n't O
always O
happen O
. O

Kidder B-ORG
competitors O
are O
n't O
outwardly O
hostile O
to O
the O

, O
as O
many O
are O
to O
a O
tough O

that O

was O
that O
um O

that O
these O

that O

, O
any O

ah O

ah O
, O
if O
they O
get O

in O
the O

, O
it O
might O
, O
eh O
, O
result O
in O
the O

leading O
to O
no O
positive O

. O

What O
is O
its O
goal O

It O
is O
that O
at O

a O
concrete O

result O

Uh-huh O
. O

to O
that O

, O
eh O
, O
it O
has O
put O

a O

, O
in O
it O

it O

them O

how O

the O

task O
. O

On O

24 I-DATE
, O
just O
days O
after O
the O
ROC B-GPE
presidential O
election O
, O
the B-ORG
Council I-ORG

made O

, O
declaring O
the O

This O
stirred O
the O
ire O
of O
National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
members O
, O
who O
struck O
back O
during O
the O
ensuing O
constitutional O
revision O
session O
, O
claiming O
that O
" O
lifelong O

violate O

" O

The O
reaction O
by O
a O
minority O
of O
NA B-ORG
delegates O
to O
the O
grand O
justices O
' O
constitutional O
interpretation O
once O
again O
triggered O
displeasure O
in O
society O
at O
the O
body O
's O
refusal O
to O
admit O
its O
fallibility O
. O

Activists O
in O
groups O
such O
as O
the B-ORG
Taipei I-ORG
Society I-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
Association I-ORG
of I-ORG
Taiwanese I-ORG
University I-ORG
Professors I-ORG
organized O
a O
street O
demonstration O
to O
call O
for O
the O
dissolution O
of O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
. O

A O
further O
consequence O
of O
the O
grand O
justices O
' O
ruling O
was O
that O
an O
election O
would O
have O
to O
be O
held O
to O
produce O
a O
new O
National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
membership O
before O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
current O
term O
. O

While O
this O
development O
had O
would O
- O
be O
candidates O
in O
all O
parties O
scrambling O
to O
launch O
election O
campaigns O
, O
by O
late B-DATE
March I-DATE
the O
post-presidential-election O
situation O
, O
combined O
with O
pressure O
from O
public O
opinion O
, O
pushed O
the O
KMT B-ORG
to O
work O
with O
the O
DPP B-ORG
on O
means O
to O
phase O
out O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
, O
despite O
the O
KMT B-ORG
's O
previous O
opposition O
to O
the O
body O
's O
complete O
dissolution O
in O
the O
name O
of O
preserving O
the O
constitutional O
structure O
. O

For O
a O
time O
, O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
to O
hold O
elections O
for O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
DPP B-ORG
and O
KMT B-ORG
's O
shared O
policy O
for O
phasing O
out O
the O
body O
, O
were O
viewed O
as O
motivated O
by O
fear O
of O
the O
growth O
of O
the B-ORG
People I-ORG
First I-ORG
Party I-ORG
-LRB- O
PFP B-ORG
-RRB- O
. O

Thus O
the O
hubbub O
continued O
over O
the O
fate O
of O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
for O
a O
fortnight O
, O
until O
finally O
the O
newly O
formed O
PFP B-ORG
caucus O
in O
the O
assembly O
agreed O
to O
its O
gradual O
downsizing O
. O

This O
paved O
the O
way O
for O
the O
commencement O
on O
April B-DATE
8 I-DATE
of O
the O
sixth B-ORDINAL
round O
of O
constitutional O
revisions O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
in O
which O
such O
issues O
as O
reducing O
the O
total O
number O
of O
NA B-ORG
delegates O
and O
freezing O
their O
powers O
and O
duties O
- O
amounting O
to O
their O
" O
self O
- O
abolition O
" O
- O
became O
the O
center O
of O
discussion O
. O

The O
various O
parties O
leveraged O
their O
carrots O
and O
sticks O
against O
their O
delegates O
, O
threatening O
expulsion O
for O
not O
supporting O
the O
neutralization O
of O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
they O
tried O
to O
appease O
their O
delegates O
. O

Finally O
, O
on O
April B-DATE
24 I-DATE
these O
maneuvers O
helped O
bring O
about O
the O
passage O
of O
several O
constitutional O
revisions O
, O
including O
deactivation O
of O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
, O
favorable O
provisions O
for O
residents O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
offshore O
islands O
-LRB- O
Kinmen B-LOC
, O
Matsu B-LOC
, O
and O
Penghu B-LOC
-RRB- O
and O
military O
personnel O
, O
and O
revocation O
of O
lifelong O
special O
privileges O
for O
grand O
justices O
. O

In O
line O
with O
these O
revisions O
, O
the O
voting O
public O
will O
no O
longer O
directly O
elect O
NA B-ORG
delegates O
. O

Rather O
, O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
will O
become O
a O
" O
task O
- O
based O
body O
" O
generated O
according O
to O
proportional O
political O
party O
representation O
in O
the O
legislature O
, O
maintaining O
the O
rights O
to O
ratification O
of O
constitutional O
revisions O
proposed O
by O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
, O
impeachment O
of O
the O
president O
and O
vice O
president O
, O
and O
resolutions O
on O
modifications O
to O
national O
territory O
. O

With O
these O
changes O
, O
legislators O
will O
exercise O
approval O
over O
personnel O
appointments O
to O
the O
Judicial B-ORG
, O
Examination B-ORG
and O
Control B-ORG
yuans I-ORG
. O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
does O
have O
its O
unique O
set O
of O
duties O
and O
powers O
under O
the O
existing O
structure O
, O
thus O
few O
people O
are O
ready O
to O
call O
for O
its O
complete O
abolition O
. O

This O
is O
especially O
notable O
given O
the O
ambiguity O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
constitutional O
structure O
, O
seeing O
as O
it O
is O
not O
a O
presidential O
system O
, O
a O
cabinet O
system O
, O
or O
a O
two B-CARDINAL
- O
headed O
system O
in O
the O
true O
sense O
. O

Many O
scholars O
caution O
that O
eliminating O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
and O
handing O
all O
its O
powers O
to O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
, O
while O
the O
government O
structure O
remains O
ambiguous O
, O
is O
not O
the O
best O
structural O
framework O
. O

That O
said O
, O
despite O
landmark O
changes O
such O
as O
the O
full O
election O
of O
the O
national O
parliament O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
and O
establishment O
of O
the O
legal O
groundwork O
for O
the O
direct O
election O
of O
the O
ROC B-GPE
president O
, O
the B-LAW
ROC I-LAW
Constitution I-LAW
has O
been O
revamped O
with O
alarming O
frequency O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

In O
fact O
, O
some O
have O
scoffed O
that O
the O
constitution O
, O
the O
basis O
upon O
which O
the O
nation O
's O
laws O
are O
founded O
, O
has O
been O
tinkered O
with O
more O
often O
than O
the O
civil O
and O
criminal O
codes O
. O

Further O
, O
new O
duties O
and O
authorities O
were O
given O
to O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
in O
order O
to O
achieve O
successive O
constitutional O
revisions O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
exchange O
for O
the O
assembly O
agreeing O
to O
give O
up O
its O
authority O
to O
elect O
the O
president O
, O
the O
body O
was O
given O
power O
of O
approval O
over O
personnel O
appointments O
to O
the O
Judicial B-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
, O
Examination B-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
, O
and O
Control B-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
. O

With O
each O
revision O
, O
the O
constitution O
became O
increasingly O
jumbled O
, O
while O
NA B-ORG
delegates O
leveraged O
their O
positions O
to O
exact O
" O
constitutional O
amendment O
rent O
" O
and O
fatten O
themselves O
up O
. O

Last B-DATE
year I-DATE
's I-DATE
term O
extension O
bill O
further O
solidified O
the O
public O
's O
image O
of O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
as O
no O
more O
than O
a O
tool O
of O
political O
struggle O
, O
and O
a O
self O
- O
indulgent O
body O
at O
that O
, O
generating O
widespread O
consensus O
on O
the O
necessity O
of O
dissolving O
it O
. O

While O
the O
latest O
round O
of O
constitutional O
revisions O
satisfies O
the O
general O
desire O
across O
the O
political O
spectrum O
to O
progressively O
dismantle O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
, O
sloppy O
accompanying O
provisions O
and O
the O
failure O
of O
the O
various O
political O
parties O
to O
propose O
a O
new O
blueprint O
in O
its O
place O
provide O
cause O
for O
new O
concern O
over O
the O
health O
of O
constitutional O
government O
in O
the O
ROC B-GPE
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
will O
become O
a O
" O
task O
- O
based O
body O
" O
generated O
according O
to O
the O
proportion O
of O
seats O
held O
by O
each O
political O
party O
in O
the O
legislature O
. O

National B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
University I-ORG
professor O
Lee B-PERSON
Hung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
hsi I-PERSON
, O
an O
expert O
on O
constitutional O
law O
, O
points O
out O
that O
less B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
10 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
population O
takes O
part O
in O
political O
party O
activities O
. O

Thus O
a B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
generated O
proportionally O
according O
to O
party O
representation O
represents O
suppression O
of O
the O
views O
of O
the B-PERCENT
other I-PERCENT
90 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
population O
, O
and O
thus O
violates O
the O
principle O
of O
vesting O
authority O
over O
constitutional O
government O
in O
the O
people O
. O

Following O
the O
demobilization O
of O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
, O
many O
functions O
and O
powers O
currently O
held O
by O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
will O
be O
transferred O
to O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
. O

This O
in O
turn O
raises O
fears O
in O
the O
academic O
community O
that O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
could O
become O
an O
untamable O
new O
constitutional O
monster O
. O

The O
expanded O
powers O
of O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
also O
include O
the O
impeachment O
and O
recall O
of O
the O
president O
and O
vice O
president O
, O
and O
the O
supplementary O
election O
of O
the O
vice O
president O
. O

These O
changes O
tighten O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
parliament O
and O
the O
president O
, O
requiring O
the O
president O
to O
report O
to O
the B-ORG
Legislative I-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
on O
the O
state O
of O
the O
nation O
. O

But O
the O
president O
has O
only O
the O
passive O
authority O
to O
dissolve O
the O
parliament O
. O

In O
the O
face O
of O
a O
parliament O
with O
supreme O
powers O
, O
a O
president O
whose O
party O
claims O
only O
a O
minority O
in O
the O
legislature O
is O
powerless O
even O
to O
replace O
a O
premier O
with O
whom O
he O
does O
not O
see O
eye O
to O
eye O
, O
leaving O
him O
devoid O
of O
the O
authorities O
and O
responsibilities O
to O
correspond O
with O
his O
administrative O
actions O
. O

A O
China B-ORG
Times I-ORG
editorial O
urged O
that O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
the O
enormous O
Legislative B-ORG
Yuan I-ORG
might O
be O
split O
into O
two B-CARDINAL
houses O
by O

be O

The O

the O

The O

They O
note O
that O
most O

will O
come O
on O

in O
1992 B-DATE
, O
when O
the O

`` O

`` O

He O
does O
add O

however O
, O
that O

instead O

That O
trend O
could O
increase O
demand O
for O
hot O

The O

is O
one O

the O

already O

this O
marks O
the O

called O

it O

The O
company O
said O
it O
does O
n't O
expect O
the O

capacity O
to O
adversely O
affect O
the O
company O
's O
existing O
hot O

lines O
. O

Steelmakers O
have O
also O
been O
adding O
capacity O
of O
so O

called O
electrogalvanized O
steel O
, O
which O
is O
another O
way O
to O
make O
coated O
corrosion O

resistant O
steel O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
advantages O
of O
the O
hot O

dipped O
process O
is O
that O
it O
allows O
the O
steel O
to O
be O
covered O
with O
a O
thicker O

more O
quickly O

yesterday B-DATE

fiery O
controversy O
on O
religious O
tolerance O

cultural O
conformity O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
Kingdom I-GPE
, O
when O
he O
said O
that O
it O
was O
the O
duty O
of O
all O
immigrants O
to O
integrate O
into O
British B-NORP
society O
. O

He O
was O
speaking O
in O

of O
invitees O
to O
his O
office O
at O
10 B-LOC
Downing I-LOC
Street I-LOC
in O
London B-GPE
and O
said O
, O
" O
The O
immigrant O
's O
right O
to O
live O
within O
a O
multicultural O

is O
always O
balanced O
by O
his O
duty O

Asian B-NORP
British B-NORP

black O
British B-NORP

or O
white O
British B-NORP

" O

He O
added O
that O
" O
Christians B-NORP
, O
Jews B-NORP
, O
Muslims B-NORP
, O
Hindus B-NORP
, O
Sikhs B-NORP
, O
and O
people O

the O

" O
This O
is O
exactly O
what O
we O
mean O
when O
we O
describe O
Britain B-GPE
as O
a O
multicultural O

multi-faith O
society O

" O

He O
defended O
his O
government O

call O
to O
open O
a O
debate O
on O
extremism O
after O
the O
London B-GPE
bombings O
in O
2005 B-DATE
, O
in O
order O
to O
determine O
the O
motives O
of O
the O
Muslim B-NORP
youth O
in O
executing O
such O

. O

He O
stated O
that O
extremism O
" O
is O
not O
confined O
to O
Muslims B-NORP
, O
as O
experience O
has O
taught O
us O
in O
Northern B-GPE
Ireland I-GPE
and O
from O
some O
elements O
in O

" O

" O
So O
when O
we O
speak O
about O
combating O
extremism O
, O
we O
do O
not O
mean O
the O
whole O
Muslim B-NORP
community O
, O
but O
elements O
of O
it O
. O
" O

He O
explained O
that O
, O
" O
Extremism O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
for O
British B-NORP
people O
of O
Hindu B-NORP
, O
African B-NORP
, O
Caribbean B-NORP
, O
Chinese B-NORP
, O
or O
Polish B-NORP
origins O
. O

It O
is O
also O
not O
considered O
a O
problem O
related O
to O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
Muslim B-NORP
community O
, O
because O
that O
majority O
is O
law O
- O
abiding O
and O
is O
proud O
to O
be O
Muslim B-NORP
of O
British B-NORP
nationality O
. O

It O
is O
a O
problem O
with O
a O
minority O
of O
that O
community O
, O
particularly O
those O
originating O
from O
certain O
countries O

So O
tell O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
the O
day O
she O
was O
born O
. O

When O
did O
you O
first O
see O
her O
? O

%um O
what O
happened O
is O
we O
went O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O

she O
was O
induced O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
we O
get O
a O
phone O
call O

and O
th- O
, O
she O
was O
supposed O
to O
Right O
finally O
. O
%um O
the O
birth O
mom O
was O
supposed O
to O
go O
in O
at O
%um O
, O
it O
's O
my O
thinking O
that O
this O
will O
be O
distributed O
publicly O
. O
Right O
. O
at O
%um O
six B-TIME
thirty I-TIME
in O
the O
morning O

but O
she O
called O

and O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
beds O
. O

oh O
no O
. O

So O
she O
called O
us O
and O
told O
us O
that O
, O

but O
then O
they O
did O
get O
a O
bed O

and O
she O
went O
in O
at O
eight B-TIME
. O
mhm O
. O
Or O
seven B-TIME
thirty I-TIME
or O
, O

I O
guess O
she O
went O
in O
at O
seven B-TIME
thirty I-TIME

and O
they O
started O
her O
at O
eight B-TIME
or O

so O
so O
we O
hopped O
in O
the O
car O
and O
drove O
down O
to O
be O
there O
mhm O
. O
%mm O
mhm O
. O
for O
the O
day O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
%um O
, O
we O
hung O
out O
all O
day O
. O

We O
had O
%uh O
we O
had O
some O
difficult O
times O
with O
the O
lawyer O
down O
there O
. O

He O
was O
supposed O
to O
show O
up O

%mm O

mhm O
. O

and O
we O
waited O
all O
day O

and O
he O
never O
bloody O
showed O
up O
. O

oh O
no O
. O

And O
%um O
, O
he O
and O
also O
she O
was O
expecting O
him O
too O
. O
mhm O
. O
You O
know O

and O
so O
that O
was O
frustrating O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
anyway O
we O
waited O
all O
day O

and O
%um O
But O
then O
five B-TIME
twenty I-TIME
five I-TIME
Mae B-PERSON
was O
born O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
the O
birth O
mother O
's O
mother O
was O
with O
her O
through O
the O
whole O
thing O

and O
she O
was O
fantastic O
. O

She O
was O
just O
great O
. O

She O
was O
so O
nice O
to O
us O
and O
so O
solid O
there O
for O
her O
daughter O
and O
just O
a O
wonderful O
uh-huh O
. O
mhm O
. O
Woman O
person O

and O
%um O
She O
was O
great O
. O

She O
came O
out O
, O
you O
know O
, O
a O
couple O
times O
during O
the O
day O

she O
came O
out O
and O
gave O
us O
little O
progress O
reports O
of O
how O
things O
were O
going O

and O
actually O
it O
was O
very O
funny O
uh-huh O
. O
because O
the O
first O
time O
she O
out O
, O

I O
mean O
here O
we O
're O
out O
there O
sort O
of O
ringing O
our O
hands O
and O
uh-huh O

sweating O
it O
out O
and O
wondering O
how O
everybody O
is O
going O
and O
everything O

and O
she O
came O
out O

and O
could O
I O
go O
downstairs O
because O
%um O
, O
her O
daughter O
wanted O
playing O

So O
I O
guess O
she O
was O
bored O

uh-huh O
. O

You O
know O
passing O
the O
time O

So O
I O
went O
downstairs O

wanted O
some O
chewing O

mouth O
gets O
dry O

and O
you O
just O
want O
something O

it O
was O

it O
was O
kind O
of O
funny O
these O
very O

Reassuring O

a O
way O
I O

. O

And O
%um O
, O
then O
but O
they O
kind O
of O
held O
her O
back O
. O

I O
think O
the O
baby O
would O
've O
born O
, O
been O
born O
sooner O

but O
the O
doctor O
did O
n't O
get O
there O
till O
around B-TIME
three I-TIME
. O

So O

so O
I O
thought O
once O
it O
was O
induced O
there O
was O
like O
no O
stopping O
it O
. O

No O
they O
can O
hold O
you O
back O
%hm O
. O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
you O
know O
. O

%hm O
. O

Once O
, O

depends O
how O
much O
stuff O
they O
give O
you O
. O

How O
much O
stuff O
they O
give O
you O
. O

yeah O
. O

Stuff O
. O

But O
anyway O
I O
think O
they O
were O
holding O
her O
back O
a O
little O
bit O
because O
they O
wanted O
the O
doctor O
there O
. O

mhm O

uh-huh O
. O

%um O
, O
and O
the O
doctor O
showed O
up O
around B-TIME
three I-TIME

and O
Mae B-PERSON
was O
born O
at O
five B-TIME
twenty I-TIME
five I-TIME
. O

mhm O
. O

Eight B-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
eight I-QUANTITY
ounces I-QUANTITY
. I-QUANTITY

mhm O
. O

And O
screaming O
. O

mhm O
. O

Really O
screaming O

and O
I O
was O
a O
little O
scared O
. O

I O
thought O
oh O
my O
god O
what O
have O
we O
wrought O
. O

You O
could O
here O
her O
out O
through O
the O
doors O
of O
the O
hall O
, O
you O
know O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
there O
were O
a O
lot O
of O
babies O
being O
born O
. O

You O
did O
n't O
hear O
them O
all O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
I O
, O

and O
%um O
, O
what O
happened O
h- O
, O

I O
guess O
%um O
, O

that O
's O
right O
. O

Her O
mom O
came O
running O
out O
to O
tell O
us O
the O
baby O
was O
born O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
then O
she O
said O
that O
's O
her O
. O

You O
can O
hear O
her O

And O
%um O
, O
said O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
birth O
. O

I O
mean O
two B-CARDINAL
pushes O
and O
she O
was O
out O
which O
is O
really O
great O

so O
she O
's O
very O
unsquashed O
and O
unbattered O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
baby O
. O

uh-huh O
mhm O
. O

Right O
. O

Usually O
they O
look O
a O
bit O
bashed O
up O
. O

yeah O
. O

A O
bit O
worn O
. O

But O
she O
's O
got O
a O
nice O
shaped O
head O

and O
, O
you O
know O
she O
does O
n't O
look O
like O
she O
was O
%um O
, O

you O
know O
she O
's O
not O
a O
cone O
head O
. O

mhm O
. O

But O
did O
you O
get O
to O
see O
her O
in O
a B-TIME
few I-TIME
hours I-TIME

or O

a- O

Well O
what O
happened O

no O

right O
away O
there O
, O
there O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
%um O
delivery O
nurse O
who O
we O
had O
spoken O
to O
earlier O
in O
the O
day O
named O
Tina B-PERSON
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
what O
they O
do O
is O
they O
take O
the O
baby O
from O
the O
delivery O
room O
to O
the O
nursery O
. O

mhm O
. O

Normally O
they O
go O
directly O

and O
Tina B-PERSON
very O
, O
very O
sweetly O
zipped O
past O
the O
door O
to O
the O
out O
, O
outer O
part O
of O
the O
nursery O
where O
we O
were O
waiting O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
outside O
mhm O
. O
and O
let O
us O
hold O
her O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
she O
was O
just O
minutes O
old O
then O
. O

Wow O
. O

So O
we O
held O
her O
for O
just O
a O
couple B-TIME
minutes I-TIME

and O
uh-huh O
. O
it O
was O
really O
funny O
because O
you O
could O
hear O
her O
coming O
up O
the O
hall O
screaming O
uh-huh O
. O
loudly O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

. O

She O
handed O
her O
to O
me O
screaming O
loudly O

and O
I O
said O
to O
Tina B-PERSON
and O
also O
to O
the O
, O
uh-huh O
. O
the O
birth O
mother O
's O
mother O
there O
, O
you O
know O
oh O
Robert B-PERSON
has O
the O
magic O
touch O
. O

I O
handed O
her O
to O
Robert B-PERSON
. O

Instant O
silence O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Instant O
. O

She O
just O
stopped O
screaming O
immediately O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

So O
he O
held O
her O
for O
a O
little O
while O
. O

And O
then O
the O
nurse O
was O
afraid O
to O
take O
her O
back O
. O

Said O
oh O
she O
's O
going O
to O
scream O
again O
. O

uh- O
uh-huh O
. O

And O
she O
did O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
off O
they O
went O
to O
the O
nursery O

and O
then O
you O
watched O
through O
the O
glass O

That O
must O
have O
been O
very O
reassuring O
for O
Robert B-PERSON
. O

It O
was O
very O
nice O
was O
n't O
it O
. O

It O
was O
very O
wonderful O
for O
Robert B-PERSON
and O
for O
me O
too O
just O
to O
see O
, O

I O
knew O
it O
would O
work O
too O
. O

Very O
nice O
. O

yeah O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
is O
. O

He O
has O
some O
, O

you O
have O
a O
theory O
. O

Body O
warmth O
or O
something O

but O
anyway O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
partly O
it O

but O
there O
're O
certain O
kind O
of O
men O
who O
, O

I O
think O
it O
's O
men O
who O
have O
like O
these O
big O

I O
have O
this O
theory O
that O
it O
's O
men O
who O
are O
very O
broad O
right O
under O
the O
elbow O
you O
know O
like O
, O

Wait O
a O
minute O
. O

Broad O
under O
the O
elbow O
. O

You O
mean O
in O
the O
chest O
? O

like O

No O
. O

From O
the O
elbow O
down O
towards O
the O
wrist O
. O

oh O
. O

Who O
have O
like O
these O
big O
broad O
forearms O
. O

I O
think O
babies O
like O
that O
. O

You O
think O
it O
gives O
, O
it O
gives O
security O
. O

I O
suppose O
. O

Do O
you O
remember O
Otto B-PERSON
who O
moved O
my O
filing O
cabinet O
that O
time O
in O
Philadelphia B-GPE

he O
's O
another O
one O
? O
Yes O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
yeah O
. O
He O
's O
big O
. O
He O
's O
sort O
of O
solid O
to O
me O
. O
who O

He O
's O
sort O
of O
very O
solid O

and O
they O
just O
love O
it O
. O

But O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
not O
big O
like O
that O
. O

No O
, O

but O
he O
, O
but O
Robert B-PERSON
is O
big O
below O
the O
elbows O
I O
'll O
bet O
if O
you O
check O
. O

I O
'll O
have O
to O
check O
out O
below O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
elbows O

At O
any O
rate O
, O
%um O

So O
that O
was O
nice O

and O
then O
we O
watched O
through O
the O
nursery O
while O
they O
do O
, O

if O
you O
survive O
the O
first O
four O
hours O
of O
life O
in O
the O
nursery O
you O
'll O
survive O
anything O
after O
. O

It O
's O
the O
most O
sort O
of O
appalling O
introduction O
to O
life O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
I O
was O
kind O
of O
scared O
at O
that O
point O
because O
we O
're O
looking O
in O
and O
there O
're O
all O
these O
nice O
sweet O
little O
pale O
babies O
lying O
there O
limp O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
there O
's O
Mae B-PERSON

and O
she O
's O
big O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O

and O
she O
was O
bright O
red O

and O
she O
is O
screaming O

and O
she O
screamed O

and O
she O
screamed O

and O
she O
screamed O

and O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
them O
as O
soon O
as O
they O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Um O
- O
huh O

uh-huh O

they O
sort O
of O
get O
exhausted O
after O
two B-CARDINAL
screams O
and O
collapse O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
she O
was O
healthy O
I O
guess O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
she O
just O
screamed O
and O
screamed O
and O
screamed O
and O
screamed O
and O
screamed O

and O
I O
thought O
oh O
my O
god O
what O
have O
we O
wrought O
here O
. O

Did O
they O
tell O
you O
her O
apgar O
or O
whatever O
they O
call O
that O
? O

How O

They O
did O
n't O
tell O
us O
anything O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
at O
the O
hospital O
they O
were O
n't O
the O
, O
there O
were O
someth- O
, O
the O
individual O
people O
we O
had O
contact O
with O
were O
, O
were O
decent O
to O
us O
and O
friendly O

Were O
nice O
. O

but O
%um O
the O
hospital O
policy O
was O
rather O
unfriendly O
to O
us O

and O
they O
would O
n't O
, O

like O
we O
had O
been O
told O
, O

we O
they O
have O
a O
room O
called O
the O
bonding O
room O

yeah O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
the O
whole O
purpose O
of O
the O
room O
is O
to O
let O
people O
be O
in O
it O
with O
the O
baby O
, O
who O
-- O
uh-huh O
. O
-- O
are O
going O
to O
be O
with O
the O
baby O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
they O
would O
n't O
let O
us O
in O
there O

so O
, O
%mm O
. O
d- O
, O
it O
was O
really O
quite O
awful O
. O

They O
would O
n't O
let O
us O
, O

they O
did O
n't O
, O

they O
they O
gave O
us O

but O
they O
did O
n't O
tell O
us O
beans O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
they O
really O
did O
n't O
talk O
to O
us O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
offer O
us O
that O
parenting O
class O
that O
they O
offer O
to O
most O
people O
. O

mhm O
. O

We O
would O
have O
had O
to O
come O
back O
the O
next O
day O
to O
the O
hospital O
which O
of O
course O
we O
were O
n't O
going O
to O
do O
. O

%hm O
. O

mhm O
. O

%um O
, O
you O
know O
they O
really O
were O
n't O
very O
nice O

and O
yeah O
. O
I O
guess O
they O
have O
, O

their O
rules O
are O
just O
very O
rigid O
. O

%mm O
. O

And O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
lawyer O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
arranged O
for O
%um O
Right O
. O
an O
additional O
bracelet O
. O

mhm O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
what O
happens O
is O
they O
put O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
the O
wrist O
of O
the O
baby O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
the O
ankle O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
the O
birth O
mother O

and O
then O
she O
has O
a O
, O
what O
you O
call O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
bracelet O
which O
she O
can O
give O
to O
whoever O
will O
be O
her O
coach O
through O
the O
birth O
and O
stuff O

and O
of O
course O
she O
had O
given O
it O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
%hm O
. O
mhm O
. O
%hm O
. O
I O
see O
. O
I O
see O
. O
which O
makes O
perfect O
sense O
. O

mhm O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
only O
way O
, O

they O
could O
n't O
get O
their O
minds O
around O
the O
notion O
of O
a O
fifth B-ORDINAL
bracelet O
for O
us O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
the O
only O
way O
that O
they O
would O
have O
let O
us O
in O
there O
was O
to O
take O
her O
mothers O
away O
, O
Right O
. O
which O
we O
would O
n't O
ask O
and O
which O
she O
would O
n't O
do O
. O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
%um O
the O
lawyer O
had O
told O
us O
he O
had O
arranged O
everything O
ahead O
of O
time O

and O
there O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
I O
D O
there O
at O
the O
hospital O
for O
us O

and O
it O
was O
all O
set O

and O
of O
course O
he O
had O
n't O
done O
anything O
. O

I O
see O
. O

He O
had O
n't O
done O
that O
, O
%hm O
. O

No O
. O

He O
had O
n't O
done O
anything O
. O

He O
's O
been O
just O
hopeless O
. O

%hm O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
think O
legally O
he O
's O
not O
hopeless O
. O

I O
think O
he O
's O
done O
all O
the O
necessary O
legal O
things O

but O
%um O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
things O
, O

He O
's O
an O
S O
O O
B O

forgive O
me O
tape O
whoever O
you O
are O

but O
he O
was O
a O
fucker O
. O

yeah O
. O

No O
. O

th- O

And O
%um O
I O
'm O
sorry O

but O
he O
was O
. O

I O
think O
they O
said O
published O
actually O
. O

oh O
well O
they O
can O
edit O
that O
word O
I O
guess O

Anyway O
it O
's O
English B-LANGUAGE

so O

yeah O
. O

It O
's O
American B-NORP
English B-LANGUAGE
. O

%um O

You O
know O
he O
, O
he O
said O
things O
to O
me O
like O
well O
you O
'll O
have O
her O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
your O
life O
, O
you O
know O
. O
yeah O
. O
Do O
n't O
worry O
about O
it O
, O
which O
is O
really O
an O
arrogant O
attitude O
to O
take O
, O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

Man O
. O

yeah O
. O

He O
was O
really O
, O
he O
was O
a O
real O
arrogant O
S O
O O
B O
, O

so O

How O
old O
was O
he O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

we O
never O
met O
him O
. O

He O
never O
showed O
up O
. O

oh O
. O

W- O
, O
he O
ended O
up O

in O
the O
end O
, O
his O
par- O
, O
he O
sent O
his O
partner O
to O
actually O
sign O
the O
papers O
who O
's O
not O
even O
an O
adoption O
attorney O
. O

mhm O
. O

He O
does O
litigation O
. O

Does O
n't O
know O
what O
he O
's O
doing O

but O
I O
hope O
he O
did O
what O
his O
partner O
told O
him O
to O
do O
. O

mhm O
. O

%mm O

mhm O
. O

But O
he O
at O
least O
was O
a O
sensitive O
human O
being O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
%um O
, O
you O
know O
so O
that O
was O
nice O
. O

He O
had O
some O
sensitivity O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
get O
cut O
off O
soon O
. O

oh O
no O

And O
I O
want O
to O
, O

I O
hope O
you O

Tell O
me O
something O
then O
. O

I O
'll O
shut O
up O
. O

You O
can O
tell O
me O
something O
. O

What O
? O

. O

No O
. O

I O
'm O
worrying O
ab- O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
worrying O

I O
'm O
feeling O
like O
oh O

gosh O
should O
all O
of O
this O
be O
in O
the O
public O
record O
or O
something O
. O

oh O

Well O

just O
beeped O

think O
that O
might O
mean O
we O
have O
to O
hang O
up O
. O

okay O
. O

We O
have O
a O
minute O
. O

%um O

I O
want O

it O
thirty B-TIME
minutes I-TIME

it O

It O
's O
going O
to O
be O
thirty B-TIME
minutes I-TIME
in O
about B-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
I O
think O

because O

. O

You O

oh O
so O
that O
sounds O
very O
nice O
. O

They O
were O
loose O
or O
in O
a O

Well O
I O
they O
were O
loose O

they O
were O

I O
said O
the O
Sheila B-PERSON
I O
think O
I O
hear O
a O
parakeet O
. O

uh-huh O

And O
you O
could O
tell O
he O
thought O
that O
it O
was O
nonsense O
that O
it O
was O
a O
uh-huh O
crow O

and O
then O
I O
saw O
it O

but O
the O
sun O
was O
against O
my O
eyes O

oh O
how O
neat O

so O
I O
could O
n't O
tell O

and O
then O
it O
flew O

and O
when O
it O
flew O
three O
more O
of O
them O
flew O
out O
of O
the O
same O
tree O
. O

oh O
how O
neat O
. O

There O
was O
a O
street O
They O
were O
beautiful O
. O
there O
was O
a O
street O
I O
walked O
down O
in O
Barcelona B-GPE
big O
wide O

with O
all O
the O
bird O
sellers O

Yes O
. O

They O
were O
closed O
up O
that O
day O

but O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
what O
these O
were O
is O
Well O
it O
was O
g- O
it O
was O
a O
wonderful O
place O
I O
mean O
I O
guess O
you O
have O
to O
sort O
of O
discount O
that O
they O
're O
in O
cages O
but O
Escapees O

yeah O

yeah O

It O
's O
it O
's O
part O
of O

it O
was O
beautiful O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
was O
just O
so O
beautiful O
with O
all O
these O
amazing O
yeah O
. O
birds O
and O
colors O
. O

And O
also O
in O
parts O
of O
Spain B-GPE
, O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
they O
have O
this O
in O
parts O
of O
France B-GPE
, O

but O
Probably O
not O

I O
saw O
parts O
of O
Spain B-GPE
where O
they O
had O
birds O
on O
the O
shutters O
and O
they O
put O
them O
out O
during O
the O
day O
. O

It O
's O
very O
popular O
in O
Spain B-GPE

but O
it O
's O
not O
so O
popular O
here O
in O
France B-GPE
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
was O
a O
nice O
thing O
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O
I O
've O
seen O
very O
little O
of O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O

y- O

I O
had O
friends O
in O
Madrid B-GPE
whose O
father O
bred O
birds O
actually O
. O

oh O
really O
? O

In O
their O
apartment O
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
's O
quite O
a O
big O
hobby O
. O

Parakeets O
or O
? O

No O
little O
tiny O
birds O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
were O
. O

Little O

Finches O
maybe O
. O

yeah O
. O

Song O
birds O
of O
some O
kind O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

oh O
neat O
. O

And O
he O
was O
good O
at O
breeding O
them O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

so O

oh O
well O
that O
's O
good O

So O

but O
when O
you O
went O
up O
to O
Connecticut B-GPE
, O
all O
was O
well O
? O

Or O
was O
that O
another O
adventure O
? O

up O
to O
Connecticut B-GPE
? O

Did O
I O
go O
to O

Then O
you O
had O
to O
go O
up O
and O
get O
Jack B-PERSON
and O
everything O
after O

oh O
yeah O

it O
's O
it O
's O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
still O

but O
. O

oh O
. O

%um O
yeah O

we O
got O
up O
. O

We O
got O
Jack B-PERSON
. O

We O
went O
to O
the O
lawyer O
our O
lawyer O
who O
's O
been O
mhm O
. O
Absolutely O
fantastic O
start O
to O
finish O
. O

I O
think O
she O
's O
great O
. O

mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O

%um O
and O
then O
came O
home O

and O
that O
's O
when O
yeah O
then O
Robert B-PERSON
's O
mom O
crashed O
the O
car O
. O

oh O
I O
see O

it O
was O
after O
that O
that O
she O
did O
that O
. O

So O
yeah O

actually O
we O
had O
to O
do O
that O
at O
like O
eight O
o'clock O
the O
next O
morning O
because O
Martha B-PERSON
was O
leaving O
by O
nine B-TIME
. O

So O
mom O
and O
dad O
were O
down O
there O
for O
how O
long O
? O

They O
came O
Saturday B-DATE
and O
stayed O
Saturday B-DATE
night O
and O
Sunday B-DATE
and O
left O
Monday B-DATE

uh-huh O
. O

This O
past O
Monday B-DATE
like O


A O
second B-ORDINAL
round O
of O
Israeli B-NORP
- O
Palestinian O
talks O
ended O
Saturday B-TIME
night I-TIME
with O
no O
breakthrough O
but O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
have O
agreed O
to O
keep O
talking O
. O

Led O
by O
former O
Israeli B-NORP
Prime O

Shimone B-PERSON
Peres I-PERSON
and O
Palestinian B-NORP
leader O
Yasser B-PERSON
Arafat I-PERSON
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
delegations O
met O
for O
more B-TIME
than I-TIME
two I-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

They O
are O
trying O
to O
narrow O
their O
differences O
over O
a O
US B-GPE
framework O
for O
negotiating O
a O
final O
peace O
agreement O
. O


Well O
Tony B-PERSON
, O
Israeli B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
Ehud B-PERSON
Barak I-PERSON
says O
he O
will O
not O
sign O
any O
peace O
deal O
that O
gives O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
sovereignty O
over O
Jerusalem B-GPE
's O
revered O
Temple B-LOC
Mount I-LOC
. O

Mr. O
Barak B-PERSON
also O
stressed O
that O
his O
government O
will O
never O
accept O
an O
accord O
that O
gives O
Palestinians B-NORP
the O
right O
to O
return O
to O
Israel B-GPE

THE O

First B-ORDINAL

there O

the O
name O

'' O

Better O
than O
all O
those O
offers O
you O
get O
to O
buy O

backed O
by O
nothing O
. O

And O
there O
's O
more O
. O

The O
assets O
backing O
the O

come O
from O
some O
of O
the O
country O
's O
biggest O
-- O
and O
most O
secure O
-- O
institutions O
. O

Most O
earn O
high O
ratings O
from O
credit O
agencies O
. O

Their O
yields O
are O
higher O
than O
those O
of O
U.S. B-ORG
Treasury I-ORG
issues O
. O

And O
the O
booming O
market O
has O
already O
attracted O
many O
of O
the O
nation O

biggest O
institutional O
investors O
. O

Ready O
to O
jump O
? O

Well O
, O
think O
twice O
. O

The O
concept O
may O
be O
simple O
: O
Take O
a O
bunch O
of O
loans O
, O
tie O
them O
up O
in O
one O
neat O
package O
, O
and O
sell O
pieces O
of O
the O
package O
to O
investors O
. O

But O
the O
simplicity O
may O
be O
misleading O
. O

Skeptics O
say O
the O
slightly O
higher O
returns O
are O
n't O
enough O
to O
compensate O
for O
the O
extra O
risk O
. O

They O
warn O
that O
asset O
- O
backed O
securities O
are O
only O
as O
good O
as O
the O
assets O
and O
credit O
backing O
that O
support O
them O
-- O
and O
those O
are O
hard O
to O
evaluate O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
securities O
were O
introduced O
only B-DATE
about I-DATE
4 I-DATE
1/2 I-DATE

; O
the O

unknown O
is O
how O

skeptics O

that O

a O

That O
kind O
of O
spread O
can O
be O
critical O
for O
money O
managers O
who O
buy O
bonds O
in O
large O
quantities O
and O
whose O
livelihood O
depends O
on O
outperforming O
the O

manager O
across O
the O
street O
. O

But O
for O
individuals O
who O
buy O
much O
smaller O
amounts O
and O
care O
less O
about O
relative O
performance O
than O
in O
preserving O
what O
they O
have O
, O
that O
margin O
is O
meaningless O
. O

`` O
If O
you O
're O
in O

even O
an O
extra O
25 B-CARDINAL

0.25 B-CARDINAL

becomes O
an O
important O
consideration O

'' O
says O
Mr. O

. O

`` O
But O
if O
you O
're O
an O

it O
back O

then O
that O
is O
n't O
of O
overwhelming O
importance O
. O
'' O

Moreover O
, O
the O
interest O
on O
asset O

backed O
securities O
is O
fully O
taxable O
, O
while O
interest O
on O
Treasury B-ORG
issues O
is O
tax O
- O
free O
at O
the O
state O
and O
local O
level O
. O

That O
's O
why O
some O

such O

, O
a O
vice O

of O
Chase B-ORG

Mr. O

with O
tax O

deferred O

such O
as O

He O
points O
out O
that O
institutions O
buying O
asset O

backed O
issues O
in O
large O
quantities O
can O
earn O
higher O
spreads O
over O
Treasurys B-ORG
than O
individuals O
buying O
smaller O
amounts O
. O

Another O
concern O
is O
liquidity O
, O
or O
how O
easily O
a O

can O
be O
converted O
into O
cash O
. O

The O
secondary O
, O

market O
for O

is O
relatively O
new O
and O
much O
less O
active O
than O
for O
Treasury B-ORG

. O

That O
could O
make O
it O
tricky O
for O
investors O
who O
need O
to O
sell O
their O
holdings O
quickly O
before O
the O

mature O

That O
's O
particularly O
true O

analysts O
say O

for O

of O
the O

as O

In O

if O
there O

a O
problem O
, O
do O
n't O
expect O
Citibank B-ORG
to O
come O
to O

. O

The O
prospectus O
also O
notes O
that O
the O
securities O
are O
not O
guaranteed O
by O
any O
government O
agency O
. O

That O
means O
investors O
have O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
debt O
that O
lies O
beneath O
the O
securities O
, O
as O
well O
as O
on O
the O
credit O
enhancement O
for O
the O
issue O
and O
the O
credit O
ratings O
the O
issue O
has O
received O
. O

That O
also O
is O
n't O
easy O
. O

Take O
the O
`` O
credit O
enhancements O
, O
'' O
which O
typically O
include O
a O
bank O
letter O
of O
credit O
or O
insurance O
from O
a O
bond O
- O
insurance O
company O
. O

The O
letter O
of O
credit O
typically O
is O
not O
offered O
by O
the O
bank O
selling O
the O
assets O
to O
back O
the O
securities O
. O

Nor O
does O
it O
cover O
the O
entire O
portfolio O
. O

Details O
of O
credit O
enhancements O
vary O
widely O
from O
issue O
to O
issue O
. O

Still O
, O
they O
play O
a O
crucial O
role O
in O
winning O
top O
ratings O
for O
most O
asset O
- O
backed O
issues O
-- O
which O
in O
turn O
is O
why O
the O
yield O
above O
Treasurys B-ORG
is O
so O
slim O
. O

But O
skeptics O
ask O
why O
you O
should O
bother O
buying O
this O
stuff O
when O
you O
can O
get O
only O
slightly O
lower O
yields O
on O
government O
- O
guaranteed O
paper O
. O

When O
you O
buy O
an O
asset O
- O
backed O
issue O
, O
you O
take O
the O
risk O
that O
a O
bank O
or O
an O
insurer O
could O
run O
into O
unexpected O
difficulties O
. O

If O
a O
bank O
's O
credit O
rating O
was O
lowered O
because O
of O
, O
say O
, O
its O
loans O
to O
Third O
World O
nations O
, O
that O
could O
also O
affect O
the O
ratings O
, O
liquidity O
and O
prices O
of O
the O
asset O
- O
backed O
issues O
that O
the O
bank O
supports O
. O

Underwriters O
insist O
these O
issues O
are O
constructed O
to O
withstand O
extremely O
tough O
economic O
conditions O
. O

But O
despite O
the O
credit O
enhancements O
, O
despite O
the O
high O
ratings O
, O
some O
money O
managers O
still O
worry O
that O
a O
recession O
could O
wreak O
havoc O
on O
the O
underlying O
assets O
. O

At O
a O
time O
when O
Americans B-NORP
are O
leveraged O
to O
their O
eyeballs O
, O
asset O
- O
backed O
investors O
may O
be O
taking O
a O
heady O
gamble O
that O
consumers O
will O
be O
able O
to O
repay O
loans O
in O
hard O
times O
. O

At O
the O
very O
least O
, O
a O
recession O
would O
prompt O
investors O
to O
buy O
the O
highest O
- O
quality O
bonds O
they O
can O
find O
-- O
that O
is O
, O
Treasurys B-ORG
. O

That O
could O
widen O
the O
yield O
spread O
between O
Treasurys B-ORG
and O
asset O
- O
backed O
securities O
, O
as O
well O
as O
make O
it O
tougher O
to O
unload O
the O
latter O
. O

But O
it O
could O
be O
much O
worse O
. O

Some O
analysts O
are O
especially O
wary O
of O
credit O
- O
card O
issues O
. O

For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
credit O
- O
card O
loans O
are O
unsecured O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
they O
fear O
that O
banks O
have O
been O
overeager O
to O
issue O
cards O
to O
the O
public O
-- O
giving O
cards O
to O
too O
many O
big O
spenders O
who O
will O
default O
during O
a O
recession O
. O

First B-ORDINAL

please O
brief O

what O
was O

during O

the O
Russian B-NORP

Was O
the O

? O

Eh O
, O
well O
, O
President O
Putin B-PERSON
and O
Prime O
Minister O
Koizumi B-PERSON
, O
ah O
, O
the O

a O
total O

a I-TIME
half I-TIME
hours I-TIME
and O
signed O
a O
total O

12 B-CARDINAL

It O
should O
be O
said O
that O
quite O
a O
large O
number O
of O
documents O
were O
signed O
. O

However O
, O
the O
general O
reaction O
from O
scholars O
, O
media O
, O
or O
ordinary O
people O
here O
, O
er O
, O
is O
rather O
low O
key O
, O
because O
, O
er O
, O
there O
has O
been O
no O
progress O
on O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
issues O
that O
Japan B-GPE
is O
relatively O
concerned O
with O
, O
the O
Northern B-LOC
Territories I-LOC
issue O
, O
er O
, O
and O
the O
oil O

issue O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Regarding O
the O
Northern B-LOC
Territories I-LOC
issue O
, O
this O
Russian O
, O
er O
, O
President O
Putin B-PERSON
purposely O
avoided O
this O
issue O
, O
that O
is O
, O
he O
did O
not O
really O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
there O
has O
still O
been O
no O
progress O
on O
territorial O

Uh-huh O

So O
the O

route O
issue O
, O
though O
the O
Russian B-NORP
side O
promised O
to O
connect O
it O
with O
Japan B-GPE
, O
there O
was O
no O
talk O
about O
prioritizing O
a O
connection O
with O
Japan B-GPE
. O

The O
media O
here O
is O
concerned O
because O
Russia B-GPE
already O
promised O
to O
prioritize O
connecting O
it O
with O
China B-GPE
, O
er O
, O
%pw O
, O
so O
the O
media O
here O
is O
concerned O
that O
it O
is O
an O
empty O
promise O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
Japan B-GPE
may O
not O
get O
, O
er O
, O
any O
material O
benefit O
, O
while O
the O
Russian B-NORP
side O
will O
have O
gained O
Japan B-GPE
's O
support O
for O
its O
WTO B-ORG
accession O
. O

Er O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
at O
the O
Business B-ORG
Federation I-ORG
meeting O
, O
Russian B-NORP
President O
Putin B-PERSON
urged O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
business O
community O
to O
invest O
in O
Russia B-GPE
. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
or O
little O
progress O
on O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
along O
with O
the O
business O
community O
's O
concerns O
with O
the O
investment O
environment O
in O
Russia B-GPE
, O
well O
, O
it O
remains O
a O
big O
question O
how O
far O
economic O
cooperation O
can O
go O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Host O
. O

This O
was O
the O
main O
content O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
leaders O
' O
talks O
today B-DATE
. O

Well O
, O
what O
kind O
of O
response O
did O
people O
in O
Japan B-GPE
have O
to O
some O
of O
the O
achievements O
Putin O
made O
during O
his O
trip O
to O
Japan O
, O
well O
, O
some O
of O
the O
achievements O
this O
trip O
to O
Japan B-GPE
has O
made O
? O

Er O
, O
it O
is O
still O
rather O
, O
er O
, O
low O
key O
. O

Because O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
ah O
, O
er O
, O
we O
also O
saw O
, O
er O
, O
in O
Tokyo B-GPE
, O
some O
right O
- O
wing O
groups O
held O
demonstrations O
, O
demanding O
that O
Russia B-GPE
return O
, O
return O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

Well O
, O
they O
are O
also O
extremely O
dissatisfied O
because O
no O
progress O
has O
been O
made O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

Well O
, O
both O
the O
media O
and O
citizens O
have O
such O
concerns O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
they O
are O
afraid O
that O
resolution O
of O
territorial O
issues O
may O
take O
rather O
. O

Host O
. O

Okay O
, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
, O
Professor O
Wang B-PERSON
, O
for O
briefing O
us O
on O
the O
relevant O
information O
in O
Japan B-GPE
. O

Thank O
you O
! O

Well O
, O
next O
we O
will O
return O
to O
the O
studio O
to O
interview O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
experts O
in O
the O
studio O
. O

Just O
now O
, O
this O
Professor O
Wang B-PERSON
talked O
about O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
this O
time O
. O

Although O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
signed O
12 B-CARDINAL
agreements O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
Japan B-GPE
is O
not O
very O
satisfied O
with O
the O
content O
of O
the O
agreements O
, O
ah O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
content O
, O
because O
it O
seems O
that O
neither O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
issues O
that O
Japan B-GPE
wanted O
greatly O
to O
talk O
about O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
and O
the O
oil O
pipeline O
issue O
, O
made O
the O
achievements O
they O
had O
anticipated O
. O

Well O
, O
was O
this O
within O
the O
expectations O
of O
you O
two B-CARDINAL
experts O
? O

Right O
, O
this O
is O
rather O
consistent O
with O
unanimous O
international O
public O
opinion O
analysis O
as O
well O
as O
our O
opinion O
these O
days O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
, O
this O
, O
this O
discussion O
, O
it O
was O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
leaders O
of O
both O
sides O
, O
which O
by O
itself O
is O
an O
achievement O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

As O
we O
know O
, O
Putin B-GPE
has O
kept O
putting O
off O
this O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
since O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
like O
back O
then O
when O
Yeltsin B-PERSON
repeatedly O
postponed O
his O
trip O
to O
Japan B-GPE
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
Japan B-GPE
asked O
for O
too O
high O
a O
price O
. O

That O
is O
, O
it O
asked O
the O
Russian B-NORP
president O
to O
come O
to O
Japan B-GPE
to O
make O
concessions O
on O
territorial O
issues O
. O

Well O
, O
%pw O
, O
well O
, O
the O
Russian B-NORP
president O
was O
still O
unwilling O
, O
was O
unwilling O
to O
make O
concessions O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
itinerary O
was O
not O
decided O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Well O
, O
Russia B-GPE
's O
attitude O
was O
that O
it O
would O
not O
talk O
about O
territorial O
issues O
if O
it O
went O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
Japan O
, O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
Japan B-GPE
, O
without O
discussion O
of O
territorial O
issues O
, O
the O
talks O
were O
viewed O
as O
making O
no O
progress O
. O

For O
Japanese B-NORP
citizens O
, O
this O
was O
meaningless O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
only O
provided O
Koizumi B-PERSON
with O
a O
diplomatic O
stage O
. O

What O
method O
does O
he O
want O
to O
use O
to O
remedy O
the O
lethargic O
post-APEC B-ORG
diplomatic O
situation O
? O

Well O
, O
what O
Russia B-GPE
actually O
wants O
is O
economic O
cooperation O
with O
Japan B-GPE
, O

Uh-huh O
. O

including O
the O
development O
of O
oil O
resources O
in O
eastern O
Siberia B-LOC
, O
and O
, O
um O
, O
some O
other O
investment O
and O
trade O
. O

Well O
, O
Japan B-GPE
is O
still O
like O
this O
, O
saying O
first B-ORDINAL
return O
the O
territories O
, O
then O
we O
can O
talk O
about O
economics O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
time O
, O
based O
on O
the O
outcome O
this O
time O
, O
I O
think O
this O
basic O
structure O
remains O
unchanged O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Er O
, O
Director O
Xing B-PERSON
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
this O
time O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
very O
important O
purposes O
of O
President O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
is O
to O
facilitate O
the O
progress O
of O
bilateral O
relations O
through O
economic O
development O
. O

But O
from O
what O
our O
Professor O
Wang B-PERSON
has O
just O
introduced O
, O
do O
you O
think O
Putin B-PERSON
has O
achieved O
his O
aim O
? O

Eh O
, O
he O
should O
be O
said O
to O
have O
achieved O
his O
aim O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

The O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
was O
in O
itself O
one O
of O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
important O
aims O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
with O
large O
preconditions O
having O
been O
set O
, O
and O
now O
the O
framework O
having O
being O
set O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
for O
Putin B-PERSON
to O
have O
further O
substantive O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
to O
make O
major O
breakthroughs O
on O
the O
substantive O
issues O
of O
Russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
Japanese I-NORP
relations O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
as O
two B-CARDINAL
neighboring O
nations O
, O
ah O
, O
relations O
between O
them O
should O
be O
developed O
, O
development O
of O
relations O
should O
be O
further O
promoted O
. O

There O
should O
be O
exchanges O
back O
and O
forth O
, O
which O
would O
not O
work O
if O
Putin B-PERSON
refuses O
to O
go O
, O
refuses O
to O
come O
. O

So O
, O
well O
, O
how O
did O
he O
come O
, O
how O
did O
he O
come O
to O
Japan B-GPE
? O

As O
mentioned O
earlier O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
had O
been O
postponed O
again O
and O
again O
, O
but O
by O
way O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
opportunity O
, O
well O
, O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
was O
smoothly O
accomplished O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

As O
to O
what O
kind O
of O
result O
you O
want O
, O
that O
is O
another O
matter O
. O

Right O
. O

But O
making O
the O
trip O
was O
significant O
in O
itself O
. O

What O
was O
the O
significance O
? O

It O
was O
that O
Russia B-GPE
sent O
a O
very O
important O
message O
, O
that O
is O
, O
Russia B-GPE
is O
willing O
to O
develop O
relations O
with O
Japan B-GPE
. O

We O
sincerely O
have O
such O
a O
wish O
. O

A O
wish O
is O
the O
start O
of O
achieving O
results O
. O

We O
have O
such O
a O
start O
. O

Both O
leaders O
saved O
a O
bit O
of O
face O
. O

Right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
giving O
face O
to O
each O
other O
. O
Also O
, O
on O
the O
surface O
we O
saw O
it O
looked O
fine O
, O
with O
12 O
, O
12 B-CARDINAL
documents O
signed O
as O
just O
mentioned O
. O

They O
both O
gave O
face O
. O

Right O
. O

It O
is O
another O
matter O
if O
you O
care O
about O
the O
size O
of O
the O
documents O
. O

But O
they O
were O
signed O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
can O
we O
interpret O
it O
this O
way O
? O

Based O
on O
the O
briefing O
given O
by O
you O
two B-CARDINAL
experts O
, O
both O
Japanese B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
Junichiro B-PERSON
Koizumi I-PERSON
and O
Russian B-NORP
President O
Putin B-PERSON
, O
they O
both O
achieved O
their O
own O
aims O
in O
form O
and O
got O
or O
, O
er O
, O
obtained O
what O
they O
wanted O
through O
this O
visit O
. O

On O
this O
point O
, O
their O
two B-CARDINAL
fates O
are O
connected O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
both O
sides O
have O
strong O
nationalist O
sentiments O
domestically O
and O
powerful O
parliaments O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
at O
this O
point O
it O
would O
be O
ludicrous O
for O
Putin B-PERSON
to O
concede O
on O
the O
territorial O
issues O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
as O
you O
should O
know O
, O
it O
is O
entirely O
impossible O
, O
impossible O
behavior O
. O

Right O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
seems O
it O
may O
also O
be O
very O
difficult O
for O
Koizumi B-PERSON
now O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
on O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
to O
return O
to O
what O
is O
called O
, O
er O
, O
economics O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
territories O
second B-ORDINAL
, O
or O
the O
separation O
of O
politics O
and O
economics O
, O
the O
separation O
of O
politics O
and O
economics O
, O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
then O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
later O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
recently O
Taro O
Aso O
again O
proposed O
, O
that O
is O
, O
new O
Prime O
%pw O
, O
new O
Foreign O
Minister O
Aso B-PERSON
proposed O
a O
theory O
of O
joint O
development O
, O
that O
is O
, O
to O
postpone O
-LSB- O
-LSB- O
the O
issue O
of O
sovereignty O
of O
the O
northern O
-RSB- O
-RSB- O
and O
to O
jointly O
develop O
the O
four O
, O
four O
islands O
, O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
. O

Well O
, O
in O
fact O
the O
theory O
of O
joint O
development O
was O
originally O
proposed O
by O
Russia B-GPE
. O

Well O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
in O
1996 B-DATE
, O
Primakov B-PERSON
also O
proposed O
it O
when O
he O
was O
foreign O
minister O
. O

It O
had O
been O
raised O
prior O
to O
that O
too O
, O
but O
Japan B-GPE
did O
not O
accept O
it O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Well O
, O
why O
did O
Taro B-PERSON
Aso I-PERSON
recently O
again O
propose O
such O
a O
, O
er O
, O
such O
a O
suggestion O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
checked O
some O
data O
, O
ah O
. O

Japan B-GPE
's O
recent O
reaction O
is O
not O
Japan B-GPE
's O
mainstream O
domestic O
opinion O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
domestic O
political O
circles O
in O
Japan B-GPE
all O
opposed O
this O
suggestion O
by O
Taro B-PERSON
Aso I-PERSON
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

They O
said O
that O
with O
joint O
development O
, O
Russia B-GPE
would O
advocate O
adopting O
the O
current O
Russian B-NORP
controlled O
situation O
, O
the O
current O
situation O
, O
and O
applying O
Russian B-NORP
law O
. O

Well O
, O
by O
making O
investments O
there O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
well O
, O
it O
would O
be O
equivalent O
to O
permanent O
recognition O
that O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
are O
Russia B-GPE
's O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
this O
theory O
of O
joint O
development O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
make O
progress O
either O
. O

So O
under O
the O
current O
situation O
, O
the O
meeting O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
leaders O
itself O
was O
the O
greatest O
achievement O
this O
time O
. O

The O
rest O
did O
not O
have O
any O
substantive O
significance O
. O

Right O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
add O
a O
few O
words O
. O

Regarding O
the O
joint O
development O
he O
talked O
about O
, O
Russia B-GPE
is O
also O
very O
interesting B-GPE
. O

Now O
Russia O
, O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
proposed O
it O
, O
now O
Russia B-GPE
instead O
rejected O
it O
. O

It O
rejected O
it O
, O
its O
government O
stated O
very O
clearly O
, O
we O
can O
not O
jointly O
develop O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
interesting O
issue O
. O

Right O
. O

They O
dropped O
it O
. O

Right O
. O

What O
do O
you O
say O
about O
this O
? O

Er O
, O
it O
, O
Russia O
, O
it O
also O
has O
, O
it O
also O
has O
, O
also O
has O
its O
vigilance O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
also O
has O
a O
lot O
to O
do O
with O
Russia B-GPE
's O
strategy O
of O
building O
a O
powerful O
nation O
. O

Russia B-GPE
now O
, O
it O
has O
independently O
formulated O
a O
strategic O
vision O
of O
developing O
the O
Far B-LOC
East I-LOC
and O
Siberian B-NORP
regions O
. O

It O
has O
such O
a O
vision O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

The O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
are O
included O
in O
this O
grand O
vision O
. O

Right O
. O

Today B-DATE
, O
among O
our O
topics O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
can O
be O
said O
to O
be O
the O
core O
topic O
. O

We O
can O
discuss O
this O
issue O
again O
in O
detail O
at O
the O
end O
. O

Well O
, O
before O
this O
, O
we O
have O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
question O
, O
that O
is O
, O
er O
, O
regarding O
the O
issue O
of O
this O
Russian B-NORP
President O
Putin B-GPE

Let O
's O
gain O
some O
understanding O
through O
this O

Why O
did O
Russian B-NORP
President O

visit O

again O
after O
five O
years O
, O
an O
interval O
of O
five B-DATE

after O
quite O

It O
can O

said O
that O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
after O
an O

could O
personally O
intervene O
in O
the O
territorial O
issues O
existing O
between O
Japan B-GPE
and O
Russia B-GPE
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

However O
, O
by O
May B-DATE
, O
the O
Russian B-NORP
side O
said O
it O
could O
not O
provide O
measures O
for O
resolving O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
and O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
was O
pushed O
to O
the B-DATE
spring I-DATE
of I-DATE
2005 I-DATE
. O

While O
Japan B-GPE
expressed O
helplessness O
to O
this O
, O
it O
hoped O
Putin B-PERSON
could O
visit O
in O
February B-DATE
as O
it O
was O
the O
150th B-ORDINAL
anniversary O
of O
the O
signing O
of O
a O
trade O
and O
border O
treaty O
between O
Japan B-GPE
and O
Russia B-GPE
. O

However O
, O
Putin B-PERSON
responded O
only O
with O
a O
congratulatory O
telegram O
, O
with O
no O
mention O
of O
his O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
. O

On O
September B-DATE
2 I-DATE
, I-DATE
2004 I-DATE
, O
Koizumi B-PERSON
went O
by O
boat O
to O
tour O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

This O
move O
at O
once O
infuriated O
Russia B-GPE
. O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
date O
of O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
turned O
into O
a O
variable O
which O
nobody O
could O
explain O
. O

In O
various O
versions O
, O
some O
said O
Putin B-PERSON
would O
visit O
Japan B-GPE
in O
April B-DATE
2005 I-DATE
, O
some O
said O
May B-DATE
, O
while O
others O
said O
June B-DATE
. O

In O
Russia B-GPE
's O
diplomatic O
circles O
, O
there O
were O
even O
widespread O
rumors O
, O
including O
that O
Putin B-PERSON
would O
not O
visit O
Japan B-GPE
within O
the B-DATE
year I-DATE
and O
that O
Russia B-GPE
's O
ambassador O
to O
Japan B-GPE
would O
soon O
be O
removed O
. O

Various O
speculation O
existed O
until O
May B-DATE
2005 I-DATE
, O
at O
the O
celebration O
of O
the O
60th B-ORDINAL
anniversary O
of O
victory O
in O
the O
world O
's O
anti-fascist O
war O
. O

Under O
pressure O
from O
various O
sides O
, O
Koizumi B-PERSON
reluctantly O
attended O
this O
celebration O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
precisely O
because O
of O
this O
, O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
was O
basically O
confirmed O
. O

This O
time O
, O
on O
this O
visit O
between O
Japan O
and O
the O
US O
, O
er O
, O
between O
Russia B-GPE
and O
Japan B-GPE
, O
ah O
, O
er O
, O
as O
far O
as O
Japan B-GPE
was O
concerned O
, O
it O
really O
hoped O
that O
Russian B-NORP
President O
Putin B-PERSON
would O
talk O
about O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
during O
his O
visit O
. O

However O
, O
Russia B-GPE
's O
thinking O
was O
, O
er O
, O
we O
want O
to O
develop O
the O
economy O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

There O
should O
be O
economic O
cooperation O
before O
we O
can O
talk O
about O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
, O
which O
means O
that O
currently O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
both O
insist O
on O
a O
condition O
from O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Well O
, O
in O
this O
way O
, O
the O
conflict O
would O
become O
more O
conspicuous O
during O
the O
talks O
. O

Well O
, O
was O
this O
also O
the O
reason O
that O
caused O
Russian B-NORP
President O
Putin B-PERSON
, O
in O
spite O
of O
" O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
being O
close O
neighbors O
" O
these B-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
to O
visit O
Japan B-GPE
again O
only O
after O
these O
five O
years O
, O
an O
interval O
of O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
? O

This O
is O
already O
, O
this O
is O
not O
just O
during O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
tenure O
, O
that O
is O
, O
it O
has O
been O
like O
this O
for O
the B-DATE
60 I-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
the O
war O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
whether O
there O
should O
be O
a O
separation O
of O
politics O
and O
economics O
or O
not O
. O

That O
is O
, O
whether O
it O
should O
be O
economic O
cooperation O
first B-ORDINAL
or O
resolution O
of O
political O
issues O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
eased O
for O
a O
period O
after O
the B-EVENT
Cold I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
during O
the O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
era O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
recognized O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
issue O
between O
Japan B-GPE
and O
Russia B-GPE
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
like O
this O
in O
the O
past O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
only O
the O
issue O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
was O
recognized O
. O

Well O
, O
there O
was O
once O
an O
opportunity O
for O
this O
, O
but O
Japan B-GPE
again O
did O
not O
seize O
it O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Russia B-GPE
has O
changed O
a O
lot O
as O
well O
. O

Well O
, O
later O
, O
that O
is O
, O
after O
several O
changes O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
during O
Hashimoto B-PERSON
Ryutaro I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
term O
, O
ah O
, O
Russia B-PERSON
proposed O
separating O
politics O
from O
economics O
, O
to O
make O
progress O
on O
both O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

However O
, O
when O
it O
came O
to O
the O
critical O
moment O
, O
that O
is O
, O
on O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
perhaps O
due O
to O
Japan B-GPE
's O
domestic O
nationalist O
sentiments O
and O
the O
sensitivity O
of O
the O
territorial O
issues O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
any O
prime O
minister O
to O
claim O
for O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
only O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

When O
talks O
on O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
came O
to O
a O
final O
decision O
, O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
prime O
minister O
retreated O
again O
to O
the O
point O
that O
politics O
and O
economics O
could O
not O
be O
separated O
and O
that O
political O
issues O
should O
still O
be O
resolved O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
in O
addition O
, O
the O
Russian B-NORP
president O
was O
exactly O
the O
opposite O
, O
that O
is O
, O
denying O
at O
critical O
moments O
that O
there O
were O
territorial O
issues O
, O
that O
is O
, O
sometimes O
even O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
give O
the O
territories O
to O
Japan B-GPE
. O

So O
, O
this O
shows O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
resolve O
Japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
Russian I-NORP
relations O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

I O
think O
in O
the O
near O
future O
, O
er O
, O
the O
possibility O
of O
breakthrough O
progress O
is O
also O
very O
little O
, O
very O
small O
. O

Eh O
, O
we O
all O
know O
Japan B-GPE
is O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
largest O
economy O
in O
the O
world O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
Japan B-GPE
is O
also O
a O
very O
important O
investor O
overseas O
. O

However O
, O
a O
set O
of O
data O
shows O
that O
Japanese B-NORP
investment O
in O
Russia B-GPE
accounts O
for O
only O
1 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
its O
investments O
overseas O
, O
that O
is O
, O
just O
over O
700 B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
US I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

Well O
, O
as O
Russia B-GPE
should O
be O
said O
to O
badly O
need O
Japanese B-NORP
funds O
, O
as O
well O
as O
badly O
needing O
Japanese B-NORP
economic O
cooperation O
, O
well O
, O
how O
urgent O
do O
you O
think O
Russia B-GPE
's O
need O
is O
? O

I O
think O
the O
time O
of O
Russia B-GPE
's O
most O
urgent O
need O
is O
already O
over O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

The O
most O
urgent O
time O
was O
still O
the B-DATE
1990s I-DATE
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
Russia B-GPE
was O
indeed O
pressing O
for O
Japanese B-NORP
investment O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
Russia B-GPE
was O
in O
a O
high O
degree O
, O
or O
deep O
degree O
of O
overall O
crisis O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
was O
like O
a O
very O
thirsty O
man O
who O
needs O
to O
drink O
water O
. O

At O
such O
time O
, O
he O
needs O
, O
needs O
someone O
else O
to O
give O
him O
a O
cup O
of O
water O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
now O
, O
the O
economic O
crisis O
in O
Russia B-GPE
is O
essentially O
over O
. O

Well O
, O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
Russia B-GPE
, O
er O
, O
it O
can O
make O
diplomatic O
arrangements O
calmly O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
think O
Japan B-GPE
, O
that O
is O
, O
again O
lost O
the O
best O
opportunity O
to O
enter O
the O
%pw O
Russian B-NORP
market O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
can O
not O
be O
said O
to O
have O
lost O
it O
forever O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
that O
time O
was O
the O
best O
, O
a O
relatively O
good O
period O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Why O
should O
we O
say O
that O
? O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
at O
that O
time O
if O
Japan B-GPE
had O
made O
a O
very O
good O
investment O
in O
Russia B-GPE
, O
well O
, O
Japan B-GPE
, O
in O
terms O
of O
Russia B-GPE
's O
economy O
, O
it O
could O
have O
helped O
Russia B-GPE
's O
economic O
recovery O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
currently O
Japan B-GPE
is O
very O
important O
to O
Russia B-GPE
again O
. O

Well O
, O
as O
a O
neighboring O
nation O
, O
especially O
as O
Japan B-GPE
is O
a O
world O
economic O
power O
, O
Russia B-GPE
really O
needs O
Japanese B-NORP
investment O
, O
now O
not O
Japanese B-NORP
aid O
, O
but O
its O
investment O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
can O
also O
be O
said O
it O
is O
this O
way O
strategically O
. O

Putin B-PERSON
's O
current O
strategy O
is O
to O
build O
a O
powerful O
nation O
, O
a O
strategy O
for O
making O
his O
country O
powerful O
and O
his O
people O
rich O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
strategy O
is O
extremely O
clear O
. O

He O
used O
an O
expression O
, O
saying O
that O
Russia B-GPE
's O
diplomacy O
is O
economic O
diplomacy O
. O

All O
economic O
%pw O
, O
diplomatic O
activities O
must O
promote O
Russia B-GPE
's O
prosperity O
, O
eh O
, O
development O
, O
and O
wealth O
and O
power O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
seen O
from O
this O
perspective O
, O
well O
, O
%pw O
Japan B-GPE
is O
very O
important O
to O
Russia B-GPE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Therefore O
, O
just O
now O
you O
mentioned O
some O
figures O
regarding O
Russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
Japanese I-NORP
relations O
, O
that O
is O
, O
economic O
and O
trade O
relations O
, O
for O
such O
a O
large O
, O
such O
a O
powerful O
economy O
as O
Japan B-GPE
, O
well O
, O
it O
invested O
only O
700-plus B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
in O
Russia B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
extremely O
small O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Said O
it O
will O
be O
ten B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
. O

Well O
, O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
's I-DATE
trade O
volume O
was O
perhaps O
more B-MONEY
than I-MONEY
9 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
. O

This O
year O
, O
%pw O
, O
Koizumi B-PERSON
said O
it O
may O
exceed O
100 B-MONEY
trillion I-MONEY
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
small O
figure O
in O
terms O
of O
trade O
relations O
between O
two B-CARDINAL
countries O
. O

It O
has O
nearly O
reached O
200 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
between O
China B-GPE
and O
Japan B-GPE
. O

So O
. O

Right O
. O

Here O
it O
has O
a O
comparison O
. O

er O
, O
between O
Russia B-GPE
and O
Japan B-GPE
, O
the O
trade O
volume O
only O
equals O
, O
of O
Sino B-NORP
- I-NORP
Japanese I-NORP
trade O
volume O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
twenty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
second I-CARDINAL
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Right O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
twenty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
second I-CARDINAL
, O
or O
one B-CARDINAL
nineteenth I-CARDINAL
. O

Well O
, O
what O
does O
this O
status O
show O
? O

Right O
, O
just O
about O
, O
eh O
. O

It O
shows O
-- O
I O
will O
explain O
two B-CARDINAL
issues O
-- O
one B-CARDINAL
, O
it O
may O
show O
that O
the O
economic O
environment O
in O
Russia B-GPE
is O
indeed O
not O
very O
good O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
general O
, O
none O
of O
the O
various O
countries O
, O
eh O
, O
large O
nations O
in O
the O
world O
, O
have O
entered O
the O
Russian B-NORP
market O
with O
much O
ease O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

This O
is O
an O
objective O
factor O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
subjective O
factor O
too O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
it O
is O
not O
that O
Japan B-GPE
does O
not O
need O
the O
Russian B-NORP
market O
. O

Perhaps O
some O
non-economic O
factor O
is O
playing O
a O
role O
. O

It O
has O
always O
been O
the O
territorial O
issue O
. O

Well O
, O
as O
we O
said O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
nationalist O
sentiment O
plays O
a O
great O
role O
here O
. O

So O
one O
very O
important O
aim O
of O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
this O
time O
, O
which O
I O
also O
think O
is O
very O
clever O
, O
is O
to O
put O
aside O
some O
very O
sensitive O
old O
territorial O
topics O
. O

This O
topic O
is O
hard O
to O
tackle O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

However O
, O
he O
can O
promote O
the O
development O
of O
economic O
relations O
, O
as O
economics O
is O
a O
dynamic O
factor O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Putin B-PERSON
came O
this O
time O
bringing O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
100 I-CARDINAL
people O
, O
such O
a O
large O
delegation O
, O
to O
Japan B-GPE
. O

He O
still O
intends O
to O
solicit O
businesses O
and O
investment O
, O
to O
use O
our O
Chinese B-NORP
expression O
, O
yet O
this O
intention O
is O
very O
obvious O
. O

Right O
, O
right O
. O

Right O
, O
I O
think O
. O

However O
, O
based O
on O
this O
outcome O
, O
the O
form O
still O
seems O
to O
have O
outdone O
the O
content O
. O

I O
think O
that O
with O
regard O
to O
Japan B-GPE
's O
relations O
with O
Russia B-GPE
, O
it O
has O
been O
like O
this O
since O
the B-DATE
1970s I-DATE
. O

When O
Tanaka B-PERSON
Kakuei I-PERSON
went O
there O
, O
he O
also O
did O
this O
. O

I O
will O
invest O
, O
I O
will O
give O
you O
aid O
to O
develop O
eastern O
Siberia B-LOC
. O

That O
's O
because O
Russia B-GPE
has O
a O
vast O
area O
of O
land O
. O

We O
know O
the O
population O
is O
small O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
they O
can O
not O
develop O
it O
. O

That O
is O
, O
the O
treasure O
is O
all O
hidden O
underground O
. O

Well O
, O
at O
that O
time O
it O
, O
it O
still O
, O
they O
still O
wanted O
to O
solve O
the O
population O
problem O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
this O
, O
that O
is O
, O
Japan B-GPE
used O
economics O
for O
political O
purposes O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
now O
it O
seems O
that O
Koizumi B-PERSON
has O
still O
not O
changed O
this O
course O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
way O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
dead O
knot O
can O
be O
untied O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
things O
continue O
like O
this O
, O
increasing O
the O
nations O
' O
mutual O
trust O
can O
never O
be O
realized O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
, O
eh O
, O
just O
now O
Director O
Xing B-PERSON
mentioned O
a O
very O
important O
issue O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
nationalist O
sentiment O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
regarding O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
this O
time O
, O
the O
media O
earlier O
predicted O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
that O
when O
the O
time O
came O
, O
there O
would O
be O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
%pw I-CARDINAL
60 I-CARDINAL
groups O
totaling O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
700 I-CARDINAL
people O
, O
along O
with O
more O
than O
200 O
propaganda O
trucks O
, O
hey O
, O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
200 I-CARDINAL
propaganda O
trucks O
on O
the O
streets O
of O
downtown O
Tokyo B-GPE
, O
to O
protest O
against O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
. O

Well O
, O
what O
forces O
do O
these O
people O
and O
groups O
holding O
street O
protests O
represent O
? O

What O
are O
they O
asking O
for O
? O

And O
what O
impact O
will O
it O
have O
on O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
? O

Okay O
. O

They O
are O
some O
focused O
right O
- O
wing O
groups O
, O
similar O
to O
a O
gang O
society O
. O

But O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
this O
Russian B-NORP
issue O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
can O
not O
be O
simply O
regarded O
as O
a O
handful O
of O
people O
making O
trouble O
, O
because O
there O
are O
widespread O
historical O
grievances O
among O
ordinary O
people O
in O
Japan B-GPE
against O
Russia B-GPE
. O

I O
have O
had O
contact O
with O
many O
Japanese B-NORP
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
this O
involves O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
Northern B-LOC
Territories I-LOC
issue O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
it O
originated O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
and O
involves O
three B-CARDINAL
major O
issues O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
is O
that O
historically O
and O
legally O
, O
it O
has O
changed O
several O
times O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
1855 B-DATE
, O
in O
1875 B-DATE
, O
and O
in O
1905 B-DATE
after O
the B-EVENT
Russo I-EVENT
- I-EVENT
Japanese I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
, O
and O
also O
WW B-EVENT
II I-EVENT
, O
at O
these O
critical O
points O
, O
ownership O
of O
the O
territories O
was O
constantly O
changing O
. O

With O
ancestors O
constantly O
changing O
, O
both O
sides O
had O
their O
own O
arguments O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
ownership O
of O
the B-LOC
Northern I-LOC
Territories I-LOC
has O
changed O
several O
times O
, O
and O
there O
has O
been O
no O
single O
law O
. O

Therefore O
, O
there O
is O
truth O
on O
both O
sides O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Now O
Russia B-GPE
says O
this O
was O
the O
result O
of O
WWII B-EVENT
international O
laws O
and O
treaties O
, O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
also O
recognizing O
it O
at O
that O
time O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

The O
entire O
international O
community O
recognizes O
that O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
should O
belong O
to O
Russia B-GPE
. O

Both O
the B-LAW
Yalta I-LAW
Agreement I-LAW
and O
Article B-LAW
2 I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
San I-LAW
Francisco I-LAW
Treaty I-LAW
recognize O
Japan B-GPE
's O
relinquishment O
of O
the B-LOC
Kuril I-LOC
Islands I-LOC
. O

However O
, O
then O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
nationalist O
sentiment O
, O
that O
is O
, O
Japan B-GPE
believes O
that O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
unilaterally O
broke O
the B-LAW
Pact I-LAW
of I-LAW
Neutrality I-LAW
, O
sending O
troops O
into O
Northeast B-LOC
China I-LOC
and O
defeating O
the B-ORG
Kwantung I-ORG
Army I-ORG
. O

For O
things O
like O
this O
, O
as O
Japan B-GPE
looks O
at O
this O
piece O
of O
history O
-- O
also O
, O
Japanese B-NORP
captives O
were O
dragged O
to O
Siberia B-LOC
to O
labor O
camps O
-- O
I O
heard O
there O
were O
100,000 B-CARDINAL
, O
200,000 B-CARDINAL
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
there O
is O
also O
a O
nationalist O
sentiment O
issue O
; O
also O
, O
including O
this O
, O
these O
have O
all O
been O
brought O
together O
. O

Therefore O
, O
unraveling O
this O
historical O
feud O
, O
the O
Northern B-LOC
Territories I-LOC
issue O
, O
is O
not O
so O
clear O
- O
cut O
, O
since O
history O
, O
society O
, O
and O
law O
, O
as O
well O
as O
nationalist O
sentiments O
are O
all O
entangled O
together O
. O

Yeah O
. O

Just O
now O
you O
mentioned O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

Well O
, O
today B-DATE
we O
have O
been O
talking O
about O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
. O

Well O
, O
how O
exactly O
did O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
originate O
? O

Let O
's O
learn O
something O
about O
it O
. O

The O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
, O
Iturup B-LOC
, O
Shikotan B-LOC
, O
the B-LOC
Khabomai I-LOC
Rocks I-LOC
, O
and O
Kunashir B-LOC
, O
are O
located O
in O
the O
northern O
part O
of O
the O
western O
Pacific B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
, O
with O
a O
total O
area O
of O
about B-QUANTITY
5,000 I-QUANTITY
square I-QUANTITY
kilometers I-QUANTITY
, O
which O
Japan B-GPE
calls O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
, O
and O
Russia B-GPE
calls O
Southern B-LOC
Chishima I-LOC
. O

Their O
surrounding O
sea O
waters O
have O
a O
great O
wealth O
of O
fishing O
resources O
and O
undersea O
mineral O
deposits O
, O
with O
highly O
important O
strategic O
positions O
. O

The O
ownership O
of O
these O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
has O
long O
been O
a O
dead O
knot O
in O
Russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
Japanese I-NORP
relations O
that O
has O
been O
difficult O
to O
untie O
. O

In O
August B-DATE
1945 I-DATE
, O
the O
US B-GPE
dropped O
atomic O
bombs O
on O
Hiroshima B-GPE
and O
Nagasaki B-GPE
in O
succession O
. O

To O
ask O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
to O
declare O
war O
against O
Japan B-GPE
, O
the O
US B-GPE
and O
Britain B-GPE
gave O
Russia B-GPE
the O
Chishima B-LOC
Islands I-LOC
and O
the O
southern O
part O
of O
Sakhalin B-LOC
Island I-LOC
, O
which O
Japan B-GPE
occupied O
at O
the O
time O
. O

In O
1955 B-DATE
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
and O
Japan B-GPE
began O
negotiations O
regarding O
the O
normalization O
of O
relations O
. O

The O
then O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
indicated O
willingness O
to O
return O
the B-LOC
Khabomai I-LOC
Rocks I-LOC
and O
Shikotan B-LOC
. O

Yet O
Japan B-GPE
requested O
that O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
return O
Iturup B-LOC
and O
Kunashiri B-LOC
as O
well O
. O

It O
also O
requested O
that O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
promise O
to O
attend O
the O
international O
peace O
conference O
to O
determine O
the O
ownership O
of O
Sakhalin B-LOC
and O
the O
entire O
Chishima B-LOC
Islands I-LOC
. O

Negotiations O
broke O
down O
as O
a O
result O
. O

In O
1956 B-DATE
, O
the O
then O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
restated O
its O
willingness O
to O
return O
the B-LOC
Khabomai I-LOC
Rocks I-LOC
and O
Shikotan B-LOC
. O

Japan B-GPE
again O
said O
that O
unless O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
islands O
were O
returned O
together O
, O
the O
Soviet B-NORP
proposal O
could O
definitely O
not O
be O
accepted O
. O

For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
Japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
Russian I-NORP
relations O
have O
not O
made O
breakthrough O
progress O
due O
to O
the O
deadlocked O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
. O

Today B-DATE
, O
already O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
50 I-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
the O
end O
of O
WW B-EVENT
II I-EVENT
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
nations O
have O
still O
not O
signed O
a O
peace O
treaty O
realizing O
the O
complete O
normalization O
of O
bilateral O
relations O
. O

In O
the O
literal O
sense O
, O
if O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
nations O
have O
not O
signed O
a O
peace O
treaty O
, O
it O
means O
at O
this O
point O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
nations O
are O
still O
at O
war O
. O

As O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
experts O
are O
constantly O
discussing O
, O
saying O
that O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
is O
a O
dead O
knot O
in O
Japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
Russian I-NORP
relations O
, O
yet O
this O
dead O
knot O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
currently O
both O
sides O
have O
this O
idea O
, O
they O
want O
to O
untie O
this O
dead O
knot O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
noticed O
, O
er O
, O
just O
now O
this O
short O
clip O
also O
talked O
about O
it O
, O
at O
that O
time O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
agreed O
to O
return O
two B-CARDINAL
islands O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
but O
, O
but O
, O
eh O
, O
Japan B-GPE
never O
agreed O
. O

But O
now O
, O
we O
also O
notice O
that O
the O
Japanese O
side O
again O
proposed O
, O
Taro B-PERSON
Aso I-PERSON
proposed O
a O
new O
idea O
, O
the O
joint O
development O
that O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
had O
previously O
talked O
about O
. O

Well O
, O
can O
this O
point O
lead O
to O
a O
breakthrough O
in O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
nations O
' O
resolution O
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
? O

I O
think O
it O
is O
very O
hard O
, O
as O
joint O
development O
and O
sovereignty O
of O
the O
islands O
are O
, O
ah O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
concepts O
. O

It O
wo O
n't O
work O
, O
either O
, O
eh O
, O
eh O
. O

But O
this O
is O
relevant O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Oh O
, O
as O
I O
just O
mentioned O
, O
it O
was O
against O
a O
large O
background O
that O
Russia B-GPE
first B-ORDINAL
proposed O
it O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

With O
quite O
a O
troubled O
economy O
, O
quite O
a O
troubled O
economy O
, O
Russia B-GPE
needed O
Japanese B-NORP
investment O
, O
needed O
Japan B-GPE
to O
get O
involved O
through O
this O
channel O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
now O
that O
its O
economy O
has O
greatly O
improved O
, O
Russia B-GPE
does O
not O
need O
to O
take O
this O
diplomatic O
risk O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

This O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
Russia B-GPE
should O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
rather O
strong O
nation O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
place O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
, O
is O
a O
very O
sensitive O
region O
for O
the O
Russian B-NORP
psyche O
. O

Any O
small O
, O
small O
diplomatic O
or O
economic O
action O
will O
affect O
the O
psyche O
of O
Russian B-NORP
citizens O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
, O
well O
, O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
this O
time O
, O
or O
during O
his O
visit O
to O
Japan B-GPE
, O
or O
prior O
to O
this O
, O
there O
were O
rallies O
in O
the O
Far B-LOC
East I-LOC
region O
, O
including O
the O
Sakhalin B-LOC
area O
, O
meant O
to O
give O
many O
warnings O
to O
Putin B-PERSON
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
Russian B-NORP
politicians O
also O
made O
many O
appeals O
regarding O
this O
. O

Well O
, O
one O
Russian B-NORP
politician O
stated O
very O
clearly O
that O
while O
Russia B-GPE
's O
territory O
is O
vast O
, O
Russia B-GPE
does O
not O
have O
territories O
to O
spare O
. O

This O
is O
a O
very O
, O
very O
, O
eh O
, O
tough O
kind O
of O
issue O
. O

Well O
, O
as O
I O
just O
said O
very O
clearly O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
legal O
and O
historical O
complications O
, O
the O
repeated O
change O
of O
ownership O
, O
and O
then O
national O
sentiments O
as O
well O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
are O
also O
strategically O
very O
important O
. O

That O
is O
, O
does O
n't O
Russia B-GPE
advocate O
a O
double O
- O
headed O
eagle O
policy O
? O

Right O
, O
right O
. O

It O
is O
both O
a O
European B-NORP
and O
Asian B-NORP
nation O
. O

Well O
, O
if O
he O
wants O
development O
in O
Asia B-LOC
, O
wo O
n't O
he O
close O
the O
door O
if O
he O
loses O
hold O
of O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
now O
? O

Uh-huh O
. O

Fisheries O
. O

The O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
not O
only O
have O
mineral O
deposits O
, O
oil O
, O
and O
fisheries O
, O
but O
also O
for O
military O
strategy O
, O
they O
are O
key O
positions O
in O
the B-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
. O

In O
the B-LOC
Pacific I-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
, O
right O
. O

Currently O
Russia B-GPE
seems O
to O
be O
in O
a O
period O
of O
low O
tide O
, O
but O
it O
wo O
n't O
stay O
this O
way O
forever O
. O

Right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
. O

It O
is O
still O
a O
large O
nation O
. O

It O
is O
still O
a O
large O
nation O
. O

It O
is O
also O
an O
international O
power O
. O

Therefore O
, O
none O
of O
its O
leaders O
can O
easily O
give O
away O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

It O
, O
if O
it O
, O
let O
me O
again O
add O
some O
words O
, O
if O
it O
wants O
joint O
development O
, O
Japanese B-NORP
companies O
and O
Japanese B-NORP
influence O
will O
enter O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

Right O
, O
right O
. O

Well O
, O
after O
entering O
, O
economy O
, O
economic O
influence O
may O
lead O
to O
political O
influence O
. O

Currently O
that O
would O
seem O
to O
benefit O
Japan O
. O

Yes O
. O

It O
would O
benefit O
Japan B-GPE
. O

Russia B-GPE
has O
foreseen O
the O
consequences O
. O

That O
's O
why O
Russia B-GPE
now O
rejects O
it O
. O

It O
was O
originally O
proposed O
by O
Russia B-GPE
, O
but O
rejected O
by O
Japan B-GPE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

This O
is O
a O
new O
incarnation O
, O
but O
with O
different O
political O
significance O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
since O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
issue O
is O
a O
dead O
knot O
in O
bilateral O
relations O
that O
can O
not O
be O
untied O
, O
and O
also O
both O
are O
working O
hard O
, O
yet O
with O
seemingly O
little O
hope O
in O
sight O
, O
well O
, O
how O
can O
Japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
Russian I-NORP
relations O
develop O
under O
such O
circumstances O
? O

I O
think O
both O
sides O
generally O
know O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
' O
levels O
of O
political O
operations O
, O
knowing O
that O
territorial O
issues O
are O
hard O
to O
resolve O
. O

So O
, O
with O
this O
issue O
having O
gone O
on O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
both O
sides O
may O
have O
a O
bottom O
line O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
they O
wo O
n't O
say O
we O
will O
stay O
opposed O
to O
each O
other O
as O
long O
as O
it O
is O
unresolved O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
it O
may O
be O
like O
this O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
in O
the O
future O
both O
sides O
may O
become O
more O
reasonable O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

That O
is O
, O
looking O
farther O
ahead O
, O
normalization O
of O
relations O
will O
still O
be O
gradually O
developed O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
do O
n't O
always O
get O
stuck O
on O
the O
territorial O
issue O
. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
territorial O
issue O
is O
also O
quite O
important O
and O
sensitive O
. O

So O
it O
is O
unrealistic O
for O
you O
to O
say O
there O
will O
be O
breakthrough O
progress O
in O
Japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
Russian I-NORP
relations O
and O
that O
their O
economic O
and O
trade O
relations O
will O
suddenly O
achieve O
100 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
the O
prospects O
for O
Japanese B-NORP
- I-NORP
Russian I-NORP
relations O
are O
not O
too O
good O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
it O
will O
be O
a O
normal O
, O
that O
is O
, O
very O
common O
, O
very O
, O
relatively O
bland O
kind O
of O
relationship O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
Russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
Japanese I-NORP
relations O
, O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
Russia B-GPE
, O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
many O
changes O
in O
the O
large O
framework O
of O
Russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
Japanese I-NORP
relations O
. O

Well O
, O
Mr. O
Xing B-PERSON
, O
how O
do O
you O
view O
Russian B-NORP
- I-NORP
Japanese I-NORP
relations O
? O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
these O
basic O
tones O
have O
been O
set O
. O

The O
main O
issue O
is O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
northern O
islands O
. O

However O
, O
current O
signs O
show O
that O
Russia B-GPE
and O
Japan B-GPE
are O
moving O
forward O
on O
economic O
issues O
, O
on O
economic O
cooperation O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Yes O
. O

I O
will O
give O
two B-CARDINAL
examples O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
example O
is O
that O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
Toyota B-ORG
Motor I-ORG
has O
invested O
in O
St. B-GPE
Petersburg I-GPE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
Putin B-PERSON
attended O
the O
ribbon O
- O
cutting O
ceremony O
. O

This O
is O
quite O
, O
quite O
a O
clear O
signal O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
Russia O
-- O
Japan B-GPE
has O
now O
invested O
in O
Russia B-GPE
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
what O
Japan B-GPE
hopes O
to O
get O
is O
, O
hey O
, O
Russia B-GPE
's O
oil O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Though O
Russia B-GPE
did O
not O
make O
a O
final O
commitment O
, O
there O
is O
already O
a O
general O
framework O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
eventually O
Russia B-GPE
's O
oil O
pipeline O
will O
be O
connected O
to O
a O
Pacific B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
port O
, O
which O
will O
benefit O
Japan B-GPE
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
although O
there O
are O
obstacles O
in O
bilateral O
relations O
, O
they O
are O
still O
exploring O
forward O
movement O
. O

Right O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Okay O
, O
well O
, O
today B-DATE
we O
will O
end O
our O
discussion O
here O
on O
the O

of O
work O

where O
you O

was O
right O
af- O

I O
mean O
that O
's O
a O
long O
time O
ago O

that O
was O
right O
after O
the O
%um O
the O

the O
doctor O
said O
that O
you O
had O
to O
have O
a O
baby O
because O
of O
your O
your O
ovaries O
or O
whatever O
just O
to O
keep O
everything O
in O
order O

Well O
if O
I O
wanted O
to O
have O
a O
child O
I O
should O
do O
it O
you O
know O

and O
so O
that O
pushed O
me O
. O

He O
said O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
you O
to O
have O
a O
baby O
if O
it O
's O
going O
to O
create O
problems O

but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
have O
one O
this O
is O
the O
time O

and O
it O
actually O
so O
you O
went O
all O
out O

's O
what O
it O
was O
did O
turn O
everything O
around O
for O
me O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
works O
that O
way O
for O
everybody O

but O
those O
hormones O
kind O
of O
took O
care O
of O
the O
problems O
I O
was O
having O
. O

I O
was O
starting O
to O
have O
the O

the O
perfect O
number O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
get O
pregnant O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
time O

I O
it O
just O
kind O
of O
that O
happened O
when O
I O
was O
in O
Honduras B-GPE
last O
time O

that O
was O
really O
so O

mhm O

i- O
I O
was O
so O
angry O
at O
Oscar B-PERSON
that O
I O
just O
knew O
there O
was O
no O
way O
that O
I O
could O
ever O
even O
think O
of O
going O
to O

So O
and O
that O

when O
it O
happened O

but O
I O
love O
my O
little O
baby O

and O
-- O

%huh O

but O

And O
you O
're O
still O
with O
Oscar B-PERSON
right O

that O
's O

well O
we O
're O
still O
married O

but O
he O
's O
doing O
his O
own O
thing O
like O
usual O

so O
I O
pretty O
much O
take O
care O
of O
the O
crew O
all O
alone O
. O

He O
calls O
to O
see O
how O
they O
're O
doing O
and O
%huh O
pops O
in O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
, O

but O
it O
's O
tough O
. O

It O
really O
is O

and O
see O
his O
daughter O
lives O
here O
too O

wow O

she O
's O
kin- O

She O
does O
? O

Well O
, O
she O
has O
since O

well O
I O
think O
they O
've O
been O
here O
five O
years O
now O
, O
five O
years O
this O
summer O
because O
we O
were O
figuring O
that O
they O
could O
apply O
for O
citizenship O
. O
Both O
Oscar B-PERSON
and O
Lehia B-PERSON
%um O
. O

He O
's O
twenty B-DATE

and O
she O
's O
just O
turned O
eighteen B-DATE
now O

Wow O
. O

he O
does O
n't O
live O
here O
%um O
. O

He O
had O
kind O
of O
, O

well O
, O
so O
it O
's O
a O
long O
long O
story O

but O
%um O
at O
one O
point O
when O
I O
got O
real O
irritated O
with O
Oscar B-PERSON
everybody O
in O
the O
family O
insisted O
that O
I O
was O
an O
idiot O
and O
I O
should O
make O
him O
take O
care O
of O
his O
children O
which O
you O
know O
I O
really O
believed O
when O
I O
was O
there O

and O
I O
and O
i- O
I O
mean O
it O
does O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
intellectual O
sense O
, O
I O
guess O
. O

But O
it O
really O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
that O
to O
the O
kids O

but O
I O
did O

and O
so O
I O
sent O
them O
to O
stay O
with O
him O

and O
then O
I O
felt O
bad O
about O
it O
immediately O

and O
then O
he O
would O
n't O
let O
them O
come O
back O

and O
so O
it O
turned O
into O
a O
situation O
where O
Lehia B-PERSON
was O
really O
the O
one O
that O
wanted O
to O
come O
back O
and O
Oscar B-PERSON
junior O
kind O
of O
%um O
decided O
that O
living O
with O
his O
father O
was O
what O
he O
wanted O

mhm O

And O
Lehia B-PERSON
's O
mom O
used O
to O
beg O
him O
to O
let O
her O
come O
back O

and O
he O
'd O
say O
yes O

and O
then O
he O
'd O
hang O
up O
the O
phone O

and O
he O
'd O
say O
I O
'd O
never O
let O
you O
go O
back O
there O
you O
know O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
was O
real O
stupid O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
really O
that O
he O
wanted O
her O
around O

but O
it O
was O
just O
it O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

People O
do O
stupid O
things O
. O

%hm O
. O

oh O

%hm O
so O
they O
're O
living O
with O
him O
? O

No O
, O

%um O
now O
how O
long O
? O

Probably O
two O
years O
ago O
then O
we O
she O
and O
I O
worked O
it O
out O
where O
I O
got O
power O
of O
attorney O
from O
her O
mom O
because O
her O
mom O
always O
had O
custody O

and O
she O
called O
me O
one O
day O
when O
there O
was O
nobody O
in O
the O

saying O
that O
it O
living O
with O
his O
father O
was O
n't O

, O
he O
kind O
of O
had O

his O

an O
apartment O
. O

They O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
burden O

which O
is O
great O
. O

maybe O
farther O
, O
about O
a O

sometime O
next B-DATE
week I-DATE

yeah O

but O
that O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
in O
a O
nutshell O
all O
the O
things O
that O
have O
been O
going O
on O

and O

Wow O

I O

Well O
it O
's O
interesting O
. O

Are O
you O
working O

or O
are O
you O
teaching O
? O

oh O
yes O
. O

Well O
I O
do O
n't O
teach O

%um O
I O

yeah O
? O

let O
's O
see O
, O

well O
I O
came O
back O

I O
I O
taught O
adult O
basic O
education O
because O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
job O
in O
home O
ec O
which O
is O

it O
's O
probably O
still O
that O
way O

and O
I O
went O
for O
my O
masters O
in O
counseling O

and O
uh-huh O
%um O
actually O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
come O
back O
and O
be O
the O
counselor O
at O
the O
American B-NORP
school O

and O
that O
was O
the O
year O
I O
was O
pregnant O
with O
Noel B-PERSON

and O
I O
was O
really O
torn O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O

but O
my O
doctor O
did O
n't O
want O
me O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Honduras B-GPE
because O
I O
'd O
been O
so O
sick O
before O
. O

He O
felt O
that O
y- O

mhm O
. O

I O
really O
needed O
. O

We O
did O
n't O
know O
how O
the O
pregnancy O
was O
going O
to O
go O

but O
I O
I O
feel O
like O

I O
really O
I O
mean O
I O
was O
n't O
really O
paying O
that O
much O
attention O
to O
what O
he O
said O

but O
that O
did O
influence O
a O
little O
bit O
. O

so O
I O
did O
n't O
go O

%hm O
. O

and O
%uh O
, O
let O
's O
see O
, O

what O
would O
I O
, O

I O
guess O
I O
was O
working O
part O
time O
that O
year O
doing O
part O
time O
counseling O
jobs O

and O
then O
that B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
I O
had O
two B-CARDINAL
o- O
well O
I O
had O
one B-CARDINAL
offer O
that O
I O
had O
to O
take O
. O

The O
other O
one O
was O
we O
were O
waiting O
for O
a O
principal O
to O
come O
back O
%um O

mhm O
. O

but O
I O
ended O
up O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
go O
into O
high O
school O
counseling O

but O
I O
could O
n't O
because O
the O
principal O
was O
out O
on O
this O
boat O
they O
told O
me O
and O
he O
c- O
had O
to O
make O
the O
decision O

it O
's O
like O
oh O
I O
need O
th- O
I O
need O
this O
need O
to O
know O
fast O
because O
I O
'm O
pregnant O
and O
I O
can O
not O
, O
you O
know O
, O
risk O
losing O
a O
job O
. O

So O
I O
ended O
up O
working O
at O
the O
Sure O
. O
community O
college O
which O
was O
n't O
what O
I O
wanted O
at O
the O
time O

but O
a- O
as O
it O
's O
turned O
out O
it O
probably O
was O
the O
best O
%um O

and O
I O
like O
it O
real O
well O
. O

I O
l- O
I O
was O
cou- O
I O
counseled O
for O
about O
five O
years O

and O
now O
I O
'm O
in O
administration O
%um O

oh O
great O

" O
It O

you O
have O
to O

It O

that O
you O

She O

and O
then O
seals O
the O

For O
Mrs. O

, O
the O

The O
timing O
of O
Chinese B-EVENT
New I-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
is O
determined O
by O
the O
traditional O
lunar O
calendar O
and O
marks O
an O
important O
transition O
, O
the O
point O
when O
Winter O
gives O
way O
to O
Spring O
. O

In O
China B-GPE
, O
a O
country O
founded O
on O
farming O
, O
there O
has O
always O
been O
a O
tangible O
link O
between O
seasonal O
changes O
and O
the O
pattern O
of O
agricultural O
production O
. O

As O
this O
link O
was O
absorbed O
into O
people O

lives O
it O
gave O
rise O
to O
the O
rituals O
of O
rural O
existence O
, O
the O
most O

of O
which O
marked O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O

the O

. O

Thus O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
became O
the O
most O
important O
of O
all O
traditional O
festivals O
, O
symbolizing O
endless O

and O
the O

of O
the O

New B-EVENT

also O
, O
through O
its O

to O

about O

and O

. O

The O
attitudes O

of O
the O

are O
also O
given O

However O
, O
as O
China B-GPE
covers O
such O
a O
vast O
territory O
, O
this O
pudding O
comes O
in O
different O
versions O
according O

For O

, O
people O
in O
the O

generally O
eat O
" O
Ningpo B-GPE

: O
" O
Although O
my O

the O

every B-EVENT

to O
make O

for O

So O
when O
we O
spent O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
in O
Shanghai B-GPE
, O
we O
did O
n't O
have O
Ningpo B-GPE

, O
and O
when O

we O
did O

the O

that O

No O

where O

it O
was O

" O

Lin B-PERSON
recalls O
that O
there O
were O
so O
many O

to O
feed O
at O
New B-EVENT

that O
they O
had O
to O
use O
two B-CARDINAL

three B-CARDINAL
large O

to O
make O
the O

. O

Come O
New B-EVENT

, O
the O
children O
were O
always O
attracted O
by O
the O
unusually O
busy O
atmosphere O
in O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
loved O
running O
in O
and O
out O
to O
check O
on O
what O
was O
going O
on O
, O
meanwhile O
getting O
under O
everyone O

Lin B-PERSON
's O
mother O
was O
n't O
too O
happy O
about O
this O

the O

Dinner O
was O
nearly O
over O
when O
the O
old O

demanded O
that O
his O

come O
to O

side O

announced O
: O
" O
I O

each O
in O

" O

He O
began O
to O
lecture O
them O
about O
how O
hard O
he O
had O
struggled O
in O
his O
youth O
to O
bring O
them O
all O
up O
, O
recalling O
every O
little O

as O
though O
it O

yesterday B-DATE

He O
broke O
down O
in O
tears O
once O
he O
got O
onto O
the O
things O
that O
had O
hurt O
him O
, O
and O
after O
that O
there O
was O
no O
calming O
him O
down O
. O

" O
He O
had O
absolutely O
no O
idea O
that O
his O
children O
all O
had O
to O
swallow O
their O
own O
share O
of O
hurt O
and O
disappointment O
while O
growing O
up O
, O
but O
never O
complained O
to O
him O
. O

Now O
each O
of O
them O
felt O
afresh O
the O
grievances O
of O
childhood O
, O
and O
began O
to O
strike O
back O
, O
one O
after O
another O
. O
" O

Li B-PERSON
described O
the O
ensuing O
scenario O
: O

" O
Some O
wheeled O
out O
their O
heavy O
artillery O
and O
some O
used O
the O
machine O
- O
gun O
approach O
. O

Cannon O
and O
gunfire O
rang O
out O
on O
that O
cold O
rainy O
night O
, O
while O
tears O
flowed O
and O
fireworks O
exploded O
. O

The O
old O
bruiser O
, O
nearly B-DATE
80 I-DATE
years I-DATE
old O
, O
was O
struck O
speechless O
. O

His O
authority O
lay O
in O
tatters O
, O
long O
since O
torn O
down O
by O
his O
adult O
offspring O
. O

He O
'd O
taken O
so O
many O
hits O
by O
then O
that O
he O
was O
riddled O
with O
bullet O
- O
holes O
. O

He O
slumped O
miserably O
back O
into O
his O
chair O
, O
lips O
quivering O
as O
if O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
no O
words O

" O

The O
evening O
ended O
in O
tears O

awkwardness O

" O
Our O
family O
was O
quite O
poor O
when O
we O
were O
growing O
up O
, O
" O
says O
Li B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
Father O
suffered O
plenty O
of O
frustrations O
on O
our O

He O
thought O
that O
we O
had O
n't O
properly O
repaid O
him O
once O
we O
had O
grown O
up O
, O
and O
felt O
quite O
bitter O
about O
it O

But O
he O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O
we O
too O
, O
growing O
up O
in O
such O
circumstances O
, O
faced O
hardship O
and O
frustration O
. O

Like O
my O
elder O

who O
had O
to O
work O
her O
way O
through O

Everyone O
had O
something O

get O
off O

It O
all O
got O
quite O
heated O

" O

Li O
felt O
depressed O

guilty O
about O
the O
way O
the O
evening O
turned O
out O

When O
he O
went O
over O

I O
like O
the O
unusual O

that O
descends O
on O

for O
the O
period O
of O
the O

and O
since O
we O
did O

want O
to O

just O
stayed O

" O

, O
" O
is O
a O
way O
of O
bringing O
new O
meaning O
into O
the O
old O
tradition O
, O
a O
way O
of O
spending O
New B-EVENT

that O
suits O
ordinary O
people O
. O
" O

Yang B-PERSON
's O
strongest O
association O
with O

is O
of O
going O
to O
do O
the O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
's I-EVENT
shopping O
with O
the O
grown O
- O
ups O
when O
she O
was O
little O
. O

" O
We O
were O
always O
very O
thrifty O
in O
those O
days O
, O
without O
extra O
cash O
for O
new O
things O
. O

New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
was O
the O
only O
time O
when O
we O
got O
to O
bring O
bulging O
bags O
and O
packages O
back O
to O
the O
house O
. O

Just O
the O
sight O
of O
all O
those O
treats O
- O
chicken O
, O
duck O
, O
fish O
and O
pork O
; O
candies O
and O
cookies O
; O
fruits O
and O
soda O
drinks O
- O
was O
a O
thrill O
for O
us O
. O

Then O
there O
were O
all O
the O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
presents O
, O
like O
new O
clothes O
, O
shoes O
and O
hats O
. O

At O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
our O
parents O
liked O
to O
dress O
the O
girls O
in O
red O
from O
head O
to O
toe O
, O
for O
good O
luck O
and O
for O
fun O
. O

We O
looked O
as O
if O
we O
'd O
been O
dipped O
in O
a O
tub O
of O
haw O
juice O
. O
" O

In O
spite O
of O
the O
excitement O
that O
she O
remembered O
feeling O
, O
as O
a O
child O
, O
about O
getting O
to O
wear O
new O
clothes O
and O
new O
hats O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
later O
began O
to O
question O
this O
way O
of O
spending O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
. O

She O
felt O
especially O
turned O
off O
by O
the O
orgy O
of O
consumption O
connected O
with O
the O
festival O
. O

" O
It O
was O
only O
after O
I O
had O
kids O
of O
my O
own O
that O
I O
began O
to O
rethink O
the O
importance O
of O
New B-EVENT
Year I-EVENT
- O
partly O
out O
of O
nostalgia O
, O
and O
partly O
to O
pass O
the O
tradition O
on O
to O
my O
children O
, O
" O
admits O
Yang B-PERSON
. O

Nowadays O
she O
emphasizes O
just O
three B-CARDINAL
aspects O
of O
the O
occasion O
: O
getting O
the O
family O
together O
, O
enjoying O
the O
festive O
spirit O
, O
and O
having O
a O
rest O
. O

" O
At O
one B-CARDINAL
point O
we O
tried O
the O
fashionable O
thing O
, O
taking O
the O
family O
away O
for O
a O
vacation O
, O
but O
being O
abroad O
we O
really O
missed O
that O
festive O
flavor O
. O
" O

Eventually O
she O
returned O
to O
the O
traditional O
form O
, O
making O
the B-EVENT
New I-EVENT
Year I-EVENT

Eve I-EVENT
dinner O
herself O
, O
and O
always O
including O
a O
Manchurian B-NORP

as O
it O

we O
decided O
to O
drop O
the O
formal O

gathering O

Instead O
, O
we O
now O
spend O
the O

we O
fancy O

feels O
that O
if O
we O
redefine O
New B-EVENT

in O
terms O
of O
its O
contemplative O

spiritual O
meaning O
, O
rather O
than O
just O
regarding O
it O
as O
an O
occasion O
for O

then O
we O

better O

see O
that O

who O
spoke O
out O
against O

today B-DATE
. O

I O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
can O
do O
a O
very O
good O
job O
there O
. O

I O
think O
he O
's O
going O
to O
hurt O
the O
president O
more O
importantly O
going O
to O
hurt O
the O
country O
. O

I O
think O
the O
nomination O
is O
a O
-- O
is O
a O
bad O
one O
. O

I O
think O
the O
wa- O
way O
he O
's O
arriving O
there O
is O
a O
-- O
is O
a O
-- O
is O
a O
very O
bad O
idea O
. O

NBC B-ORG
's O
David B-PERSON
Gregory I-PERSON
is O
at O
the B-FAC
White I-FAC
House I-FAC
. O

David B-PERSON
you O
know O
the O
president O
does O
n't O
he O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
looking O
like O
the O
little O
rich O
kid O
who O
is O
not O
winning O
the O
game O
so O
he O
says O
it O
's O
my O
ball O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
home O
with O
it O
? O

Well O
I O
have O
a O
theory O
about O
this O
Chris B-PERSON
which O
is O
that O
every O
time O
somebody O
accuses O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
about O
being O
abrasive O
or O
abusive O
to O
subordinates O
or O
you O
know O
difficult O
to O
work O
with O
as O
somebody O
who O
is O
just O
going O
to O
break O
all O
the O
china O
in O
the O
place O
the O
president O
says O
oh O
yeah O
this O
is O
why O
I O
like O
the O
guy O
. O

this O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
want O
at O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
. O

And O
I O
'm O
-- O
I O
'm O
only O
half O
kidding O
. O

I O
really O
think O
that O
that O
is O
a O
big O
part O
of O
this O
that O
the O
president O
uh O
yes O
he O
may O
be O
ruffling O
feathers O
here O
but O
he O
does O
n't O
mind O
if O
he O
-- O
to O
deal O
with O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
the O
president O
wants O
to O
do O
it O
in O
a O
pretty O
hardline O
way O
. O

But O
it O
uh O
but O
does O
n't O
-- O
well O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
this O
about O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
appointment O
because O
he O
can O
only O
be O
appointed O
through O
uh O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
next O
session O
of O
Congress B-ORG
which O
is O
in O
early B-DATE
oh I-DATE
seven I-DATE
it O
's O
really O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

how O
can O
he O
really O
be O
a O
permanent O
representative O
and O
have O
the O
stature O
of O
one O
? O

Well O
I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
big O
question O
. O

Uh O
I O
me- O
It O
is O
a O
question O
that O
was O
posed O
to O
the O
UN B-ORG
secretary O
- O
general O
today B-DATE
. O

I O
mean O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
the O
president O
has O
got O
some O
time O
to O
work O
with O
him O
. O

He O
has O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
up O
there O
. O

He O
knows O
he O
has O
got O
you O
know O
the O
president O
's O
authority O
. O

Everybody O
up O
there O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
understands O
that O
as O
well O
that O
he O
can O
push O
the O
the O
US B-GPE
agenda O
. O

And O
then O
we O
'll O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

I O
mean O
if O
he O
can O
prove O
to O
some O
Democrats B-NORP
that O
uh O
he O
can O
work O
well O
with O
others O
up O
there O
perhaps O
he O
changes O
some O
minds O
. O

Maybe O
that O
's O
-- O
uh O
that O
's O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

but O
the O
bottom O
line O
this O
is O
that O
this O
is O
not O
an O
administration O
that O
thinks O
very O
highly O
of O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
. O

and O
the O
only O
real O
engagement O
we O
want O
to O
have O
at O
the O
UN B-ORG
is O
to O
try O
to O
clean O
the O
place O
up O
. O

And O
so O
they O
're O
going O
to O
stand O
by O
the O
guy O
they O
think O
who O
can O
really O
do O
that O
. O

and O
this O
is O
very O
much O
a O
statement O
that O
the O
president O
was O
not O
going O
to O
be O
deterred O
from O
making O
in O
terms O
of O
his O
views O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
and O
how O
it O
ought O
to O
operate O
. O

How O
ra- O
how O
big O
a O
role O
has O
the O
vice O
president O
had O
in O
this O
appointment O
and O
this O
continuation O
to O
fight O
for O
him O
to O
the O
point O
of O
naming O
him O
a O
recess O
appointment O
? O

I O
think O
huge O
. O

And O
and O
in O
fact O
it O
's O
the O
vice O
president O
who O
's O
very O
close O
to O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
, O
who O
has O
been O
a O
real O
stalwart O
for O
him O
throughout O
this O
process O
. O

And O
I O
think O
it O
's O
perfectly O
clear O
that O
uh O
that O
he O
made O
the O
argument O
to O
the O
president O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
wobble O
on O
this O
one O
, O
that O
this O
is O
an O
important O
player O
in O
our O
agenda O
with O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
. O

Okay O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
David B-PERSON
Gregory I-PERSON
. O

Republican B-NORP
Senator O
Norm B-PERSON
Coleman I-PERSON
of O
Minnesota B-GPE
is O
a O
member O
of O
the B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Relations I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
which O
held O
the O
nomination O
hearings O
on O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
. O

Senator O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
about O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
. O

The O
president O
referred O
to O
a O
handful O
of O
Democrats B-NORP
. O

Who O
is O
he O
talking O
about O
. O

who O
held O
up O
this O
nomination O
? O

Well O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
there O
were O
fifty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
votes O
for O
cloture O
. O

so O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
Senate B-ORG
supported O
ending O
the O
debate O
. O

I O
think O
Bolton B-PERSON
would O
have O
gotten O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
fifty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
votes O
to O
be O
confirmed O
. O

so O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
Senate B-ORG
supported O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
. O

and O
in O
most O
democracies O
majorities O
actually O
get O
their O
way O
. O

Senate B-ORG
procedure O
allows O
a O
minority O
to O
block O
this O
nomin- O
nomination O
. O

and O
they O
did O
. O

Chris B-PERSON
two B-CARDINAL
other O
things O
. O

the O
bottom O
line O
is O
you O
're O
forgetting O
there O
's O
a O
conference O
on O
UN B-ORG
reform O
major O
conference O
September B-DATE
fourteenth I-DATE
through I-DATE
the I-DATE
sixteenth I-DATE
. O

The O
president O
is O
going O
to O
be O
there O
make O
a O
major O
statement O
now O
he O
has O
got O
somebody O
who O
is O
there O
, O
who O
is O
his O
guy O
, O
who O
is O
going O
to O
work O
with O
him O
over O
these B-DATE
six I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

This O
is O
an O
important O
period O
of O
time O
. O

We O
've O
been O
six B-DATE
months I-DATE
without O
a O
permanent O
representative O
. O

The O
time O
was O
to O
do O
it O
now O
. O

and O
the O
president O
I O
believe O
did O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

Let O
's O
listen O
to O
Senator O
and O
former O
former O
Majority O
leader O
Trent B-PERSON
Lott I-PERSON
of O
Mississippi B-GPE
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
senator O
from O
that O
state O
. O

Here O
's O
what O
he O
said O
that O
he O
opposed O
the O
recess O
appointment O
of O
uh O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
. O

I O
have O
advised O
against O
it O
. O

Uh O
I O
think O
that O
he O
was O
not O
confirmed O
. O

And O
if O
he O
went O
in O
there O
he O
would O
be O
limited O
to O
like B-DATE
seventeen I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

Uh O
perhaps O
uh O
he O
would O
not O
be O
weakened O
. O

but O
uh O
you O
know O
it O
it O
appears O
to O
me O
that O
he O
would O
. O

Uh O
but O
uh O
I O
I O
would O
recommend O
against O
a O
recess O
appointment O
. O

What O
do O
you O
make O
of O
that O
Senator O
Coleman B-PERSON
? O

I O
disagree O
with O
my O
my O
friend O
and O
respected O
colleague O
Trent B-PERSON
Lott I-PERSON
. O

Bottom O
line O
is O
that O
this O
is O
an O
important O
moment O
. O

This O
UN B-ORG
is O
is O
reeling O
from O
the O
aftermath O
of O
the O
investigation O
that O
we O
've O
done O
on O
oil O
for O
food O
. O

And O
they O
've O
been O
reeling O
from O
from O
the O
child O
prostitution O
in O
Africa B-LOC
from O
the O
sexual O
harassment O
of O
top O
UN B-ORG
personnel O
. O

They O
finally O
understand O
they O
have O
got O
to O
make O
change O
. O

Uh O
hopefully O
get O
a B-PERSON
John I-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
who O
can O
force O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
and O
Zimbabwe B-GPE
and O
Sudan B-GPE
to O
understand O
that O
we O
have O
got O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
odious O
Human B-ORG
Rights I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
. O

And O
so O
the O
time O
is O
now O
. O

Eh O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
is O
only O
going O
to O
be O
in O
office O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

that O
that O
that O
's O
how O
permanent O
permanent O
will O
be O
. O

Uh O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
will O
be O
there O
during O
probably O
the O
most O
important O
time O
for O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
in O
many B-DATE
many I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Do O
you O
think O
there O
's O
a O
value O
in O
itself O
in O
having O
someone O
to O
go O
up O
there O
and O
just O
waste O
the O
place O
I O
mean O
in O
other O
words O
just O
give O
tough O
speeches O
try O
to O
humiliate O
them O
uh O
try O
to O
get O
them O
out O
and O
get O
them O
straightened O
out O
by O
just O
making O
fun O
of O
them O
by O
basically O
trashing O
some O
of O
those O
Third B-LOC
World I-LOC
members O
that O
have O
contributed O
to O
this O
uh O
horror O
in O
some O
of O
these O
cases O
you O
mentioned O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
anyone O
-- O
uh O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
's O
-- O
there O
's O
any O
basis O
for O
saying O
that O
's O
what O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
do O
. O

John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
by O
the O
way O
was O
a O
very O
effective O
assistant O
of O
state O
. O

He O
helped O
the O
UN B-ORG
get O
rid O
of O
its O
odious O
Zionism B-NORP
is O
racism O
resolution O
in O
nineteen B-DATE
ninety I-DATE
- I-DATE
one I-DATE
when O
people O
said O
that O
could O
n't O
be O
done O
. O

So O
do O
n't O
underestimate O
the O
skill O
of O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
. O

Is O
there O
a O
time O
to O
be O
tough O
? O

Yeah O
. O

And O
he O
can O
be O
tough O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
time O
to O
be O
persuasive O
? O

Yeah O
. O

He O
can O
be O
persuasive O
. O

He O
's O
got O
a O
record O
of O
doing O
that O
. O

UN B-ORG
officials O
themselves O
have O
said O
that O
. O

Malloch B-PERSON
Brown I-PERSON
has O
said O
that O
. O

Kofi B-PERSON
Annan I-PERSON
has O
said O
that O
. O

So O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
simply O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
as O
a O
tough O
guy O
who O
is O
going O
to O
push O
folks O
around O
. O

But O
he O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
things O
done O
. O

The O
moment O
for O
reform O
is O
now O
. O

and O
if O
we O
miss O
that O
moment O
shame O
on O
us O
. O

Do O
you O
worry O
about O
him O
rattling O
the O
cage O
of O
uh O
the O
head O
of O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
with O
comments O
like O
he O
's O
a O
tyrannical O
dictator O
? O

You O
're O
dealing O
with O
a O
guy O
who O
is O
living O
on O
booze O
most O
of O
the O
time O
and O
delusions O
and O
movies O
and O
girlfriends O
provided O
for O
him O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
safe O
to O
call O
him O
names O
? O

You O
're O
not O
talking O
about O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
now O
when O
you O
say O
that O
, O
right O
? O

No O
I O
'm O
talking O
about O
the O
head O
of O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
's O
safe O
to O
to O
rattle O
the O
cage O
of O
a O
crazy O
man O
? O

Uh O
Chris B-PERSON
as O
you O
-- O
Chris B-PERSON
as O
as O
as O
you O
well O
know O
- O

I O
should O
n't O
say O
crazy O
man O
. O

He O
might O
hear O
this O
. O

How O
about O
an O
unusual O
leader O
? O

Eh O
everything O
that O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
said O
about O
Kim B-PERSON
Jong I-PERSON
was O
approved O
by O
the B-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
. O

There O
's O
not O
a O
record O
on O
it O
not O
a O
single O
thing O
in O
the O
record O
. O

I O
sat O
through O
all O
the O
*hearings O
hearings O
and O
read O
all O
the O
stuff O
. O

there O
's O
not O
a O
single O
thing O
that O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
said O
that O
was O
n't O
approved O
by O
higher O
powers O
. O

Tyrannical O
dictator O
hellish O
nightmare O
on O
the B-DATE
eve I-DATE
of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
nation O
talks O
? O

That O
's O
what O
he O
is O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
we O
know O
that O
. O

The O
truth O
hurts O
so O
much O
with O
this O
guy O
- O

So O
your O
listeners O
understand O
-- O
your O
listeners O
understand O
there O
's O
not O
a O
single O
thing O
that O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
said O
during O
that O
entire O
process O
that O
was O
not O
vetted O
, O
that O
was O
not O
cleared O
and O
that O
was O
not O
approved O
. O

So O
he O
is O
a O
tyrannical O
dictator O
for O
whatever O
reason O
folks O
said O
. O

that O
's O
the O
-- O
that O
's O
the O
approach O
we O
're O
going O
to O
use O
. O

and O
so O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
was O
n't O
off O
the O
reservation O
and O
was O
n't O
speaking O
out O
of O
school O
. O

he O
was O
speaking O
truth O
. O

and O
it O
was O
approved O
truth O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
about O
his O
comment O
that O
we O
we O
we O
could O
lose O
the O
top O
ten B-CARDINAL
floors O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
building O
and O
it O
would O
n't O
hurt O
? O

I O
hope O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
an O
office O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
top O
ten B-CARDINAL
floors O
. O

Uh O
yeah O
you O
sound O
like O
Barbara B-PERSON
Boxer I-PERSON
now O
Chris B-PERSON
. O

You O
know O
the O
reality O
he O
was O
saying O
that O
-- O
he O
was O
saying O
that O
-- O
he O
was O
saying O
that O
comment O
to O
a O
group O
-- O
he O
was O
saying O
that O
comment O
to O
a O
group O
of O
folks O
. O

It O
was O
-- O
it O
was O
a O
meeting O
in O
which O
they O
're O
talking O
about O
one B-CARDINAL
world O
government O
. O

He O
was O
saying O
hey O
folks O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

Oh O
do O
n't O
. O

no O
no O
. O

now O
now O
we O
're O
at O
war O
. O

What O
did O
you O
just O
say O
? O

Uh O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

It O
's O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

And O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
folks O
would O
say O
the O
UN B-ORG
has O
not O
been O
as O
effective O
as O
it O
should O
be O
. O

My O
investigation O
has O
*shown O
shown O
mismanagement O
at O
least O
perhaps O
corruption O
at O
worst O
. O

Right O
. O

An- O
and O
so O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
folks O
saying O
you O
got O
to O
make O
change O
in O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O

That O
's O
what O
that O
was O
all O
about O
. O

And O
the O
UN B-ORG
recognized O
it O
now O
. O

That O
's O
why O
they O
're O
holding O
this O
meeting O
on O
reform O
. O

That O
's O
why O
the O
president O
is O
going O
to O
be O
speaking O
there O
. O

And O
he O
has O
got O
a O
guy O
by O
his O
side O
who O
can O
help O
make O
that O
happen O
. O

So O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
quoted O
him O
. O

I O
made O
a O
mistake O
there O
Senator O
. O

You O
you O
you O
just O
jumped O
on O
me O
because O
I O
quoted O
him O
saying O
it O
would O
be O
all O
right O
if O
they O
lost O
the O
top O
ten B-CARDINAL
floors O
of O
the O
UN B-FAC
. O

And O
and O
was O
I O
wrong O
to O
do O
that O
? O

No O
. O

it O
was O
a O
comment O
. O

it O
eh O
eh O
it O
was O
n't O
-- O
it O
was O
n't O
your O
quote O
. O

it O
was O
your O
comment O
eh O
that O
you O
said O
how O
would O
you O
feel O
if O
you O
were O
on O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
floors O
. O

Tell O
me O
what O
you O
should O
do O
here O
. O

That O
's O
what O
Brabara B-PERSON
Boxer I-PERSON
said O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
our O
hearings O
. O

Oh O
did O
she O
say O
that O
? O

Oh O
oh O
that O
was O
a O
mistake O
on O
my O
part O
. O

Yeah O
absolutely O
. O

and O
the O
and O
the O
reality O
-- O
wait O
and O
the O
reality O
is O
again O
the O
context O
in O
which O
he O
said O
that O
was O
very O
clear O
I O
think O
few O
would O
argue O
with O
it O
and O
that O
is O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
a O
one B-CARDINAL
world O
government O
. O

The O
UN B-ORG
is O
not O
going O
to O
dictate O
American B-NORP
foreign O
policy O
and O
how O
America B-GPE
defends O
itself O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
we O
need O
to O
work O
with O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O

John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
has O
showed O
the O
ability O
to O
do O
that O
. O

and O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
mistake O
to O
mischaracterize O
him O
simply O
as O
a O
tough O
or O
a O
tough O
guy O
or O
a O
bully O
. O

Did O
it O
bother O
you O
that O
when O
he O
filled O
out O
that O
questionnaire O
in O
the O
-- O
uh O
uh O
be- O
before O
your O
Senate B-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Relations I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
your O
committee O
that O
he O
failed O
to O
note O
, O
in O
fact O
he O
denied O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
interviewed O
as O
part O
of O
the O
uh O
uh O
inspector O
general O
's O
investigation O
of O
the O
initial O
causes O
for O
the O
war O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
? O

Yeah O
it O
does O
bother O
-- O
it O
bothers O
me O
any O
time O
uh O
s- O
somebody O
says O
something O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
not O
to O
be O
accurate O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
if O
he O
was O
simply O
somebody O
that O
somebody O
talked O
to O
but O
there O
is O
n't O
any O
indication O
he O
was O
involved O
central O
to O
the O
story O
I O
have O
less O
concern O
. O

But O
does O
it O
bother O
me O
? O

Yes O
it O
did O
. O

I O
wish O
it O
did O
n't O
happen O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
UN B-ORG
can O
still O
play O
the O
role O
that O
FDR B-PERSON
and O
the O
other O
Americans B-NORP
at O
that O
time O
thought O
it O
could O
of O
being O
the O
peacemaking O
uh O
organization O
to O
keep O
us O
from O
fighting O
war O
after O
war O
in O
the O
world O
? O

Can O
they O
ever O
play O
that O
role O
? O

Chris B-PERSON
I O
I O
hope O
so O
. O

and O
I O
think O
that O
's O
the O
importance O
of O
this O
whole O
UN B-ORG
reform O
effort O
. O

That O
's O
what O
this O
is O
about O
uh O
that O
we O
really O
do O
have O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
the B-ORG
Human I-ORG
Rights I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
. O

We O
have O
to O
change O
the O
focus O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
so O
they O
're O
not O
spending O
one B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
sixty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
nine I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
on O
their O
communications O
department O
and O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
four I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
on O
their O
auditing O
function O
. O

Uh O
we O
've O
got O
to O
do O
structural O
reform O
. O

We O
've O
-- O
we O
've O
got O
to O
do O
internal O
management O
reform O
. O

If O
it O
does O
that O
then O
in O
fact O
the O
UN B-ORG
can O
live O
out O
what O
it O
-- O
what O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
. O

It O
's O
not O
doing O
that O
today B-DATE
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
change O
it O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
US B-GPE
can O
be O
the O
so- O
world O
's O
sole O
peacekeeper O
and O
world O
's O
sole O
humanitarian O
providers O
. O

So O
we O
need O
an O
effective O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
. O

It O
's O
presently O
scarred O
presently O
tainted O
. O

Uh O
let O
's O
get O
about O
reform O
. O

and O
hopefully O
it O
can O
get O
to O
where O
FDR B-PERSON
thought O
it O
could O
be O
. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
Sen- O
Senator O
Norm B-PERSON
Coleman I-PERSON
of O
Minnesota B-GPE
a O
perfect O
guest O

When O
we O
come O
back O
reaction O
from O
Democrats B-NORP
to O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
recent O
recess O
appointment O
of O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
plus O
what O
is O
the O
significance O
of O
the O
timing O
of O
today B-DATE
's O
Bolton B-PERSON
recess O
appointment O
? O

That O
's O
ahead O
. O

You O
're O
watching O
Hardball B-WORK_OF_ART
only O
on O
MSNBC B-ORG
. O

Coming O
up O
, O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
says O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
is O
the O
right O
person O
for O
the O
job O
. O

but O
Democrats B-NORP
call O
him O
damaged O
goods O
. O

The O
fight O
over O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
recess O
appointment O
to O
the O
UN B-ORG
when O
Hardball B-WORK_OF_ART

Welcome O
back O
to O
Hardball B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

President O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
recess O
appointment O
of O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
as O
UN B-ORG
ambassador O
may O
be O
controversial O
among O
Democrats B-NORP
. O

but O
it O
's O
not O
without O
precedent O
. O

and O
the O
move O
has O
energized O
both O
sides O
as O
they O
prepare O
for O
the O
next O
battle O
. O

Hardball B-WORK_OF_ART
correspondent O
David B-PERSON
Shuster I-PERSON
reports O
. O

After O
urging O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
not O
to O
go O
through O
with O
this O
recess O
appointment O
the O
reaction O
today B-DATE
from O
Democrats B-NORP
was O
harsh O
. O

This O
man O
uh O
sadly O
if O
we O
had O
a O
secret O
roll O
call O
would O
not O
be O
approved O
by O
the O
Senate B-ORG
. O

both O
in O
the O
Democratic B-NORP
and O
Republicans B-NORP
sides O
serious O
misgivings O
about O
whether O
he O
has O
the O
qualifications O
for O
this O
important O
assignment O
. O

And O
some O
Democrats B-NORP
said O
the O
president O
's O
action O
is O
a O
stick O
in O
the O
eye O
just O
as O
the O
Senate B-ORG
is O
preparing O
for O
confirmation O
hearings O
of O
John B-PERSON
Roberts I-PERSON
the O
president O
's O
nominee O
for O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
. O

This O
president O
has O
more O
disdain O
for O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
Congress B-ORG
than O
any O
president O
I O
've O
seen O
in O
my O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
there O
. O

The O
president O
's O
power O
to O
make O
recess O
appointments O
comes O
from O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
. O

And O
it O
's O
a O
power O
that O
dates O
back O
to O
George B-PERSON
Washington I-PERSON
. O

Our O
nation O
's O
founding O
father O
recessed O
John B-PERSON
Rutledge I-PERSON
on O
to O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
only O
to O
see O
him O
formally O
rejected O
by O
the O
Senate B-ORG
after O
one B-CARDINAL
term O
. O

President O
Reagan B-PERSON
made O
two B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
forty I-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
recess O
appointments O
. O

President O
Clinton B-PERSON
made O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
forty I-CARDINAL
. O

And O
to O
date O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
made O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
. O

President O
Clinton B-PERSON
's O
recess O
appointments O
included O
James B-PERSON
Hormel I-PERSON
an O
openly O
gay O
man O
Republicans B-NORP
opposed O
to O
be O
ambassador O
to O
Luxembourg B-GPE
and O
Judge O
Roger B-PERSON
Gregory I-PERSON
. O

I O
have O
tried O
for O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
to O
put O
an B-NORP
African I-NORP
- I-NORP
American I-NORP
on O
the B-ORG
fourth I-ORG
Circuit I-ORG
for O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Now O
on O
uh O
and O
uh O
for O
all O
the O
reasons O
that O
I O
made O
in O
my O
stated O
-- O
in O
in O
my O
remarks O
uh O
I O
think O
it O
is O
most O
unfortunate O
that O
it O
has O
not O
been O
done O
. O

and O
I O
am O
just O
determined O
to O
do O
it O
. O

It O
's O
just O
time O
to O
do O
it O
. O

For O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
recess O
appointments O
have O
gone O
to O
conservative O
Judges O
Charles B-PERSON
Pickering I-PERSON

William B-PERSON
Pryor I-PERSON
Labor B-ORG
Department I-ORG
Solicitor O
Eugene B-PERSON

Otto B-PERSON
Reich I-PERSON
a O
key O
figure O
in O
the O
Reagan B-PERSON
administration O
's O
policies O
toward O
Nicaragua B-GPE
. O

But O
political O
analysts O
say O
Washington B-ORG
is O
more O
bitterly O
divided O
now O
than O
it O
has O
been O
in O
years B-DATE
. O

And O
the O
Bolton B-PERSON
nomination O
fight O
was O
particularly O
intense O
. O

He O
has O
a O
record O
of O
trying O
to O
remove O
intelligence O
analysts O
who O
disagreed O
with O
him O
. O

and O
he O
also O
attempted O
to O
exaggerate O
intelligence O
to O
fit O
his O
views O
. O

This B-DATE
spring I-DATE
Democrats B-NORP
also O
played O
decade O
old O
tapes O
of O
Bolton B-PERSON
disparaging O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O

The B-FAC
Secretariat I-FAC
Building I-FAC
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
has O
thirty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
eight I-CARDINAL
stories O
. O

If O
you O
lost O
ten B-CARDINAL
stories O
today B-DATE
it O
would O
n't O
make O
a O
bit O
of O
difference O
. O

Republicans B-NORP
said O
his O
Bolton B-PERSON
's O
skepticism O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
combined O
with O
his O
hard O
working O
style O
would O
make O
him O
a O
perfect O
choice O
. O

The B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
is O
in O
trouble O
. O

It O
needs O
a O
strong O
voice O
from O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

to O
help O
reform O
this O
vital O
institution O
and O
make O
it O

powerful O
for O
the O

that O
we O

the O
old O

really O
came O

. O

What O
are O
we O
looking O
at O
here O
a O
smart O
diplomat O
or O
a O
tough O
talker O
? O

I O
think O
a O
tough O
talker O
. O

But O
what O
he O
needs O
to O
learn O
and O
what O
I O
think O
he O
's O
been O
warned O
about O
uh O
from O
diplomats O
up O
there O
is O
that O
you O
need O
votes O
. O

And O
he O
ca O
n't O
go O
in O
with O
a O
mandate O
that O
the O
president O
has O
given O
him O
to O
shake O
the O
place O
up O
with O
some O
of O
those O
pungent O
sound O
bites O
and O
get O
along O
with O
enough O
people O
especially O
because O
his O
own O
credibility O
was O
really O
on O
the O
line O
on O
some O
of O
the O
tough O
issues O
that O
he O
's O
going O
to O
confront O
Iran B-GPE
Iraq B-GPE
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

So O
since O
he O
's O
been O
accused O
of O
twisting O
the O
intelligence O
on O
exactly O
those O
issues O
He O
needs O
some O
allies O
. O

and O
he O
's O
going O
to O
have O
to O
develop O
those O
allies O
now O
. O

He O
will O
have O
the O
Brits B-NORP
and O
some O
of O
the O
other O
traditional O
American B-NORP
allies O
. O

but O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
goodwill O
up O
there O
. O

That O
said O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
has O
experience O
. O

He O
was O
very O
successful O
in O
a O
previous O
incarnation O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
when O
he O
was O
able O
to O
defeat O
the O
Zionism B-NORP
is O
racism O
uh O
resolution O
there O
back O
then O
. O

And O
he O
's O
a O
smart O
guy O
. O

So O
I O
would O
n't O
bet O
against O
him O
. O

What O
about O
the O
the O
European B-NORP
and O
the O
world O
press O
. O

are O
they O
going O
to O
destroy O
him O
before O
he O
gets O
started O
for O
being O
a O
recess O
appointment O
? O

Sure O
but O
Kofi B-PERSON
Annan I-PERSON
look O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
strength O
himself O
especially O
with O
critics O
here O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

So O
while O
he O
would O
like O
to O
warn O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
as O
he O
did O
today B-DATE
that O
there O
are O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
ninety I-CARDINAL
other O
representatives O
the O
US B-GPE
has O
a O
certain O
special O
clout O
. O

and O
Annan B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
to O
listen O
to O
him O
. O

Uh O
I O
guess O
that O
if O
Bolton B-PERSON
had O
not O
said O
some O
of O
the O
things O
that O
he O
had O
said O
in O
the O
past O
that O
you O
know O
the O
UN B-ORG
secretariat O
has O
thirty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
eight I-CARDINAL
floors O
and O
you O
could O
lose O
ten B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
without O
losing O
anything O
those O
kinds O
of O
quotes O
are O
going O
to O
kind O
of O
haunt O
him O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
there O
's O
any O
danger O
in O
the O
world O
of O
causing O
a O
real O
war O
in O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
again O
another B-EVENT
Korean I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
by O
calling O
the O
North B-NORP
Korean I-NORP
dictator O
what O
he O
is O
? O

I O
mean O
he O
calls O
him O
a O
tyrannical O
dictator O
. O

and O
he O
says O
he O
's O
-- O
it O
's O
a O
nightmare O
all O
over O
there O
. O

all O
true O
. O

But O
here O
's O
a O
guy O
on O
Jack B-PRODUCT
Daniels I-PRODUCT
most O
of O
the O
time O
in O
a O
world O
of O
delusion O
. O

Is O
there O
any O
chance O
he O
might O
just O
rattle O
that O
cage O
too O
hard O
? O

Well O
actually O
Condi B-PERSON
Rice I-PERSON
herself O
in O
her O
own O
confirmation O
hearing O
had O
rattled O
that O
cage O
. O

And O
they O
've O
walked O
way O
back O
from O
that O
. O

What O
Rice B-PERSON
is O
proving O
as O
secretary O
is O
that O
she O
's O
much O
more O
pragmatic O
as O
secretary O
of O
state B-ORG
than O
she O
was O
a O
national O
security O
adviser O
on O
Iran B-GPE
and O
on O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
. O

So O
she O
's O
taken O
this O
this O
posture O
she O
's O
reflecting O
the O
president O
's O
view O
as O
adjusted O
for O
second B-ORDINAL
term O
and O
Bolton B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
have O
to O
follow O
that O
line O
. O

He O
ca O
n't O
really O
go O
off O
on O
his O
own O
. O

And O
if O
he O
does O
I O
think O
she O
'll O
reel O
him O
right O
back O
in O
. O

How O
many O
months B-DATE
before O
Condi B-PERSON
Rice I-PERSON
has O
to O
apologize O
or O
defend O
uh O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
his O
language O
? O

Maybe O
two B-CARDINAL
. O

Okay O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
Andrea B-PERSON
Mitchell I-PERSON
. O

Two B-DATE
months I-DATE
it O
is O
. O

I O
'm O
joined O
right O
now O
by O
Steve B-PERSON
McMahon I-PERSON
Democratic B-NORP
political O
strategist O
and O
longtime O
adviser O
to O
Democratic B-ORG
Party I-ORG
Chairman O
Howard B-PERSON
Dean I-PERSON
I O
did O
n't O
know O
he O
's O
been O
around O
that O
long O
and O
Ben B-PERSON
Ginsberg I-PERSON
a O
Republican B-NORP
attorney O
and O
adviser O
to O
the O
conservative O
group O
Progress B-ORG
For I-ORG
America I-ORG
and O
also O
a O
man O
whose O
card O
has O
been O
stamped O
by O
working O
hard O
to O
win O
the O
president O
's O
recount O
in O
Florida B-GPE
right O
? O

Yes O
sir O
. O

Does O
n't O
it O
seem O
to O
you O
that O
people O
like O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
and O
John B-PERSON
Roberts I-PERSON
the O
UN O
-- O
the O
uh O
the O
uh O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
nominee O
have O
all O
earned O
their O
spurs O
through O
this O
sort O
of O
red O
badge O
of O
courage O
down O
in O
the O
Florida B-GPE
recount O
? O

I O
think O
it O
was O
the O
other O
way O
around O
. O

I O
think O
in O
Florida B-GPE
we O
recruited O
the O
best O
and O
the O
brightest O
and O
people O
with O
who O
we O
knew O
would O
be O
excellent O
in O
really O
a O
tough O
and O
historical O
setting O
and O
that O
's O
where O
those O
guys O
came O
in O
. O

Is O
that O
where O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
learned O
how O
to O
be O
so O
belligerent O
down O
there O
in O
uh O
- O

Okay O
let O
me O
ask O
this O
were O
they O
-- O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
a O
tough O
shot O
. O

the O
Democrats B-NORP
who O
voted O
against O
Bolton B-PERSON
and O
denied O
him O
an O
up O
or O
down O
vote O
in O
the O
Senate B-ORG
were O
n't O
they O
just O
in O
a O
certain O
way O
trying O
to O
separate O
themselves O
from O
having O
voted O
for O
the O
war O
? O

This O
is O
their O
chance O
to O
basically O
say O
to O
the O
president O
and O
to O
the O
country O
we O
're O
not O
part O
of O
this O
war O
policy O
of O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
and O
the O
president O
. O

I O
actually O
think O
it O
was O
-- O
it O
was O
their O
chance O
to O
stand O
up O
and O
say O
we O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
somebody O
who O
was O
an O
architect O
of O
a O
war O
, O
who O
was O
an O
architect O
of O
the O
misleading O
information O
that O
we O
got O
and O
that O
the O
world O
got O
. O

many O
of O
the O
world O
uh O
then O
later O
followed O
us O
into O
war O
- O

If O
they O
bought O
it O
back O
before O
why O
are O
they O
not O
buying O
it O
now O
? O

Well O
because O
they O
've O
-- O
they O
've O
learned O
from O
their O
mistake O
. O

I O
mean O
obviously O
you O
know O
when O
you O
-- O
when O
you O
lead O
a O
nation O
and O
a O
world O
into O
war O
um O
and O
you O
are O
-- O
eh O
and O
you O
have O
the O
kind O
of O
record O
that O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
has O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
went O
to O
Florida B-GPE
and O
fought O
in O
the O
recount O
I O
think O
it O
you O
know O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
got O
smart O
. O

Is O
your O
party O
ready O
now O
to O
come O
out O
against O
this O
war O
. O

or O
are O
they O
still O
going O
to O
play O
it O
both O
ways O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
party O
is O
playing O
it O
both O
ways O
. O

I O
think O
our O
party O
is O
going O
to O
hold O
our O
president O
accountable O
. O

Oh O
yes O
they O
are O
. O

support O
the O
troops O
. O

support O
more O
armor O
arm- O
armors O
- O

Eh O
uh O
are O
you O
for O
the O
war O
your O
party O
? O

But O
Chris B-PERSON
you O
can O
be O
against O
the O
war O
and O
and O
be O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
troops O
. O

Uh O
uh O
you O
know O
I O
think O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
pe- O
- O

You O
ca O
n't O
answer O
that O
, O
can O
you O
? O

Well O
no O
our O
party O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
position O
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
people O
- O

Well O
the B-ORG
Republican I-ORG
party I-ORG
has O
a O
position O
. O

Absolutely O
right O
. O

where O
are O
you O
guys O
? O

We- O
well O
of O
course O
the B-ORG
Republican I-ORG
Party I-ORG
has O
a O
position O
. O

The O
president O
tells O
them O
what O
it O
is O
- O

Have O
you O
got O
a O
party O
on O
taxes O
on O
trade O
on O
anything O
? O

I O
ca O
n't O
find O
the O
Democratic B-NORP
position O
on O
any O
issue O
today B-DATE
. O

What O
is O
your O
position O
on O
whether O
we O
should O
roll O
back O
the O
president O
's O
tax O
cut O
? O

Well O
I O
think O
we O
should O
roll O
back O
the O
president O
's O
tax O
cut O
. O

Does O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Party I-ORG
believe O
that O
? O

I O
think O
the O
presiden- O
-- O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Party I-ORG
has O
said O
you O
know O
the O
problem O
is O
- O

The B-ORG
Republican I-ORG
Party I-ORG
is O
for O
the O
tax O
cut O
. O

There O
there O
's O
a O
beauty O
here O
to O
this O
kind O
of O
symmetry O
here O
. O

Well O
absolutely O
. O

The O
Republicans B-NORP
know O
where O
they O
stand O
. O

the O
Democrats B-NORP
they O
are O
still O
looking O
for O
an O
opportunity O
. O

No O
no O
no O
. O

the O
Democrats O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
believe O
that O
the O
president O
has O
driven O
this O
country O
into O
a O
recession O
. O

The O
economy O
is O
is O
on O
the O
wrong O
track O
. O

So O
therefore O
what O
are O
you O
going O
to O
do O
about O
it O
? O

Well O
I O
think O
that O
-- O
I O
think O
most O
Democrats B-NORP
think O
we O
ought O
to O
repeal O
the O
tax O
cuts O
for O
the O
very O
wealthy O
. O

Really O
? O

Yeah O
. O

The O
economy O
is O
taking O
off O
. O

unemployment O
is O
down O
at O
five B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O

you O
've O
had O
sustained O
growth O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

What O
are O
you O
talking O
about O
? O

Okay O
I O
want O
to O
come O
back O
and O
talk O
about O
whether O
we O
have O
a B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
that O
is O
going O
to O
change O
. O

Big O
news O
this B-DATE
weekend I-DATE
. O

Somebody O
says O
that O
they O
think O
that O
this O
guy O
John B-PERSON
Roberts I-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
end O
up O
being O
chief O

within O
six B-DATE

We O

Republican B-NORP

Ben B-PERSON
Ginsberg I-PERSON
and O
Democratic B-NORP
strategist O
Steve B-PERSON
McMahon I-PERSON
. O

Ben B-PERSON
I O
have O
a O
sense O
this O
president O
wants O
this O
guy O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
to O
go O
up O
to O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
. O

He O
's O
already O
up O
there O
. O

He O
's O
been O
booed O
on O
his O
way O
into O
the O
building O
today B-DATE
- O

And O
just O
give O
them O
hell O
. O

Well O
I O
think O
-- O
look O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
is O
a O
principled O
guy O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
skills O
. O

He O
has O
the O
support O
of O
the O
president O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
the O
secretary O
of O
state B-ORG
a O
majority O
of O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
Senate B-ORG
. O

Kofi O
Annan O
says O
he O
's O
going O
to O
work O
with O
him O
. O

The B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
is O
doing O
important O
reform O
work O
. O

And O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
is O
the O
right O
guy O
. O

and O
he O
is O
going O
to O
go O
in O
and O
do O
his O
job O
and O
not O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
carping O
from O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
. O

He O
's O
basically O
going O
to O
waste O
the O
other O
side O
the O
Third B-LOC
World I-LOC
people O
and O
just O
and O
just O
blow O
them O
up O
every B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

No O
absolutely O
not O
. O

that O
's O
not O
his O
mandate O
and O
goal O
. O

His O
mandate O
and O
goal O
is O
to O
fulfill O
the O
foreign O
policy O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

and O
that O
absolutely O
includes O
helping O
the O
people O
of O
the B-LOC
Third I-LOC
World I-LOC
. O

He O
is O
so O
good O
, O
is O
n't O
he O
? O

He O
's O
so O
good O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
like O
sending O
Frank B-PERSON
Rizzo I-PERSON
to O
the O
UN B-ORG
. O

But O
that O
's O
just O
a O
thought O
you O
know O
. O

a O
tough O
customer O
a O
tough O
cop O
or O
else O
how O
about O
hall O
monitor O
. O

Yeah O
exactly O
. O

You O
know O
one O
of O
these O
tough O
guys O
to O
go O
get O
these O
bozos O
in O
line O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
'm O
talking O
from O
the O
the O
subjunctive O
mood O
of O
this O
administration O
. O

Well O
he O
obviously O
thinks O
he O
he O
is O
a O
hall O
monitor O
. O

I O
mean O
you O
you O
know O
the O
president O
may O
refer O
to O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
as O
the O
architect O
. O

but O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
is O
the O
architect O
of O
a O
misleading O
misleading O
the O
country O
misleading O
the O
world O
into O
a O
war O
. O

and O
um O
and O
then O
you O
know O
basically O
during O
his O
confirmation O
hearings O
he O
was O
asked O
whether O
he O
had O
ever O
been O
in- O
interrogated O
as O
part O
of O
an O
investigation O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
tell O
the O
truth O
about O
that O
. O

I O
mean O
this O
is O
an O
administration O
that O
that O
basically O
is O
rewarding O
somebody O
for O
not O
telling O
the O
truth O
consistently O
over O
a O
long O
period O
of O
time O
and O
for O
-- O
and O
for O
belligerently O
abusing O
his O
staff O
. O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
in O
the O
-- O
in O
the O
Senate B-ORG
debate O
. O

Your O
party O
stuck O
by O
what O
you O
just O
said O
about O
blaming O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
for O
the O
war O
. O

In O
fact O
they O
sort O
of O
nickeled O
and O
dimed O
him O
on O
not O
giving O
him O
a O
fair O
up O
or O
down O
vote O
on O
much O
less O
relevant O
points O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
have O
all O
the O
papers O
that O
we O
think O
we O
need O
. O

and O
they O
kept O
playing O
that O
sort O
of O
rope O
a O
dope O
game O
. O

There O
was O
nothing O
about O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
as O
the O
architect O
for O
the O
war O
. O

It O
was O
a O
much O
shriller O
sort O
of O
less O
relevant O
debate O
that O
you O
guys O
did O
. O

Could O
n't O
could O
n't O
the O
strategy O
of O
the O
president O
be O
this O
guy O
is O
going O
to O
be O
his O
lightning O
rod O
? O

They O
'll O
hate O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
. O

they O
wo O
n't O
hat- O
hate O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
. O

Bush B-PERSON
is O
all O
right O
. O

I O
sort O
of O
like O
him O
. O

this O
guy O
Bolton B-PERSON
is O
no O
good O
. O

The O
old O
Bobby O
Kennedy O
you O
know O
Jack B-PERSON
Kennedy I-PERSON
would O
send O
Bobby B-PERSON
out O
there O
. O

Be O
mad O
at O
Bobby B-PERSON
. O

that O
's O
your O
job O
. O

Is O
that O
what O
this O
is O
about O
? O

Not O
Bobb- O
- O

Yeah O
. O

Nobody O
is O
going O
to O
like O
Bolton B-PERSON
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
from I-DATE
now I-DATE
, O
are O
they O
? O

Well O
you O
know O
in O
about O
-- O
in O
about O
-- O
in O
about O
about O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
from I-DATE
now I-DATE
he O
wo O
n't O
-- O
he O
wo O
n't O
either O
. O

He O
's O
not O
going O
to O
get O
reupped O
. O

Is O
there O
any O
chance O
the O
Senate B-ORG
will O
confirm O
him O
? O

Will O
the O
Senate B-ORG
you O
think O
- O

Let O
me O
ask O
you O
a O
question O
. O

Ben B-PERSON
Ginsberg I-PERSON
will O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
Senate B-ORG
eventually O
confirm O
this O
guy O
to O
a O
full O
appointment O
. O

Yeah O
I O
think O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
surprise O
people O
the O
UN B-ORG
- O

Will O
they O
-- O
will O
that O
happen O
? O

Yes O
depending O
on O
the O
election O
results O
. O

Oh O
depending O
on O
- O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O

Well O
the O
he O
is O
-- O
his O
his O
term O
ends O
in O
January B-DATE
of I-DATE
oh I-DATE
seven I-DATE
. O

There O
are O
Senate B-ORG
elections O
in O
November B-DATE
of I-DATE
oh I-DATE
six I-DATE
. O

So O
if O
your O
party O
picks O
up O
seats O
he O
'll O
get O
confirmed O
? O

Yeah O
when O
we O
pick O
up O
the O
five B-CARDINAL
seats O
to O
give O
us O
filibuster O
proof O
. O

It O
will O
be O
easy O
. O

and O
without O
that O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
performance O
will O
do O
it O
. O

What O
a O
standard O
you O
're O
setting O
. O

In O
other O
words O
if O
they O
get O
a O
veto O
uh O
uh O
uh O
what O
do O
you O
call O
it O
a O
fili- O
filibuster O
proof O
majority O
- O

He O
'll O
-- O
he O
will O
-- O
he O
will O
go O
up O
-- O
he O
will O
go O
up O
and O
get O
confirmed O
anyways O
because O
of O
the O
job O
he O
's O
going O
to O
do O
. O

Somebody O
somebody O
said O
on O
one O
of O
the O
weekend B-DATE
shows O
I O
think O
they O
're O
right O
if O
it O
were O
a O
secret O
vote O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
would O
n't O
carry O
the O
Republican B-NORP
caucus O
. O

and O
I O
think O
that O
's O
absolutely O
right O
. O

And O
if O
it O
were O
an O
up O
or O
down O
vote O
he O
would O
have O
been O
confirmed O
because O
he O
had O
a O
majority O
of O
support O
in O
the O
Senate B-ORG
. O

Do O
you O
think O
he O
would O
carry O
the O
Republican B-NORP
caucus O
vote O
? O

Yes O
he O
had O
a O
majority O
-- O
he O
had O
a O
majority O
of O
support O
on O
the O
cloture O
petitions O
. O

it O
was O
n't O
enough O
to O
get O
sixty B-CARDINAL
. O

Are O
we O
going O
anywhere O
in O
this O
uh O
CIA B-ORG
investigation O
? O

Here O
's O
the O
question O
I O
ask O
you O
. O

Will O
this O
end O
up O
in O
a O
simple O
report O
from O
uh O
from O
Patrick B-PERSON
Fitzgerald I-PERSON
the O
investigator O
the O
prosecutor O
from O
Chicago B-GPE
. O

or O
will O
he O
end O
up O
with O
some O
really O
serious O
indictments O
Ben B-PERSON
Ginsberg I-PERSON
? O

I O
think O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
. O

but O
no O
it O
does O
n't O
appear O
like O
right O
now O
that O
there O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
uh O
indictments O
certainly O
on O
the O
leak O
. O

but O
there O
is O
it O
seems O
a O
lot O
going O
on O
beneath O
the O
surface O
and O
certainly O
a O
lot O
of O
speculation O
uh O
going O
on O
in O
Washington B-GPE
. O

So O
you O
're O
not O
-- O
you O
're O
betting O
against O
perjury O
indictments O
? O

I O
would O
-- O
I O
I O
would O
-- O
I O
would O
suspect O
no O
. O

Obstruction O
of O
justice O
indictments O
. O

But O
as O
I O
say O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
going O
on O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
perjury O
or O
obstruction O
if O
there O
are O
indictments O
at O
all O
. O

I O
I O
I O
think O
it O
's O
pretty O
difficult O
to O
have O
an O
investigation O
of O
this O
length O
at O
this O
cost O
to O
put O
a O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
uh O
reporter O
in O
jail O
for O
this O
length O
of O
time O
. O

Steve B-PERSON
did O
n't O
they O
work O
for O
the O
secretary O
of O
agriculture O
for O
years B-DATE
and O
go O
for O
like B-DATE
three I-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

and O
they O
never O
got O
anything O
on O
the O
guy O
? O

. O

Well O
this O
investigation O
they O
never O
put O
a O
reporter O
in O
jail O
-- O
they O
never O
put O
a O
reporter O
in O
jail O
for O
something O
. O

In O
fact O
it O
's O
never O
happened O
before O
. O

. O

They O
got O
him O
with O
the O
basketball O
tickets O
. O

But O
she O
's O
not O
talking O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
witness O
. O

Well O
they O
've O
got O
plenty O
of O
witnesses O
. O

and O
they O
have O
got O
plenty O
-- O
they O
have O
got O
plenty O
of O
ammunition O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
charge- O
- O

Steve B-PERSON
what O
's O
the O
charge O
going O
to O
be O
? O

I O
think O
-- O
I O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
see O
perjury O
or O
obstruction O
of O
justice O
because O
I O
I O
frankly O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
on O
a O
-- O
on O
a O
technical O
specific O
intent O
crime O
like O
the O
one O
that O
was O
originally O
alleged O
they O
're O
going O
to O
-- O
they O
're O
going O
to O
probably O
return O
an O
indictment O
because O
it O
's O
a O
specific O
intent O
crime O
. O

But O
on O
obstruction O
and O
on O
perjury O
it O
looks O
like O
there O
's O
plenty O
of O
room O
. O

Joe B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
says O
that O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
will O
be O
frog O
- O
walked O
out O
of O
the B-FAC
White I-FAC
House I-FAC
. O

uh O
uh O
he O
means O
in O
chains O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
that O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
? O

I O
I O
think O
that O
's O
unlikely O
. O

Unlikely O
. O

This O
investigation O
got O
so O
much O
scrutiny O
from O
the O
media O
when O
it O
started O
that O
if O
you O
were O
going O
to O
do O
a O
no O
prosecution O
in O
this O
case O
you O
would O
have O
to O
ask O
a O
huge O
number O
of O
questions O
just O
as O
the O
prosecutor O
is O
doing O
to O
be O
able O
to O
come O
up O
with O
that O
no O
prosecution O
. O

You O
know O
what O
I O
think O
? O

By O
the O
way O
- O

I O
think O
they O
've O
got O
a O
huge O
paper O
trail O
. O

They O
've O
been O
interviewing O
people O
interrogating O
them O
before O
a O
grand O
jury O
for O
months B-DATE
. O

They O
have O
so O
many O
potential O
contradictions O
. O

And O
having O
watched O
what O
this O
fellow O
Pet- O
uh O
Patrick B-PERSON
Fitzgerald I-PERSON
did O
in O
Chicago B-GPE
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
ago I-DATE
with O
the O
adm- O
Daley B-PERSON
administration O
where O
he O
took O
down O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
top O
guys O
on O
patronage O
which O
most O
people O
would O
say O
is O
n't O
that O
what O
they O
do O
out O
there O
in O
Chicago B-GPE
, O
I O
think O
he O
's O
serious O
business O
. O

I O
would O
look O
out O
for O
this O
guy O
if O
I O
were O
in O
the O
-- O
in O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
staff O
. O

Yeah O
and O
by O
the O
way O
I O
was O
-- O
I O
was O
commenting O
on O
the O
frog O
- O
walk O
. O

I O
think O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
may O
have O
a O
real O
problem O
on O
his O
hands O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
he O
'll O
be O
frog O
- O
walked O
. O

I O
think O
if O
there O
's O
any O
way O
the O
president O
can O
stand O
by O
his O
man O
he O
will O
but O
it O
's O
going O
to O
get O
maybe O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
difficult O
for O
him O
to O
do O
that O
. O

Is O
anybody O
going O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
staff O
who O
has O
been O
indicted O
Ben B-PERSON
? O

Once O
indicted O
. O

I O
think O
once O
you O
're O
indicted O
it O
's O
difficult O
to O
keep O
anyone O
on O
a O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
staff O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
the O
big O
second B-ORDINAL
term O
booboo O
of O
this O
administration O
? O

Like O
they O
always O
seem O
to O
have O
one B-CARDINAL
. O

this O
president O
has O
n't O
suffered O
one B-CARDINAL
yet O
. O

Iran B-EVENT
- I-EVENT
Contra I-EVENT
Watergate B-EVENT
Monica B-PERSON
they O
all O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
problem O
. O

uh O
ba- O
uh O
you O
know O
Sherman B-PERSON
Adams I-PERSON
with O
Eisenhower B-PERSON
the O
court O
packing O
by O
FDR B-PERSON
. O

It O
's O
almost O
automatic O
this O
second B-ORDINAL
term O
problem O
. O

And O
if O
-- O
and O
if O
you O
look O
at O
the O
way O
they O
've O
handled O
this O
publicly O
ba- O
basically O
if O
they O
handled O
it O
within O
the O
grand O
jury O
the O
same O
way O
they O
handled O
it O
publicly O
by O
dissembling O
and O
misleading O
and O
in O
some O
cases O
maybe O
ou- O
outright O
misrepresentation O
of O
the O
truth O
it O
it O
it O
it O
seems O
pretty O
likely O
that O
it O
's O
going O
to O
lead O
to O
some O
criminal O
activity O
because O
this O
guy O
is O
there O
to O
do O
a O
job O
and O
he O
's O
not O
a O
partisan O
but O
he O
's O
a O
very O
tough O
prosecutor O
. O

In O
fact O
he O
was O
originally O
uh O
an O
appointee O
of O
the O
president O
's O
father O
. O

So O
this O
is O
not O
a O
Democratic B-NORP
witch O
hunt O
. O

it O
's O
a O
very O
serious O
matter O
. O

and O
I O
think O
you O
know O
these O
guys O
may O
have O
some O
problems O
on O
their O
hand O
. O

Ben B-PERSON
do O
you O
think O
. O

a O
lot O
of O
fights O
that O
have O
been O
going O
on O
last B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
days I-DATE
whether O
it O
's O
the O
j- O
nomination O
to O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
of O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
the O
issue O
of O
the O
-- O
of O
the O
the O
leak O
investigation O
if O
you O
write O
the O
history O
now O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
from I-DATE
now I-DATE
, O
what O
the O
real O
fight O
is O
about O
is O
the O
recriminations O
over O
whether O
we O
should O
have O
gone O
to O
war O
. O

and O
that O
is O
what O
the O
fight O
is O
about O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
I O
agree O
with O
that O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
the O
overlook O
story O
is O
the O
real O
accomplishments O
of O
the O
Congress B-ORG
bipartisan O
uh O
on O
Friday B-DATE
and O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

Yeah O
. O

You O
had O
energy O
. O

you O
had O
transportation O
. O

uh O
you O
've O
had O
tort O
reform O
. O

you O
've O
had O
bankruptcy O
bills O
. O

you O
got O
an O
economy O
that O
's O
going O
along O
uh O
pretty O
well O
. O

This O
has O
been O
an O
aura O
of O
-- O
an O
era O
of O
achievement O
for O
the O
president O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
be O
going O
back O
looking O
at O
this B-DATE
period I-DATE
in I-DATE
time I-DATE
uh O
in O
that O
-- O
in O
that O
lens O
yeah O
. O

As O
fail O
period O
. O

Uh O
I O
I O
think O
the O
story O
of O
this O
administration O
especially O
this O
this O
second B-ORDINAL
term O
is O
arrogance O
and O
abuse O
of O
power O
. O

I O
mean O
basically O
anybody O
who O
gets O
in O
their O
way O
they O
knock O
down O
. O

As O
bad O
as O
FDR B-PERSON
in O
the O
second O
term O
? O

Worse O
worse O
Chris B-PERSON
way O
- O

As O
Clinton B-PERSON
during O
Lewinsky B-PERSON
? O

Well O
you O
know O
uh O
we O
've O
learned O
that O
perjury O
is O
a O
problem O
for O
public O
officials O
. O

and O
we O
learned O
it O
from O
so- O
a O
matter O
as O
unusual O
as O
Clinton B-PERSON
and O
Monica B-PERSON
. O

But O
in O
fact O
Ben B-PERSON
I O
think O
I O
sat O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
shows O
with O
you O
talking O
about O
that O
very O
subject O
. O

and O
you O
had O
a O
differen- O
-- O
you O
were O
singing O
a O
different O
tune O
then O
, O
were O
n't O
you O
? O

Okay O
we O
learned O
a O
lot O
tonight B-TIME
. O

You O
say O
John B-PERSON
Bolton I-PERSON
will O
be O
confirmed O
by O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
Senate B-ORG
within O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
? O

Yes O
. O

Well O
no O
in O
the O
end O
at O
the O
end O
when O
his O
term O
is O
up O
. O

You O
believe O
he O
will O
not O
be O
? O

In O
early O
early B-DATE
two I-DATE
thousand I-DATE
seven I-DATE
because O
the O
Senate B-ORG
will O
be O
packed O
with O
Republicans B-NORP
by O
then O
. O

No O
because O
he O
's O
going O
to O
do O
such O
a O
good O
job O
he O
's O
going O
to O
deserve O
- O

Absolutely O
. O

And O
you O
believe O
there O
will O
be O
indictments O
coming O
out O
of O
this O
investigation O
of O
the O
CIA B-ORG
leak O
? O

Uh O
I O
think O
it O
's O
more O
likely O
than O
not O
yeah O
. O

You O
think O
there O
wo O
n't O
be O
? O

I O
think O
that O
there O
wo O
n't O
be O
of O
White B-ORG
House I-ORG
staff O
. O

Okay O
thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O

I O
think O
the O
differences O
of O
opinion O
here O
- O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
Ben B-PERSON
Ginsberg I-PERSON
Republican B-NORP
strategist O
Steve B-PERSON

Democratic B-NORP
strategist O
he O
said O
breathlessly O
. O

Uh O
next O
a O
delegation O
of O
conservative O
radio O
this O
is O
so O
hot O
radio O
talk O
show O
hosts O
from O
around O
the O
country O
went O
to O
Iraq B-GPE
to O
oppose O
what O
they O
call O
the O
liberal O
media O
bias O
against O
that O
war O
. O

What O
's O
really O
going O
on O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
? O

We O
're O
going O
to O
hear O
from O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
start O
with O
Melanie B-PERSON
just O
back O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
ago I-DATE
what O
did O
you O
smell O
over O
there O
? O

What O
did O
you O
see O
? O

Well O
first O
of O
all O
it O
was O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
and I-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
degrees I-QUANTITY
in O
the O
shade O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Um O
and O
when O
you O
're O
wearing O
like O
I O
was O
twenty B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
pounds I-QUANTITY
of O
body O
armor O
um O
and O
sweating O
through O
your O
clothes O
and O
trying O
to O
stay O
hydrated O
um O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
sandstorm O
um O
where O
we O
were O
trapped O
on O
a O
couple O
of O
different O
occasions O
it O
was O
pretty O
grueling O
tough O
work O
and O
an O
assignment O
that O
made O
me O
have O
a O
tremendous O
appreciation O
of O
what O
our O
troops O
are O
going O
through O
on O
a O
day O
to O
day O
basis O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

What O
did O
you O
-- O
what O
did O
you O
get O
from O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
? O

Do O
they O
like O
us O
. O

Do O
they O
dislike O
us O
. O

Are O
they O
neutral O
? O

Are O
they O
waiting O
to O
see O
who O
wins O
or O
what O
? O

I O
think O
that O
many O
of O
of O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
at O
least O
the O
ones O
with O
whom O
I O
spoke O
felt O
very O
strongly O
that O
they O
appreciated O
the O
American B-NORP
presence O
there O
. O

They O
are O
obviously O
extremely O
concerned O
about O
the O
level O
of O
violence O
that O
is O
is O
coming O
from O
the O
insurgency O
. O

but O
there O
's O
a O
reason O
for O
it O
. O

and O
you O
have O
n't O
heard O
this O
discussed O
in O
the O
mainstream O
media O
because O
nobody O
has O
brought O
it O
up O
. O

The O
reason O
why O
they O
are O
concerned O
is O
because O
they O
know O
that O
the O
upcoming O
August O
and O
December O
referential O
-- O
uh O
the O
constitutional O
referendum O
is O
terribly O
important O
. O

the O
insurgency O
made O
a O
strategic O
and O
tactical O
error O
by O
not O
disrupting O
the O
last O
election O
back O
in O
January B-DATE
. O

They O
know O
that O
it O
's O
coming O
time O
around O
. O

But O
if O
those O
elections O
go O
successfully O
as O
the O
American B-NORP
military O
is O
hoping O
and O
planning O
for O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
army O
then O
they O
're O
-- O
we O
are O
going O
to O
start O
discussing O
the O
possibility O
of O
drawing O
down O
down O
our O
troops O
. O

And O
that O
's O
something O
that O
I O
learned O
and O
reported O
on O
while O
I O
was O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

And O
it O
was O
n't O
until O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
later I-DATE
I O
finally O
started O
seeing O
something O
in O
the O
front O
pages O
of O
the O
daily O
newspapers O
. O

Paul B-PERSON
you O
helped O
fight O
that O
war O
. O

your O
reaction O
to O
what O
Melanie B-PERSON
just O
said O
? O

Well O
I O
think O
it O
's O
great O
that O
some O
reporters O
are O
headed O
over O
there O
and O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
taste O
and O
a O
feel O
for O
what O
soldiers O
like O
me O
lived O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

And O
I O
was O
there O
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
in O
Central B-LOC
Baghdad I-LOC
. O

And O
I O
saw O
the O
good O
the O
bad O
and O
everything O
in O
between O
. O

And O
I O
think O
reporters O
need O
to O
really O
continue O
to O
go O
outside O
their O
area O
of O
comfortability O
outside O
the B-LOC
Green I-LOC
Zone I-LOC
. O

But O
I O
think O
the O
reality O
is O
that O
Ms. O
Morgan B-PERSON
like O
most O
reporters O
are O
really O
spoon O
- O
fed O
uh O
their O
experience O
there O
. O

They O
're O
prada- O
-- O
they O
're O
provided O
with O
with O
DOD B-ORG
contractors O
or O
uh O
military O
security O
personnel O
. O

and O
what O
they O
get O
is O
a O
very O
narrow O
understanding O
of O
what O
the O
day O
to O
day O
life O
is O
. O

Not O
enough O
reporters O
are O
really O
going O
outside O
of O
that O
comfortability O
factor O
and O
going O
beyond O
that O
to O
try O
to O
experience O
what O
we O
as O
soliders O
experience O
. O

What O
makes O
-- O
wha- O
what O
what O
makes O
you O
assume O
that O
I O
stayed O
inside O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
? O

That O
's O
another O
thing O
that O
you O
've O
written O
about O
me O
that O
is O
a O
lie O
. O

That O
's O
not O
what O
I O
said O
ma'am O
. O

What O
I O
said O
was O
that O
you O
did O
n't O
get O
out O
of O
your O
comfortbility O
zone O
. O

What O
you O
- O

If O
I O
could O
finish O
I O
'll O
respond O
. O

I O
think O
that O
you O
were O
there O
for O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

And O
I O
think O
you O
got O
your O
feet O
wet O
. O

and O
that O
's O
nice O
. O

But O
then O
you O
back O
to O
your O
comfortable O
house O
in O
the O
civilian O
world O
. O

and O
the O
soliders O
stayed O
there O
. O

Excuse O
me O
Paul B-PERSON
. O

I O
think O
if O
you O
really O
wanted O
a O
taste O
of O
that O
experience O
you O
could O
spend O
more O
time O
there O
. O

Excuse O
me O
Paul B-PERSON
. O

I O
have O
spent O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
as O
as O
a O
correspondant O
. O

I O
was O
in O
Bejing B-GPE
when O
when O
college O
students O
were O
being O
murdered O
. O

I O
covered O
their O
dead O
bodies O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Beirut B-GPE
in O
nineteen B-DATE
eighty I-DATE
three I-DATE
. O

I O
've O
seen O
the O
dead O
and O
and O
and O
American B-NORP
wounded O
. O

I O
have O
ha- O
had O
a O
long O
and O
extensive O
career O
. O

So O
please O
do O
n't O
lecture O
me O
about O
my O
comfortability O
zone O
. O

Let O
me O
go O
-- O
let O
me O
go O
to O
Melanie B-PERSON
. O

Melanie B-PERSON
I O
want O
to O
get O
some O
reporting O
here O
an O
opportunity O
to O
report O
. O

When O
you O
talked O
to O
regular O
Iraqis B-NORP
what O
were O
they O
telling O
you O
? O

Did O
you O
get O
a O
sense O
- O

I O
know O
you O
could O
n't O
take O
a O
poll O
in O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

but O
what O
were O
they O
saying O
about O
our O
presence O
? O

Many O
of O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
were O
fearful O
because O
of O
the O
extraordinary O
level O
of O
IED O
improvised O
explosive O
devices O
that O
were O
going O
off O
and O
killing O
people O
. O

But O
here O
's O
the O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
. O

The B-DATE
day I-DATE
that O
I O
was O
there O
there O
were O
-- O
uh O
there O
were O
thirty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
young O
school O
children O
who O
were O
killed O
about B-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
blocks O
away O
from O
where O
I O
was O
located O
because O
an O
American B-NORP
soldier O
had O
the O
audacity O
to O
hand O
them O
candy O
because O
we O
were O
at O
the O
same O
time O
passing O
out O
soccer O
balls O
um O
at O
orphanages O
. O

We O
we O
talked O
to O
these O
people O
. O

They O
are O
grateful O
because O
we O
are O
feeding O
and O
helping O
to O
train O
these O
people O
to O
take O
over O
the O
responsibility O
for O
their O
government O
. O

and O
it O
's O
a O
responsibility O
Chris B-PERSON
that O
they O
are O
very O
eager O
to O
assume O
. O

Do O
you O
believe O
this O
is O
to O
me O
- O

I O
'm O
not O
over O
there O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
been O
over O
there O
. O

The O
question O
I O
want O
to O
know O
is O
who O
is O
going O
to O
win O
this O
war O
based O
on O
fighting O
zeal O
? O

We O
saw O
for O
years O
as O
you O
described O
and O
everybody O
else O
knows O
for O
years B-DATE
the O
minority O
in O
that O
country O
were O
the O
bullies O
of O
that O
country O
. O

They O
ran O
it O
because O
they O
were O
good O
smart O
vicious O
bullies O
. O

How O
do O
we O
know O
that O
those O
bullies O
wo O
n't O
eventually O
grab O
control O
again O
the B-TIME
minute I-TIME
we O
leave O
Melanie B-PERSON
? O

We O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
uh O
uh O
uh O
a O
psychic O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
read O
the O
future O
. O

But O
what O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
is O
that O
when O
I O
talked O
to O
er O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
general O
in O
charge O
of O
training O
troops O
over O
there O
he O
was O
telling O
us O
some O
very O
good O
news O
. O

There O
are O
sixty B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
troop O
strength O
now O
. O

um O
in O
in O
terms O
of O
where O
they O
are O
are O
trying O
to O
attain O
a O
goal O
of O
a B-PERCENT
hundred I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
readiness O
they O
're O
at O
sixty B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O

Um O
they O
're O
making O
progress O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

and O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
matter O
is O
is O
the O
Iraqis O
keep O
-- O
no O
matter O
how O
many O
times O
they O
are O
killed O
and O
blown O
up O
um O
by O
the O
insurgents O
, O
they O
come O
back O
and O
they O
-- O
and O
and O
more O
people O
-- O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
as O
many O
people O
joined O
that O
line O
at O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
police O
recruiting O
station O
after O
the O
previous O
bomb O
explosion O
because O
they O
want O
to O
be O
invested O
in O
this O
country O
in O
their O
country O
. O

You O
can O
not O
-- O
you O
can O
not O
breathe O
democracy O
at O
this O
without O
-- O
at O
these O
people O
without O
them O
breathing O
it O
in O
inhaling O
it O
and O
enjoying O
and O
wanting O
it O
even O
more O
badly O
. O

The O
same O
question O
to O
you O
Paul B-PERSON
. O

You O
know O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
World B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
Two I-EVENT
the O
worst O
thing O
that O
happened O
uh O
in O
the O
century O
uh O
the O
uh O
the O
French B-NORP
army O
was O
bigger O
and O
more O
impressive O
than O
the O
German B-NORP
army O
. O

but O
the O
German B-NORP
army O
wanted O
to O
kill O
. O

It O
wanted O
to O
take O
land O
. O

it O
had O
revenge O
in O
its O
heart O
. O

It O
had O
that O
ferocity O
of O
the O
fighter O
. O

the O
French B-NORP
did O
not O
. O

They O
wanted O
the O
thing O
over O
with O
. O

they O
wanted O
the O
phony O
war O
to O
continue O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
Shia B-NORP
who O
are O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
new O
government O
have O
that O
fighting O
hatred O
or O
whatever O
you O
want O
to O
call O
it O
the O
zeal O
to O
defeat O
bullies O
this O
time O
. O

or O
are O
we O
going O
to O
lose O
this O
fight O
? O

. O

You O
know O
I O
think O
that O
's O
the O
bigger O
question O
. O

And O
the O
bigger O
question O
is O
are O
we O
winning O
or O
are O
we O
losing O
? O

Are O
we O
making O
more O
than O
we O
're O
killing O
? O

And O
I O
think O
that O
's O
the O
real O
question O
we O
have O
to O
answer O
. O

And O
day O
to O
day O
what O
I O
saw O
was O
that O
we O
were O
in O
the O
macro-perspective O
making O
more O
enemies O
than O
we O
're O
killing O
. O

and O
this O
goes O
beyond O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

How O
are O
we O
doing O
that O
? O

What O
did O
you O
see O
? O

By O
by O
our O
occupation O
and O
also O
by O
our O
bullying O
tactics O
by O
our O
failure O
to O
offer O
economic O
solutions O
and O
diplomatic O
solutions O
our O
failure O
to O
have O
enough O
interpreters O
on O
the O
ground O
our O
failure O
to O
provide O
a O
secure O
situation O
. O

we O
've O
never O
had O
enough O
troops O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

And O
when O
I O
got O
to O
Baghdad B-GPE
at O
the O
outset O
we O
could O
n't O
provide O
overwhelming O
force O
to O
establish O
security O
. O

And O
we O
've O
been O
playing O
catchup O
*ever O
ever O
since O
. O

Should O
we O
have O
gone O
in O
not O
gone O
in O
or O
gone O
in O
with O
greater O
strength O
? O

Of O
those O
three B-CARDINAL
options O
what O
are O
you O
more O
comfortable O
with O
? O

Go O
in O
not O
go O
in O
or O
go O
in O
with O
greater O
strength O
. O

Ah O
as O
a O
solider O
it O
was O
not O
up O
to O
me O
whether O
or O
not O
we O
went O
in O
. O

But O
it O
is O
now O
you O
're O
a O
citizen O
. O

What O
should O
we O
have O
done O
? O

I O
went O
in O
. O

I O
w- O
- O

Right O
. O

I O
think O
when O
we O
went O
in O
there O
and O
when O
we O
committed O
to O
doing O
it O
we O
should O
have O
done O
it O
the O
right O
way O
. O

and O
Colin B-PERSON
Powell I-PERSON
called O
for O
overwhelming O
force O
. O

General O
Shinseki B-PERSON
said O
we O
needed O
several B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
of O
troops O
on O
the O
ground O
. O

and O
what O
we O
really O
need O
from O
the O
*journalistic O
journalistic O
community O
and O
the O
administration O
is O
honest O
candor O
about O
where O
are O
we O
now O
and O
how O
long O
are O
we O
going O
to O
be O
there O
? O

And O
I O
think O
when O
Ms. O
Morgan B-PERSON
she O
goes O
over O
there O
and O
cheerleads O
and O
really O
does O
n't O
provide O
an O
accurate O
analysis O
of O
the O
long O
term O
obstacles O
that O
we O
're O
up O
against O
it O
's O
disingenuous O
. O

Okay O
if O
you O
're O
president O
last O
question O
Paul B-PERSON
should O
we O
send O
more O
troops O
over O
there O
or O
bring O
them O
all O
back O
? O

What O
should O
we O
do O
? O

It O
it O
depends O
on O
what O
you O
want O
to O
achieve O
. O

Well O
what O
do O
you O
want O
to O
achieve O
? O

But O
I O
think O
-- O
I O
think O
if O

More O

And O
I O
think O
that O

a O
political O

That O
is O
the O

and O
we O

that O
from O

and O
that O

We O

Melanie B-PERSON
how O
do O
we O
get O
the O
straight O
scoop O
on O
what O
's O
happening O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
because O
people O
tell O
me O
there O
's O
only O
two B-CARDINAL
ways O
to O
go O
over O
there O
as O
a O
journalist O
I O
think O
your O
experience O
confirms O
this O
you O
either O
go O
over O
there O
and O
stay O
in O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
or O
that O
that O
part O
of O
uh O
uh O
which O
is O
very O
secure O
and O
it O
's O
basically O
a O
compound O
or O
you O
go O
out O
with O
a O
unit O
as O
an O
embedded O
-- O
uh O
basically O
part O
of O
the O
unit O
an O
embedded O
reporter O
. O

You O
never O
really O
get O
to O
mix O
with O
the O
locals O
. O

Uh O
how O
do O
you O
do O
it O
to O
find O
out O
whether O
they O
're O
-- O
we O
're O
actually O
winning O
the O
uh O
war O
over O
there O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
exactly O
what O
I O
did O
. O

I O
went O
out O
um O
and O
visited O
with O
the O
troops O
. O

and O
I O
went O
outside O
of O
the B-LOC
green I-LOC
zone I-LOC
unlike O
uh O
Mr. O
Rieckhoff B-PERSON
has O
accused O
me O
of O
doing O
. O

But O
do O
you O
-- O
outside O
that O
how O
do O
you O
get O
out O
there O
with O
the O
people O
? O

Well O
because O
you O
get O
out O
there O
with O
the O
troops O
. O

They O
take O
you O
in O
in O
Humvees B-PRODUCT
and O
in O
up- O
armored O
- O

Then O
you O
get O
out O
of O
the O
Humvees B-PRODUCT
. O

and O
and O
you O
hand O
out O
soccer O
balls O
. O

and O
you O
go O
to O
orphanages O
. O

and O
and O
you O
talk O
uh O
and O
hold O
hold O
babies O
and O
talk O
with O
the O
people O
who O
are O
taking O
care O
of O
them O
. O

All O
of O
these O
things O
that O
fourteen B-CARDINAL
members O
of O
our O
entourage O
did O
- O

But O
do O
speak O
of O
do O
people O
speak O
freely O
-- O

let O

Chris B-PERSON
Chris B-PERSON
- O

No O
. O

Chris B-PERSON
uh O
let O
me O
just O
say O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
. O

Before O
Mr. O
m- O
m- O
-- O
Mr. O
Rieckhoff B-PERSON
has O
written O
um O
that O
our O
group O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
bigots O
idiots O
and O
propagandists O
. O

and O
that O
's O
before O
he O
even O
cracked O
a O
sweat O
. O

Now O
I O
want O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
there O
is O
something O
very O
important O
a O
message O
that O
is O
very O
important O
that O
I O
wanted O
to O
articulate O
here O
. O

Our O
men O
and O
women O
are O
living O
and O
dying O
in O
ghastly O
conditions O
. O

Uh O
it O
's O
hot O
a B-QUANTITY
hundred I-QUANTITY
and I-QUANTITY
twenty I-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
degrees I-QUANTITY
. O

They O
are O
making O
peace O
in O
in O
in O
sandstorms O
. O

They O
are O
doing O
their O
dead O
level O
best O
to O
make O
this O
policy O
that O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
has O
put O
forth O
work O
. O

I O
think O
that O
as O
an O
American B-NORP
people O
the O
stories O
that O
I O
tell O
from O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
that O
our O
fellow O
talk O
show O
hosts O
told O
um O
eh O
uh O
hopefully O
will O
engender O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
patience O
and O
endurance O
by O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
. O

I O
think O
we O
owe O
our O
troops O
that O
. O

Let O
me O
ask O
you O
the O
same O
question O
Paul B-PERSON
. O

How O
do O
you O
get O
the O
the O
true O
scoop O
over O
there O
if O
you O
're O
always O
with O
the O
American B-NORP
troops O
? O

I O
mean O
do O
you O
ever O
get O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
? O

Maybe O
it O
's O
just O
a O
catch O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
. O

they O
're O
too O
dangerous O
to O
deal O
with O
. O

But O
how O
do O
you O
get O
the O
story O
? O

The O
the O
reality O
is O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

And O
I O
think O
Ms. O
Morgan B-PERSON
is O
really O
insulting O
all O
the O
troops O
who O
've O
been O
there O
to O
assume O
that O
by O
going O
for O
ten B-DATE
days I-DATE
and O
taking O
a O
few O
casual O
leisurely O
trips O
outside O
the B-LOC
Green I-LOC
Zone I-LOC
that O
she O
got O
a O
full O
taste O
of O
combat O
. O

I O
think O
the O
reality O
is O
much O
different O
. O

And O
if O
reporters O
really O
want O
to O
do O
some O
investigative O
reporting O
they O
can O
fly O
into O
Jordan B-GPE
and O
go O
unembedded O
. O

Now O
there O
is O
a O
chance O
they O
might O
get O
their O
head O
cut O
off O
. O

But O
that O
's O
the O
reality O
that O
we O
face O
as O
soldiers O
every B-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

I O
think O
really O
the O
best O
way O
to O
do O
it O
is O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
troops O
coming O
home O
. O

We O
're O
ready O
. O

we O
're O
-- O
we O
're O
willing O
and O
able O
to O
come O
on O
your O
program O
and O
others O
and O
talk O
about O
our O
experiences O
and O
really O
try O
to O
educate O
the O
public O
about O
the O
reality O
of O
all O
sides O
of O
this O
conflict O
. O

Well O
guess O
what O
. O

that O
's O
exactly O
what O
we O
did O
. O

We O
stuck O
a O
microphone O
in O
front O
of O
all O
of O
the O
troops O
. O

Ma'am O
you O
did O
it O
with O
-- O
you O
did O
- O

We O
stuck O
a O
microphone O
and O
let O
them O
-- O
let O
them O
talk O
directly O
to O
the O
people O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

You O
did O
it O
while O
they O
were O
on O
active O
duty O
. O

Ma'am O
you O
did O
while O
they O
were O
on O
active O
duty O
. O

Unfiltered O
by O
the O
main O
stream O
media O
that O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
guts O
- O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
yell O
over O
me O
the O
entire O
show O
? O

I O
'm O
-- O
I O
'm O
trying O
to O
respond O
to O
- O

Okay O
her O
turn O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

Melanie B-PERSON
your O
turn O
. O

Take O
a O
minute O
Melanie B-PERSON
. O

Melanie B-PERSON
make O
your O
point O
. O

I O
'm O
sorry O
. O

No O
interruptions O
please O
Paul B-PERSON
. O

give O
her O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
. O

What O
I O
want O
to O
say O
is O
that O
we O
took O
our O
microphones O
to O
the O
US B-GPE
troops O
. O

and O
if O
you O
think O
that O
what O
we O
heard O
from O
them O
are O
lies O
then O
you O
are O
accusing O
the O
troops O
of O
being O
liars O
because O
we O
did O
not O
filter O
or O
editorialize O
or O
in O
any O
way O
try O
to O
massage O
their O
message O
. O

They O
gave O
us O
the O
story O
as O
they O
see O
it O
. O

and O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
believe O
it O
then O
you O
are O
doing O
a O
disservice O
to O
your O
fellow O
troops O
. O

Ma'am O
uh O
uh O
go O
ahead O
. O

Oh O
let O
me O
go O
Paul B-PERSON
before O
you O
start O
. O

What O
I O
keep O
doing O
here O
is O
asking O
people O
on O
and O
off O
camera O
who O
come O
on O
this O
program O
high O
- O
ranking O
officers O
enlisted O
uh O
former O
officers O
. O

Uh O
I O
get O
sometimes O
not O
all O
the O
time O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
versions O
the O
version O
they O
give O
me O
on O
the O
air O
and O
the O
version O
they O
give O
me O
the B-TIME
minute I-TIME
when O
we O
're O
off O
the O
air O
. O

The O
version O
they O
give O
me O
when O
we O
're O
on O
the O
air O
is O
gung O
ho O
we O
're O
doing O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
everything O
is O
moving O
along O
. O

The O
version O
they O
give O
me O
off O
the O
air O
is O
Rumsfeld B-PERSON
is O
crazy O
there O
are O
n't O
enough O
troops O
over O
there O
we O
're O
not O
taking O
this O
seriously O
enough O
or O
we O
should O
n't O
be O
there O
sometimes O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
always O
a O
straight O
scoop O
- O

. O

when O
you O
go O
on O
televsion O
with O
people O
because O
they O
want O
to O
be O
loyal O
to O
their O
units O
and O
their O
their O
service O
. O

That O
's O
exactly O
right O
. O

And O
Chris B-PERSON
I O
'm O
no O
-- O
I O
'm O
-- O
There O
's O
no O
one O
more O
loyal O
to O
the O
troops O
than O
I O
am O
. O

I O
am O
still O
in O
the O

. O

There O
's O
a O
likelihood O
that O
I O
'll O
go O
back O
while O
Ms. O
Morgan B-PERSON
is O
back O
at O
her O
radio O
show O
. O

So O
what O
I O
really O
want O
to O
do O
is O
educate O
the O
public O
about O
the O
truth O
of O
what O
's O
happening O
there O
. O

And O
I O
think O
the O
reality O
is O
that O
when O
people O
like O
her O
go O
over O
there O
there O
's O
a O
public O
affairs O
officer O
standing O
right O
next O
to O
that O
young O
soldier O
. O

And O
he O
's O
on O
active O
duty O
. O

and O
he O
wants O
to O
support O
the O
cause O
. O

And O
he O
ca O
n't O
speak O
freely O
. O

That O
's O
a O
fact O
. O

A O
young O
blogger O
was O
just O
reprimanded O
last B-DATE

because O
he O
was O
a O

when O
I O

when O
they O
come O

now O
in O

new O

The O

the O

indeed O
the O

the O

he O
hopes O
in O

to O
get O

touch O

his O
soul O

his O
individual O
soul O

as O
opposed O
to O
that O
mass O
kind O
of O
soul O
being O
enforced O
upon O
him O
by O
the O
Communist B-NORP
Chinese B-NORP
authorities O
, O
the O
social O
realism O
that O

would O
have O

Not O
only O
can O
this O

he O

He O
is O
best O

among O

He O
has O
had O
more O

30 B-CARDINAL
one B-CARDINAL

man O
shows O

his O

are O
quite O
delicately O
done O

there O
he O
is O
also O
very O
well O
known O
as O
a O

I O
think O
he O
has O
published O
about B-CARDINAL
18 I-CARDINAL

he O
writes O
his O

Just O
one B-CARDINAL

I O
wonder O

this O

`` O

What O
I O
want O

do O
is O
to O
use O
this O
opportunity O

speak O

Is O
that O

of O
all O

his O

Well O
, O
the O
work O
that O
we O
have O
so O
far O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE

suggests O
that O
, O
and O
indeed O
this O

is O
a O
celebration O
as O
well O
of O
the O
self O
of O
the O

goes O
so O
far O
as O
to O
even O
divide O

Characters O
proliferate O
out O

that O

Frank B-PERSON
? O

How O
many O
babies O
? O

Yes O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
know O
that O
-- O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
-- O


Um O
, O
well O
, O
initially O
how O
did O
you O
get O
the O
feeling O
that O
it O
would O
be O
really O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
deposition O
. O

Er O
, O
when O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
the O
victim O
, O
she O
did O
not O
want O
-- O
avoided O
us O
-- O
did O
not O
want O
to O
meet O
with O
us O
. O

She O
hid O
after O
you O
made O
the O
inquiry O
. O

Even O
if O
after O
you O
found O
her O
, O
she O
also O
-- O
once O
asked O
questions O
-- O
this O
thing O
did O
n't O
happen O
to O
me O
. O

Mainly O
out O
of O
fear O
, O
fear O
of O
retaliation O
, O
right O
. O

Yes O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

-- O

He O
was O
, O
for O
one O
thing O
, O
afraid O
of O
retaliation O
, O
and O
moreover O
, O
he O
was O
not O
sure O
whether O
this O
time O
you O
the O
police O
agency O
could O
execute O
a O
thorough O
crackdown O
. O

Right O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
perceive O
your O
resolution O
and O
your O
capabilities O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
how O
could O
you O
make O
a O
breakthrough O
. O

We O
did O
two B-QUANTITY
things O
to O
make O
a O
breakthrough O
in O
getting O
the O
deposition O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
we O
publicized O
to O
the O
masses O
our O
determination O
this O
time O
to O
fight O
against O
evil O
. O

Another O
thing O
was O
to O
publicize O
through O
scrolling O
media O
headlines O
. O

Well O
, O
their O
municipal O
bureau O
did O
some O
, O
did O
several O
runs O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
propaganda O
advertising O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
propaganda O
report O
on O
, O
um O
, O
TV O
, O
for O
example O
, O
saying O
that O
fighting O
evil O
has O
no O
timetable O
, O

So O
, O
the O
public O
was O
very O
afraid O
that O
you O
would O
fight O
for O
a O
while O
and O
then O
you O
would O
stop O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Was O
n't O
the O
investigation O
done O
in O
secret O
. O

How O
could O
there O
be O
propaganda O

Well O
, O
on O
December B-DATE
11 I-DATE
, O
I O
said O
, O
that O
is O
, O
four B-QUANTITY
criminal O
suspects O
who O
participated O
in O
special O
case O
1009 O
also O
turned O
themselves O
in O
, O
in O
Huainan B-GPE
City I-GPE
, O
another O
of O
our O
cities O
. O

So O
, O
by O
interrogating O
them O
, O
the O
details O
of O
the O
case O
became O
clear O
as O
well O
. O

Well O
, O
subsequently O
we O
thought O
that O
based O
on O
the O
information O
we O
previously O
obtained O
; O
it O
was O
time O
to O
go O
public O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O


The O
limits O
to O
legal O
absurdity O
stretched O
another O
notch O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
when O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
refused O
to O
hear O
an O
appeal O
from O
a O
case O
that O
says O
corporate O
defendants O
must O
pay O
damages O
even O
after O
proving O
that O
they O
could O
not O
possibly O
have O
caused O
the O
harm O
. O

We O
can O
understand O
and O
share O
the O
compassion O
that O
makes O
judges O
sometimes O
wish O
to O
offer O
a O
kind O
of O
Solomonic B-PERSON
aid O
to O
those O
who O
've O
been O
hurt O
. O

But O
this O
case O
is O
a O
stark O
lesson O
in O
how O
the O
failures O
of O
the O
traditional O
policy O
- O
making O
process O
have O
left O
the O
courts O
as O
the O
only O
forum O
this O
country O
has O
to O
debate O
risk O
, O
technology O
and O
innovation O
. O

Too O
often O
now O
, O
a O
single B-CARDINAL
court O
decision O
becomes O
the O
precedent O
for O
other O
, O
less O
compelling O
cases O
. O

From B-DATE
the I-DATE
1940s I-DATE
until I-DATE
1971 I-DATE
, O
some B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
women O
took O
the O
synthetic O
hormone O
diethylstilbestrol O
-LRB- O
DES O
-RRB- O
to O
prevent O
miscarriages O
and O
morning O
sickness O
. O

The O
drug O
was O
approved O
by O
the B-ORG
Food I-ORG
and I-ORG
Drug I-ORG
Administration I-ORG
and O
marketed O
by O
some B-CARDINAL
300 I-CARDINAL
pharmaceutical O
companies O
, O
often O
under O
generic O
labels O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
1970s I-DATE
, O
scientists O
reported O
cancer O
cases O
among O
the O
daughters O
of O
DES O
users O
. O

The O
cases O
quickly O
went O
to O
court O
, O
but O
the O
mothers O
of O
several B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
DES O
plaintiffs O
could O
n't O
recall O
whose O
brand O
they O
used O
. O

Beginning O
in O
1980 B-DATE
, O
courts O
in O
several O
states O
including O
California B-GPE
and O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
decided O
to O
suspend O
the O
common O
- O
law O
rule O
that O
plaintiffs O
must O
prove O
that O
the O
defendants O
are O
the O
ones O
who O
are O
liable O
. O

Courts O
made O
the O
assumption O
that O
all O
DES O
pills O
were O
essentially O
the O
same O
, O
and O
created O
a O
market O
- O
share O
test O
so O
that O
damages O
would O
be O
assessed O
against O
drug O
makers O
in O
the O
proportion O
of O
their O
share O
of O
the O
original O
sales O
. O

This O
has O
some O
logic O
. O

Drug O
makers O
should O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
duck O
liability O
because O
people O
could O
n't O
identify O
precisely O
which O
identical O
drug O
was O
used O
. O

But O
courts O
quickly O
tumbled O
down O
a O
slippery O
slope O
. O

Just O
as O
all O
plaintiffs O
are O
not O
alike O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
DES O
defendants O
marketed O
the O
drugs O
differently O
and O
may O
have O
offered O
different O
warranties O
. O

The O
ultimate O
result O
came O
in O
Hymowitz B-PERSON
v. O
Lilly B-ORG
, O
where O
the O
highest O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
court O
expanded O
the O
market O
- O
share O
approach O
for O
the O
first O
time O
to O
say O
that O
drug O
makers O
that O
could O
prove O
Mindy B-PERSON
Hymowitz I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
mother O
did O
n't O
use O
their O
pill O
must O
still O
pay O
their O
share O
of O
any O
damages O
. O

But O
as O
Duke B-ORG
University I-ORG
law O
professor O
William B-PERSON
Van I-PERSON
Alstyne I-PERSON
notes O
, O
by O
this O
reasoning O
a O
defendant O
could O
be O
held O
liable O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
for O
a O
bad O
apple O
even O
if O
he O
sold O
all O
his O
apples O
in O
California B-GPE
. O

Despite O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
's I-ORG
refusal O
to O
hear O
the O
case O
, O
there O
are O
serious O
constitutional O
issues O
of O
due O
process O
and O
uncompensated O
takings O
from O
the O
defendants O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
there O
's O
no O
guarantee O
that O
this O
reasoning O
will O
be O
limited O
to O
DES O
or O
to O
drugs O
. O

The O
problem O
here O
goes O
well O
beyond O
twisting O
legal O
doctrine O
. O

The B-ORG
California I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
reversed O
direction O
to O
make O
it O
much O
harder O
to O
win O
DES O
cases O
because O
the O
justices O
saw O
how O
all O
the O
pharmaceutical O
litigation O
has O
chilled O
the O
introduction O
of O
new O
drugs O
. O

The O
court O
rejected O
strict O
liability O
for O
prescription O
drugs O
, O
citing O
the O
huge O
, O
hidden O
social O
costs O
. O

`` O
Public O
policy O
favors O
the O
development O
and O
marketing O
of O
beneficial O
new O
drugs O
, O
even O
though O
some O
risks O
, O
perhaps O
serious O
ones O
, O
might O
accompany O
their O
introduction O
because O
drugs O
can O
save O
lives O
and O
reduce O
pain O
and O
suffering O
, O
'' O
the O
unanimous O
court O
said O
. O

The O
California B-GPE
justices O
noted O
that O
the O
fear O
of O
litigation O
already O
forced O
the O
only O
remaining O
anti-morning O
- O
sickness O
drug O
, O
Bendectin B-PRODUCT
, O
off O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
market O
. O

This O
raises O
the O
key O
issue O
: O
What O
to O
do O
about O
people O
who O
suffer O
serious O
injuries O
from O
beneficial O
drugs O
? O

We O
now O
know O
that O
holding O
drug O
makers O
liable O
where O
there O
's O
no O
evidence O
that O
they O
or O
anyone O
else O
knew O
of O
any O
risks O
only O
means O
the O
drugs O
wo O
n't O
be O
available O
to O
anyone O
. O

As O
liability O
expert O
Peter B-PERSON
Huber I-PERSON
tells O
us O
, O
after O
the O
Hymowitz B-PERSON
case O
, O
if O
any O
drug O
maker O
introduces O
an O
anti-miscarriage O
drug O
`` O
it O
's O
time O
to O
sell O
that O
company O
's O
stock O
short O
. O
'' O

We O
also O
know O
that O
the O
tort O
system O
is O
a O
lousy O
way O
to O
compensate O
victims O
anyway O
; O
some O
win O
the O
legal O
lottery O
, O
others O
get O
much O
less O
and O
contingency O
- O
fee O
lawyers O
take O
a O
big O
cut O
either O
way O
. O

DES O
daughters O
and O
other O
victims O
of O
drugs O
would O
be O
better O
off O
if O
their O
cases O
were O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
courts O
. O

Congress B-ORG
could O
create O
a O
compensation O
program O
to O
help O
such O
victims O
while O
protecting O
the O
national O
interest O
in O
encouraging O
new O
drugs O
. O

But O
a O
1986 B-DATE
law O
that O
supposedly O
replaced O
lawsuits O
over O
children O
's O
vaccines O
with O
a O
compensation O
fund O
has O
predictably O
led O
to O
even O
more O
litigation O
. O

Everyone O
by O
now O
understands O
that O
Congress B-ORG
is O
utterly O
incapable O
of O
writing O
legislation O
to O
help O
deserving O
people O
without O
its O
becoming O
some O
billion B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
dollar I-MONEY
morass O
. O

We O
have O
no O

this O
is O
one O
reason O
judges O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
and O
justices O
on O

are O
willing O
to O
trash O

of I-CARDINAL

Since O

the O

has O
bordered O
on O
civil O

China B-GPE

many O

and O
our O

If O
we O

so O
- O
called O

that O
is O
not O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O

what O

be O
many O

here O

China B-GPE

fall O

a O
situation O
of O

pale O

even O

it O
suits O
the O

of O
the O

no O

But O
so O
- O

just O
a O

some O

take O
democracy O

that O

the O

there O
is O
a O
huge O
difference O
between O
the O
current O
negotiations O
and O
the O
past O
negotiations O
. O

This O
huge O
difference O
is O
exactly O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
's I-GPE
change O
of O
status O
. O

An O
enormous O
change O
has O
taken O
place O
. O

Yeah O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
uh O
, O
the O
negotiations O
, O
uh O
, O
were O
conducted O
under O
the O
general O
suspicion O
that O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
had O
nuclear O
weapons O
and O
a O
nuclear O
program O
. O

Well O
, O
now O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
has O
already O
conducted O
a O
nuclear O
test O
, O
and O
well O
, O
it O
has O
also O
declared O
itself O
, O
like O
this O
, O
as O
a O
nuclear O
country O
, O
and O
wanted O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
talks O
in O
this O
role O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
several O
other O
parties O
, O
especially O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
are O
strongly O
opposed O
, O
and O
will O
absolutely O
not O
agree O
to O
it O
. O

Yet O
, O
here O
, O
we O
should O
see O
that O
there O
is O
still O
a O
certain O
level O
of O
flexibility O
at O
play O
here O
. O

However O
, O
the O
overall O
atmosphere O
still O
does O
n't O
give O
people O
much O
to O
be O
optimistic O
about O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
overall O
atmosphere O
, O
eh O
, O
under O
this O
, O
eh O
, O
just O
as O
we O
talked O
about O
before O
, O
the O
financial O
sanctions O
can O
be O
discussed O
in O
separate O
, O
separate O
groups O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
the O
US B-GPE
also O
sent O
a O
sort O
of O
message O
, O
ah O
, O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
er O
, O
actually O
earlier O
, O
eh O
, O
saying O
it O
could O
consider O
giving O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
some O
written O
assurance O
as O
well O
. O

That O
is O
, O
are O
n't O
you O
, O
this O
, O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
, O
very O
much O
concerned O
about O
your O
own O
security O
. O

Then O
the O
US B-GPE
can O
also O
consider O
giving O
this O
security O
assurance O
in O
, O
this O
, O
written O
form O
. O

Yeah O

stepped O

now O
a O
whole O

is O
taking O

as O
to O
why O
she O
stepped O
down O
, O
the O
job O
she O
's O
done O
when O
she O
was O
in O
office O

the O

, O
the O

News B-ORG

and O
Dan B-PERSON
, O
Whitman B-PERSON
did O
consider O
herself O
sort O
of O
the O
Republican B-NORP

, O
but O
now O
there O
's O
been O
an O
awful O
lot O
of O
Monday B-TIME
night I-TIME
quarterback O
quarterbacking O
taking O
place O
now O
that O
she O
's O
stepped O
down O
. O

What O
do O
you O
suppose O
took O
place O
here O
? O

I O
think O
many O
people O
have O
watched O
this O
administration O
in O
action O
and O
watched O
Christy B-PERSON
Whitman I-PERSON
in O
action O
. O

The O
mystery O
is O
that O
she O
took O
the O
job O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
or O
did O
n't O
leave O
earlier O
. O

She O
was O
quite O
a O
misfit O
for O
this O
administration O
, O
and O
she O
showed O
that O
over O
and O
over O
. O

She O
was O
not O
good O
at O
all O
at O
communicating O
the O
administration O
's O
message O
to O
the O
public O
and O
certainly O
to O
the O
environmental O
groups O
and O
she O
was O
even O
worse O
at O
bringing O
the O
EPA B-ORG
bureaucracy O
, O
the O
EPA B-ORG
environmental O
policy O
makers O
' O
message O
to O
this O
administration O
because O
she O
saw O
herself O
undercut O
over O
and O
over O
. O

That O
's O
interesting O
because O
leading O
into O
it O
, O
while O
she O
was O
New B-GPE
Jersey I-GPE
governor O
, O
she O
sued O
the O
EPA B-ORG
and O
she O
was O
very O
much O
considering O
herself O
to O
be O
an O
environmentalist O
, O
and O
then O
only O
to O
end O
up O
becoming O
the O
head O
of O
the O
EPA B-ORG
and O
then O
of O
course O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
criticism O
over O
relaxed O
regulations O
. O

Let O
's O
hear O
what O
she O
had O
to O
say O
last B-DATE
Wednesday I-DATE
here O
on O
CNN O
just O
after O
announcing O
her O
resignation O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
leaving O
because O
of O
clashes O
with O
the O
administration O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
. O

I O
report O

the O
President O
, O
and O
he O
has O
always O
asked O
me O
to O
give O
him O
my O
best O
unadulterated O
advice O

We O
have O
have O
been O
on O
the O

I O
was O
never O
supportive O
of O

it O
did O
n't O
do O
what O
everyone O

to O
get O

as O
far O
as O

I O

it O

the O

it O

Dan O
, O
do O
you O
agree O
with O
that O
? O

She O
says O
the O
appropriate O
time O

Do O
you O
suppose O
for O
personal O
reasons O
or O
perhaps O
she O
was O
out O

with O
the O
administration O
? O

I O
'm O
sure O
that O
it O
was O
difficult O
for O
her O
personally O
, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
commuter O
marriage O
perhaps O
would O
have O
been O
less O
stressful O
if O
everyday O
she O
did O
n't O

last B-DATE

deadly O
bombing O
of O
the O
destroyer O
USS B-PRODUCT
Cole I-PRODUCT

VOA B-ORG
Pentagon B-FAC
correspondent O
Alex B-PERSON
Belida I-PERSON
reports O
, O
the O
new O
timeline O
raises O
new O
questions O
about O
how O
the O
apparent O
terrorist O
attack O
was O
carried O
out O
. O

The O
Navy B-ORG
now O
says O
the O
blast O
occurred O
nearly B-TIME
two I-TIME
hours I-TIME
after O
the O
destroyer O
had O
moored O
for O
refueling O
in O
Aden B-FAC
Harbor I-FAC
, O
not O
during O
the O
mooring O
operation O
itself O
. O

Originally O
Navy B-ORG
officials O
said O
a O
small O
boat O
that O
assisted O
in O
securing O
the O
ship O
's O
lines O
or O
whose O
movements O
were O
masked O
by O
the O
mooring O
operation O
pulled O
aside O
the O
Cole B-PRODUCT
and O
blew O
up O
in O
an O
apparent O
suicide O
attack O
. O

A O
Navy B-ORG
spokesman O
, O
Commander O
Greg B-PERSON
Smith I-PERSON
offers O
no O
new O
explanation O
of O
the O
circumstances O
leading O
to O
the O
blast O
, O
saying O
that O
is O
now O
a O
matter O
for O
criminal O
investigators O
. O

However O
, O
Commander O
Smith B-PERSON
says O
, O
the O
Navy B-ORG
remains O
firm O
in O
its O
assessment O
that O
the O
explosion O
was O
the O
result O
of O
a O
terrorist O
attack O
and O
not O
a O
refueling O
accident O
, O
even O
though O
the O
new O
time O
table O
confirms O
refueling O
was O
underway O
. O

That O
raises O
questions O
about O
how O
a O
single O
boat O
could O
have O
approached O
without O
raising O
the O
suspicions O
of O
armed O
guards O
posted O
as O
part O
of O
the O
heightened O
alert O
status O
required O
for O

Howard B-PERSON

announcements O
came O
after O
speculation O
that O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

was O
planning O
to O
increase O
the O

Howard B-PERSON

if O
the O

but O
that O
did O
not O

that O

do O
the O

He O
added O
that O
" O
The O
situation O
at O
the O

will O
depend O
on O
the O
situation O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
; O
the O
thing O
we O
wo O
n't O
do O
is O
to O
be O
part O
of O
any O

, O
as O
it O
grants O

to O
the O

" O
. O

Howard B-PERSON
admitted O
that O
Australia B-GPE
depends O
on O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

, O
and O
asserted O
the O
necessity O
to O
continue O
this O
alliance O
. O

Australia B-GPE
, O

supporter O
of O
the O

1,400 B-QUANTITY

There O
are O
speculations O
that O
the B-GPE

has O
asked O
Australia B-GPE
to O
send O
more O
troops O
to O
Iraq B-GPE

Government O

Federal B-ORG

Chairman O

on O

making O
it O
clear O
to O

in O

that O
the O

prepared O

carefully O

But O
the O

feared O
that O
any O

only O
increase O

jitters O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
officials O
at O
the O
Fed B-ORG

in O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
decided O
that O
avoiding O
overt O
actions O

over O
the B-DATE

give O

more O
strength O

this O

`` O
The O

that O
anything O

The O

Buick B-ORG
approached O
American B-ORG

about O

`` O
we O

adds O

were O
roughly O
flat O

the B-DATE

began O
Oct. B-DATE
1 I-DATE
, O
Buick B-ORG
sales O
have O
plunged O
33 B-PERCENT

For O
American B-ORG
Express I-ORG
, O
the O
promotion O
is O
part O
of O
an O
effort O
to O
broaden O
the O
use O
of O
its O

, O
where O
the O

expects O

get O
much O

the O
future O
growth O
in O
its O

Traditionally O

all O

realize O

could O

GM B-ORG
finance O

But O
GMAC B-ORG
approved O
the O
Buick B-ORG
program O
, O
he O
says O
, O
because O
the O
American B-ORG

green O

requires O
payment O
in O
full O

so O

Drexel B-ORG
says O
it O
does O

expect O

and O

Still O
, O
if O
nothing O
else O
, O
a O
revoked O
brokerage O

could O
be O
a O
burden O
because O
it O
must O
be O
disclosed O
in O
many O
of O
the O
transactions O
in O
which O
Drexel B-ORG
could O
be O

they O
disagree O
about O
the O

give O
to O
the O
public O

`` O
There O

The O

is O
whether O

should O
be O
allowed O
to O
pay O

`` O

that O

modern O

went O

chose O

The O

kept O
it O
for O
them O
in O
the O
records O

pride O

They O
hastily O
executed O
him O
because O
they O
feared O
him O
even O
when O
he O
was O
behind O
bars O
, O
just O
as O
they O
will O
still O
fear O
him O
as O
a O
corpse O
hidden O
under O
the O

, O
and O
comparisons O

his O
time O

the O

Iraq B-GPE

its O
crisis O

the O
corrupt O

that O
governs O
it O
have O
become O
deafening O
to O
the O
ears O
of O
the O
occupation O

its O
accomplices O
. O

He O
embarrassed O
them O
and O
dwarfed O
them O
by O
standing O
as O
a O
spear O
in O
the O
prisoner O

dock O
. O

They O
were O
terrified O
by O
the O
penetrating O
looks O
of O
his O
eyes O
. O

They O
were O
exposed O
by O
his O
patriotism O

Arabism B-NORP
and O
his O
contempt O
for O
the O
odious O
sectarian O
divisions O
that O
they O
planted O
in O
their O
contaminated O

they O

said O

" O

Is O
it O
manliness O
to O
shout O
hateful O
sectarian O
slogans O
in O
front O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
never O
been O
sectarian O
, O
and O
the O
rope O
of O
the O
gallows O
is O
being O
wound O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
his O
soul O
will O
go O
to O
its O
Creator O
in O
a O
few O
seconds O
? O

Are O
these O
the O
tolerant O
ethics O
of O
Islam B-ORG
? O

Are O
these O
the O
values O
of O
Arabism B-NORP
, O
decency O
, O
and O
pride O
? O

Are O
those O
the O
sons O
of O
the O
great O
Iraq B-GPE
which O
had O
always O
stood O
up O
against O
invaders O
throughout O
history O
and O
was O
a O
pillar O
of O
support O
for O
its O
nation O
and O
the O
causes O
of O
justice O
in O
the O
world O
as O
a O
whole O
? O

We O
are O
sorry O
, O
but O
not O
surprised O
, O
because O
some O
Arab B-NORP
governments O
objected O
only O
because O
the O
execution O
took O
place O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
feast I-DATE
of I-DATE
Bairam I-DATE
, O
as O
if O
the O
execution O
of O
this O
man O
would O
have O
been O
permissible O
and O
blessed O
on O
any B-DATE
other I-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

We O
are O
sorry O
again O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
leaders O
hid O
in O
their O
palaces O
and O
none O
of O
them O
dared O
to O
speak O
even O
one B-CARDINAL
word O
of O
protest O
out O
of O
fear O
of O
America B-GPE
. O

We O
were O
stabbed O
twice O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
when O
we O
watched O
an O
Arab B-NORP
leader O
being O
led O
to O
the O
gallows O
in O
accordance O
with O
sectarian O
justice O
which O
is O
spiteful O
and O
vengeful O
. O
And O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
time O
when O
we O
did O
not O
see O
anyone O
among O
the O
club O
of O
leaders O
to O
which O
he O
belonged O
for O
more O
than O
30 B-CARDINAL
years O
object O
to O
his O
execution O
. O

Maybe O
God O
wanted O
a O
good O
end O
for O
him O
, O
and O
a O
good O
reputation O
, O
when O
He O
induced O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
to O
record O
what O
America B-GPE
and O
the O
government O
of O
sects O
wanted O
to O
hide O
, O
by O
means O
of O
the O
video O
of O
the O
last B-ORDINAL
moments O
, O
which O
created O
a O
historic O
turning O
point O
that O
will O
perhaps O
shape O
the O
history O
of O
the O
region O
, O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
events O
in O
it O
for O
decades B-DATE
to I-DATE
come I-DATE
. O

Maybe O
God O
wanted O
to O
expose O
the O
series O
of O
lies O
of O
Muwaffaq B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Rabi I-PERSON
the O
National O
Security O
Advisor O
in O
the O
government O
of O
occupation O
. O
-LRB- O
Where O
is O
that O
security O
? O
-RRB- O
, O
who O
went O
out O
to O
the O
world O
saying O
that O
he O
, O
meaning O
President O
Saddam B-PERSON
, O
was O
weak O
and O
collapsing O
while O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
meet O
his O
God O
. O

Then O
the O
tape O
comes O
along O
and O
shows O
us O
with O
sound O
and O
image O
that O
we O
are O
in O
front O
of O
a O
courageous O
lion O
, O
who O
refuses O
to O
wear O
the O
mask O
, O
just O
as O
he O
refused O
to O
take O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
they O
offered O
him O
. O

Why O
the O
mask O
, O
and O
why O
the O
pills O
? O

The O
mask O
is O
for O
traitors O
and O
criminals O
who O
are O
ashamed O
of O
their O
treason O
or O
their O
crimes O
, O
and O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
are O
appropriate O
for O
those O
who O
can O
not O
face O
history O
because O
of O
their O
bad O
deeds O
. O

The O
American B-NORP
administration O
committed O
a O
fatal O
mistake O
and O
revealed O
a O
major O
foolishness O
to O
be O
added O
to O
its O
many O
foolishnesses O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
when O
it O
executed O
this O
man O
, O
in O
a O
way O
for O
which O
it O
will O
pay O
a O
hefty O
price O
in O
the B-DATE
near I-DATE
future I-DATE
. O

His O
survival O
would O
have O
benefited O
it O
much O
more O
than O
his O
execution O
if O
they O
understood O
politics O
as O
they O
should O
, O
because O
his O
survival O
could O
have O
been O
a O
card O
to O
threaten O
the O
sectarians O
and O
keep O
them O
as O
servants O
to O
them O
and O
their O
schemes O
, O
just O
as O
it O
could O
have O
been O
a O
bargaining O
chip O
for O
calming O
down O
the O
resistance O
and O
the O
broad O
Iraqi B-NORP
sector O
which O
supports O
it O
. O

But O
they O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
except O
grudges O
, O
and O
they O
do O
not O
want O
anything O
other O
than O
inflicting O
more O
degradation O
on O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
and O
Muslims B-NORP
by O
his O
execution O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
American B-NORP
administration O
will O
have O
succeeded O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
only O
, O
intentionally O
and O
with O
planning O
or O
without O
it O
, O
namely O
, O
deepening O
the O
sectarian O
breach O
not O
only O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
but O
in O
the O
Islamic B-NORP
world O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

It O
was O
not O
by O
coincidence O
that O
Nouri B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki I-PERSON
signed O
the O
decision O
to O
carry O
out O

And O
it O
was O
also O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
coincidence O
that O
the O
task O
of O
carrying O
it O
out O
was O
assigned O
to O
spiteful O
sectarians O
as O
we O

it O
a O

This O
execution O
will O
deal O
a O
strong O
blow O
to O
all O
the O
efforts O

It O

to O
the O
escalation O
of O

against O
the O
American B-NORP

those O

do O
not O
want O

maintain O

Rather O
, O
they O
are O
working O

blow O
it O
up O

tolerance O

are O
basic O
characteristics O
not O

Saddam B-PERSON
had O
negative O

positive O
traits O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
killed O
because O
of O
his O
negative O
traits O

rather O
because O
of O
his O
positive O

which O
were O
his O

The O

that O

the O

I O

Well O
, O
matter O

fact O

is O
that O
if O
the O

were O
left O

perhaps O
there O
would O
be O
a O
possibility O

success O

the O

. O

But O
unfortunately O
, O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
crisis O
at O
this O
time O
in O
particular O
defies O
resolution O
, O
because O
the O
key O

the O
solution O
is O
not O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
any O
of O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
key O
to O
the O
solution O
right O
now O
is O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
. O

And O
since O
the O
American B-NORP
orientation O
so O
far O
has O
not O
been O
completely O
elaborated O
, O
especially O
after O
, O
the O
Baker B-PERSON
- O
Hamilton B-PERSON
report O
, O
in O
my O
estimation O
, O
the O
situation O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
will O
remain O
pending O
the O
clarification O
of O
perceptions O
that O
the O
American B-NORP

wants O

adopt O

the O
level O

a O
whole O

Consequently O
, O
Lebanon B-GPE
in O
this O

does O
not O
, O
you O
know O

represent O
an O
independent O
issue O

the O

The B-TIME
next I-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
August B-DATE
1998 I-DATE
, O
the O
FBI B-ORG
sent O
out O
a O
classified O
message O
, O
under O
Director O
Louis B-PERSON
Freeh I-PERSON
's O
name O
, O
warning O
of O
a O
plot O
to O
attack O
a O
U.S. B-ORG
Navy I-ORG
ship O
in O
Yemen B-GPE
. O

The O
FBI B-ORG
message O
went O
to O
three B-CARDINAL
Pentagon B-ORG
agencies O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
, O
the O
visit O
of O
one O
American B-NORP
warship O
to O
Yemen B-GPE
was O
canceled O
. O

The O
warning O
came O
as O
General O
Anthony B-PERSON
Zinni I-PERSON
was O
finalizing O
an O
agreement O
for O
refueling O
ships O
in O
the O
Yemeni B-NORP
port O
of O
Aden B-GPE
. O

It O
apparently O
left O
no O
lasting O
impression O
. O

Zinni B-PERSON
testifying O
after O
the O
attack O
on O
the B-PRODUCT
`` I-PRODUCT
USS I-PRODUCT
Cole I-PRODUCT
'' I-PRODUCT
-- O
Aden B-GPE
never O
had O
a O
specific O
terrorist O
threat O
. O

All O
the O
other O

that O
have O
been O
mentioned O
here O
that O
we O
should O
have O
considered O
as O
options O
have O
had O
specific O
threats O
. O

So O
what O
happened O
to O
the O
FBI B-ORG
warning O
? O

CIA B-ORG
officials O
say O
they O
never O
received O
it O
. O

FBI B-ORG
officials O
say O
they O
did O
copy O
the O
CIA B-ORG
. O

Pentagon B-ORG
officials O
say O
they O
got O
the O
warning O
, O
but O
had O
no O
idea O
it O
the O
source O
was O
such O
a O
well O
- O
connected O
insider O
within O
Bin B-PERSON
Laden I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
organization O
. O

This O
raises O
a O
fundamental O
question O
-- O
if O
the O
message O
had O
been O
more O
clearly O
communicated O
and O
understood O
, O
would O
American B-NORP
lives O
have O
been O
saved O
? O

Everybody O
has O
their O
own O
reasons O
for O
choosing O
a O
university O
; O
because O
the O
cost O
of O
living O
in O
Hefei B-GPE
is O
cheaper O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
my O
parents O
to O
spend O
all O
their O
money O
, O
I O
chose O
the B-ORG
University I-ORG
of I-ORG
Science I-ORG
and I-ORG
Technology I-ORG
of I-ORG
China I-ORG
. O

Years B-DATE
later I-DATE
, O
looking O
back O
on O
this O
choice O
, O
I O
certainly O
do O
not O
have O
any O
regrets O
. O

Perhaps O
if O
I O
'd O
chosen O
two B-CARDINAL
schools O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
I O
would O
n't O
be O
here O
today O
talking O
about O
how O
USTC B-ORG
is O
. O

But O
USTC B-ORG
at O
the O
time O
was O
weak O
; O
considering O
location O
, O
expenses O
, O
promotion O
and O
connections O
, O
USTC B-ORG
's O
greatest O
wealth O
was O
its O
students O
. O

If O
we O
had O
n't O
come O
forward O
and O
done O
something O
for O
USTC B-ORG
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
finished O
. O

This O
is O
also O
the O
main O
reason O
USTC B-ORG
students O
banded O
together O
. O

Because O
I O
chose O
science O
and O
technology O
as O
my O
career O
, O
I O
am O
grateful O
to O
USTC B-ORG
for O
teaching O
me O
many O
things O
, O
and O
I O
am O
grateful O
to O
the O
reputation O
established O
by O
the O
previous O
president O
of O
the O
university O
, O
who O
enabled O
those O
who O
came O
after O
to O
benefit O
from O
it O
. O

Precisely O
because O
I O
feel O
this O
gratitude O
, O
I O
want O
to O
repay O
USTC B-ORG
. O

I O
regularly O
do O
my O
job O
properly O
and O
do O
not O
let O
USTC B-ORG
lose O
face O
. O

I O
want O
to O
save O
money O
out O
of O
my O
meager O
fellowship O
to O
help O
a O
poor O
university O
student O
with O
his O
living O
expenses O
for O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

I O
want O
to O
go O
back O
to O
China B-GPE
to O
make O
my O
contributions O
; O
I O
also O
want O
to O
provide O
the O
needed O
help O
to O
future O
students O
of O
my O
university O
. O

When O
I O
see O
people O
attacking O
USTC B-ORG
, O
I O
sometimes O
want O
to O
take O
the O
time O
to O
defend O
it O
, O
even O
though O
that O
may O
not O
help O
much O
. O

Those O
USTC B-ORG
haters O
have O
their O
own O
reasons O
; O
I O
do O
n't O
intend O
to O
change O
their O
thinking O
. O

But O
with O
China B-GPE
's O
universities O
being O
so O
backward O
, O
what O
contributions O
have O
these O
naysayers O
really O
made O
to O
their O
alma O
maters O
and O
their O
country O
? O

Like O
gaddy B-PERSON
, O
for O
example O
, O
who O
first O
badmouths O
USTC B-ORG
students O
for O
not O
wanting O
to O
contribute O
money O
, O
says O
he O
himself O
has O
some O
money O
, O
and O
then O
wants O
to O
spend O
money O
filing O
a O
lawsuit O
because O
of O
a O
dispute O
over O
personal O
feelings O
on O
the O
bbs O
. O

This O
hater O
really O
has O
some O
problems O
of O
his O
own O
. O

After O
graduating O
, O
I O
will O
go O
back O
; O
no O
matter O
where O
I O
work O
, O
I O
'm O
still O
a O
USTC B-ORG
student O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
regrets O
about O
USTC B-ORG
and O
no O
regrets O
about O
my O
country O

Friday B-DATE
's O
190 B-CARDINAL
- O
point O
plunge O
in O
stocks O
does O
not O
come O
atop O
the O
climate O
of O
anxiety O
that O
dominated O
financial O
markets O
just O
prior O
to O
their O
1987 B-DATE
October I-DATE
crash O
, O
and O
mechanisms O
have O
been O
put O
in O
place O
to O
keep O
markets O
more O
orderly O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
lesson O
is O
about O
the O
same O
: O
On O
Friday B-DATE
the I-DATE
13th I-DATE
, O
the O
market O
was O
spooked O
by O
Washington B-GPE
. O

The O
consensus O
along O
the O
street O
seems O
to O
be O
that O
the O
plunge O
was O
triggered O
by O
the O
financing O
problems O
of O
the O
UAL B-ORG
takeover O
, O
and O
it O
's O
certainly O
true O
the O
rout O
began O
immediately O
after O
the O
UAL B-ORG
trading O
halt O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
consensus O
seems O
almost O
as O
wide O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
faltering O
bid O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
write O
down O
the O
value O
of O
all O
U.S. B-GPE
business O
. O

This O
observation O
leads O
us O
to O
another O
piece O
of O
news O
moving O
on O
the O
Dow B-ORG
Jones I-ORG
ticker O
shortly O
before O
the O
downturn O
: O
the O
success O
of O
Senate B-ORG
Democrats B-NORP
in O
stalling O
the O
capital O
gains O
tax O
cut O
. O

The O
real O
value O
of O
all O
shares O
, O
after O
all O
, O
is O
directly O
impacted O
by O
the O
tax O
on O
any O
profits O
-LRB- O
all O
the O
more O
so O
given O
the O
limits O
on O
deductions O
for O
losses O
that O
show O
gains O
are O
not O
`` O
ordinary O
income O
'' O
-RRB- O
. O

And O
market O
expectations O
clearly O
have O
been O
raised O
by O
the O
capital O
gains O
victory O
in O
the O
House B-ORG
last B-DATE
month I-DATE
. O

An B-TIME
hour I-TIME
before O
Friday B-DATE
's O
plunge O
, O
that O
provision O
was O
stripped O
from O
the O
tax O
bill O
, O
leaving O
it O
with O
$ B-MONEY
5.4 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
in O
tax O
increases O
without O
a O
capital O
gains O
cut O
. O

There O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
be O
said O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
for O
stripping O
the O
garbage O
out O
of O
the O
reconciliation O
bill O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
if O
Congress B-ORG
started O
to O
decide O
issues O
one O
- O
by O
- O
one B-CARDINAL
on O
their O
individual O
merits O
without O
trickery O
. O

For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
no O
one O
doubts O
that O
the O
capital O
gains O
cut O
would O
pass O
on O
an O
up O
- O
or O
- O
down O
vote O
. O

Since O
Senate B-ORG
leaders O
have O
so O
far O
fogged O
it O
up O
with O
procedural O
smokescreens O
, O
promises O
of O
a O
cleaner O
bill O
are O
suspect O
. O

Especially O
so O
since O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
been O
weakened O
by O
the O
Panama B-GPE
fiasco O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
that O
the O
UAL B-ORG
troubles O
contributed O
to O
the O
plunge O
, O
they O
are O
another O
instance O
of O
Washington B-GPE
's O
sticky O
fingers O
. O

As O
the O
best O
opportunities O
for O
corporate O
restructurings O
are O
exhausted O
of O
course O
, O
at O
some O
point O
the O
market O
will O
start O
to O
reject O
them O
. O

But O
the O
airlines O
are O
scarcely O
a O
clear O
case O
, O
given O
anti-takeover O
mischief O
by O
Secretary O
of O
Transportation B-ORG
Skinner B-PERSON
, O
who O
professes O
to O
believe O
safety O
will O
be O
compromised O
if O
KLM B-ORG
and O
British B-ORG
Airways I-ORG
own O
interests O
in O
companies O
that O
fly O
airplanes O
. O

Worse O
, O
Congress B-ORG
has O
started O
to O
jump O
on O
the O
Skinner B-PERSON
bandwagon O
. O

James B-PERSON
Oberstar I-PERSON
, O
the O
Minnesota B-GPE
Democrat B-NORP
who O
chairs O
the O
Public B-ORG
Works I-ORG
and I-ORG
Transportation I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
's I-ORG
aviation O
subcommittee O
, O
has O
put O
an O
anti-airline O
takeover O
bill O
on O
supersonic O
speed O
so O
that O
it O
would O
be O
passed O
in O
time O
to O
affect O
the O
American B-ORG
and O
United B-ORG
Air I-ORG
Lines I-ORG
bids O
. O

It O
would O
give O
Mr. O
Skinner B-PERSON
up B-DATE
to I-DATE
50 I-DATE
days I-DATE
to O
`` O
review O
'' O
any O
bid O
for O
15 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
or O
more O
of O
the O
voting O
stock O
of O
any O
U.S. B-GPE
carrier O
with O
revenues O
of O
$ B-MONEY
1 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
or O
more O
. O

So O
the O
UAL B-ORG
deal O
has O
problems O
, O
and O
the O
market O
loses O
190 B-CARDINAL
points O
. O

Congratulations O
, O
Mr. O
Secretary O
and O
Mr. O
Congressman O
. O

In O
the O
1987 B-DATE
crash O
, O
remember O
, O
the O
market O
was O
shaken O
by O
a O
Danny B-PERSON
Rostenkowski I-PERSON
proposal O
to O
tax O
takeovers O
out O
of O
existance O
. O

Even O
more O
important O
, O
in O
our O
view O
, O
was O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
's O
threat O
to O
thrash O
the O
dollar O
. O

The O
Treasury B-ORG
is O
doing O
the O
same O
thing O
today B-DATE
; O
thankfully O
, O
the O
dollar O
is O
not O
under O
1987 B-DATE
- O
style O
pressure O
. O

Also O
, O
traders O
are O
in O
better O
shape O
today B-DATE
than O
in O
1987 B-DATE
to O
survive O
selling O
binges O
. O

They O
are O
better O
capitalized O
. O

They O
are O
in O
less O
danger O
of O
losing O
liquidity O
simply O
because O
of O
tape O
lags O
and O
clearing O
and O
settlement O
delays O
. O

The O
Fed B-ORG
promises O
any O
needed O
liquidity O
. O

The B-ORG
Big I-ORG
Board I-ORG
's I-ORG
liaison O
with O
the B-ORG
Chicago I-ORG
Board I-ORG
of I-ORG
Trade I-ORG
has O
improved O
; O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
learn O
if O
`` O
circuit O
breakers O
'' O
prove O
to O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

In O
any O
event O
, O
some O
traders O
see O
stocks O
as O
underpriced O
today B-DATE
, O
unlike O
1987 B-DATE
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O
market O
that O
ca O
n't O
be O
cured O
by O
a O
little O
coherence O
and O
common O
sense O
in O
Washington B-GPE
. O

But O
on O
the O
bearish O
side O
, O
that O
may O
be O
too O
much O
to O
expect O
. O


I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
gave O
me O
an O
address O
, O
though O
. O

I O
might O
not O
ha- O
not O
have O
had O
one O
then O
. O

Right O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
get O
it O
right O
at O
first O
. O

So O

So O
, O
when O
did O
you O
get O
there O
? O

I O
started O
work O
August B-DATE
first I-DATE

so O

's O

I O
arrived O

the O
night O
before O
I O
started O
work O

so O
I O
had O
been O
here O
just O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

It O
will O
be O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
Tuesday B-DATE
That O
I O
started O
work O

and O
%um O
so O
I O
worked O
in O
the O
office O
for O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
in I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE

and O
then O
we O
had O
our O
orientation O
for O
the O
new O
volunteers O

uh-huh O

was O
out O
in O
western B-LOC
Michigan I-LOC
on O
Lake B-LOC
Michigan I-LOC
about B-TIME
four I-TIME
hours I-TIME
from O

went O

and O
spent O
a O
week O
almost B-DATE
a I-DATE
week I-DATE
%um O

From O
Omaha B-GPE

. O

Wow O
. O

It O
took O
a O
couple O
days O

it O
[background_noise_, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
maybe O
fourteen B-CARDINAL
or O
fifteen B-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
do O
it O
all O
in O
one O
day O

so O
I O
broke O
it O
up O
and O
stopped O
in O
Wisconsin B-GPE
at O
a O
friend O
's O
house O

Right O

So O
so O
anyway O
we O
have O
fifty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
new O
volunteers O
that O
are O
oriented O
and O
off O
. O

They O
left O

Detroit B-GPE
. O

in O
September B-DATE
for O
just O
a O
a O
three B-CARDINAL
day O
weekend O

something O

that O
%um O
because O
September B-DATE
is O
pretty O
much O
the O
slo- O
one O
of O
the O
slowest O
months O
on O
the O
job O

so O

mhm O

And O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
to O
Texas B-GPE
in O
a O
while O

so O
I O
thought O
that O

%um O
then O
at O
Christmas B-EVENT
time O
I O
think O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
my O
cou- O

of O
my O
cousins O

'm O
hoping O
my O
family O

just O
come O
up O

Kansas B-GPE
for O
that O

%mm O
. O

mhm O

And O
then O
I O
'll O
go O
there O
and O
see O
them O

so O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
Thanksgiving B-EVENT
yet O
. O

That O
's O
too O
far O
away O
to O
figure O
out O

so O
anyway O
I O
will O
be O
. O

Gosh O
, O
are O
you O
happy O
? O

yeah O
, O

I O
am O

I O
it O
was O
really O
hard O
to O
make O
the O
decision O

I O
actually O
at O
one O
point O
decided O
no O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
go O

I O
I O
just O
like O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
want O
to O
start O
all O
over O
again O

and O
-- O
mhm O
. O
I O
'm O
I O
'm O
liking O
being O
in O
Omaha B-GPE
and O
all O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O

and O
so O
I O
called O
and O
and O
told O
the O
director O
you O
know O
I O
thought O
about O
it O
a O
lot O
blah O
blah O
blah O

but O
I O
%eh O
just O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
right O
for O
me O
right O
now O

and O
mhm O
He O
was O
like O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
him O
very O
well O

but O
%uh O
he O
'd O
he O
had O
strep O
throat O
when O
I O
was O
here O

I O
mean O
he O
just O
was O
n't O
feeling O
well O

I O
mean O
was O
like O
well O
. O

mhm O
. O

okay O

and O
%uh O
later O
that O
morning O
Kate B-PERSON
called O
me O
at O
work O
in O
in O
Omaha B-GPE
. O

And O
I O
'm O
like O
Kate B-PERSON
are O
calling O
to O
make O
this O
really O
hard O
on O
me O

an- O
? O

%eh O

She O
's O
like O
we O
just O
want O
you O
to O
think O
about O
one O
more O
thing O

and O
%eh O
the O
job O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
a O
two O
year O
commitment O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
, O
and O
that O
was O
kind O
of O
like O
one O
of O
the O
things O
that O
I O
'm O
thinking O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
about O
doing O
a O
two B-DATE
year I-DATE
commitment O
%eh O
you O
know O
all O

wonderful O

That O

great O
. O

%mm O
. O
And O
that O
's O
more O
important O
to O
me O
than O

so O

Right O

yeah O

So O
, O
and O
we O
take O
we O
get O
the O
whole O
week O
from O
Chri- O
Christmas B-EVENT
to O

Year I-EVENT

that O
's O
one O
of O
our O
weeks O
of O

only O
mhm O
. O
you O

I O

you O
work O
it O
around O
your O
schedule O
. O

Right O
. O

yeah O
, O

you O
got O
to O
work O
it O
around O
your O
schedule O
which O
is O

i- O
in O
you O
know O
summer O
is O
not O
a O
really O
good O
time O
to O
take O
it O
because O
you O
're O
ending O
one B-DATE
year I-DATE
and O
starting O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
and O
you O
know O
doing O
a O
lot O
with O
the O
p- O
the O
volunteers O
coming O
in O

mhm O
. O

-- O
so O
I O
'll O
probably O
try O
to O
take O
most O
of O
it O
before O
next O
summer O
, O

we O
'll O
see O
. O

mhm O
. O

%um O
so O
I O
tho- O
I O
thought O
about O
it O
that O
day O

and O
I O
ended O
up O
calling O
back O
and O
saying O
okay O
I O
'm O
coming O
to O
Detroit B-GPE

so O
It O
's O
been O
really O
good O
since O
I O
've O

I O
mean O
actually O
I O
made O
the O
decision O

and O
I O
thought O
oh O
God O
what O
am O
I O
doing O
you O
know O

I O
'm O
I O
just O
was O
still O
unsure O
about O
it O

but O
within O
in O
a O
couple O
days O
I O
just O
felt O
really O
at O
peace O
with O
it O
and O
remained O
so O
throughout O
the O
time O
that O
I O
prepared O
to O
leave O

and O
then O
ever O
since O
I O
've O
been O
here O
I O
keep O
thinking O
okay O
why O
am O
I O
so O
okay O
with O
this O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
be O
falling O
apart O
any O
minute O
, O
right O
you O
know O
? O

Because O
I O
'm O
really O
used O
to O
transition O
hitting O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
harder O
especially O
when O
I O
was O
so O
ambivalent O
about O
the O
decision O

but O
Right O
. O
%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
's O
been O
great O

That O
's O
great O
. O

So O

yeah O
. O

Great O
. O

Do O
n't O
question O
it O
? O

Go O
with O
it O

yeah O

exac- O

that O
's O
what O
I O
said O
finally O
%um O

I O
was O
telling O
somebody O

somebody O
is O
like O
well O
how O
you O
doing O
? O

I O
said O
well O
I O
I O
'm O
fine O
you O
know O

I O
keep O
wondering O
how O
long O
that O
's O
going O
to O
last O
. O

I O
'm O
fine O

what O
's O
wrong O
with O
me O

and O
then O
finally O
I O
'm O
like O
you O
know O
I O
am O
just O
going O
to O
be O
okay O
that O
I O
'm O
okay O

and O
if O
I O
'm O
not O
okay O
later O
that O
's O
fine O

but O
right O
now O
I O
'm O
okay O

I O
have O
to O
stop O
wondering O
when O
it O
's O
going O
to O
end O

so O
. O
So O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
where O
I O
've O
been O
. O

You O

though O

wedding O

and O
Kate B-PERSON
Katie B-PERSON
and O
I O
, O

housemate O
from O
Oregon B-GPE
went O
together O

. O

and O

a O
cab O
back O

and O
then O
the O
train O
back O
to O
Long B-GPE
Island I-GPE

so O
I O
mean O
that O
was O
it O
. O

That O
's O
all O
we O
saw O
. O

oh O
that O
was O
it O
. O

%um O
and O
I O
liked O
that O

but O
it O
just O
it O
did O
n't O
even O
feel O
like O
I O
had O
actually O
been O
in O
the O
city O
you O
know O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O

did O
a O
lot O
of O

**touristy** O
stuff O
and O
walked O
on O
the B-FAC
Brooklyn I-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
and O

and O
%um O

in O
Central B-LOC
Park I-LOC
and O
went O
to O
a O
show O
and O
all O
that O
sort O
of O
stuff O

so O

also O
went O
out O
to O
to O
Long B-GPE

where O
Joe B-PERSON
's O
mom O
lives O
-- O
uh-huh O
. O
and O
spent O
time O
with O
the O
whole O
family O
So O
-- O
which O
was O
which O
was O
okay O
. O

It O
was O
good O
. O

. O
At O
first O
when O
we O
had O
were O
planning O
the O
trip O
he O
had O
he O
's O
like O
oh O
I O
hope O
we O
can O
go O
out O
and O
you O
know O
go O
to O
the O
beach O
and O
you O
can O
meet O
my O
my O

and O
nephe- O

he O
's O
got O
four O
brothers O
three B-CARDINAL
brothers O

%um O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
live O

. O

You O
want O
to O
meet O
my O
brothers O
and O
my O
nieces O
and O
nephews O

and O
I O
'm O
like O
%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
Joe B-PERSON

I O
do O
n't O

I O
said O
I O
I O
think O
maybe O
we O
need O
the O
we O
need O
the O
time O
just O
to O
kind O
of O
figure O
out O
where O
our O
relationship O
is O
before O

mhm O
. O

I O
said O
it O
's O
not O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
meet O
your O
family O

it O
's O
just O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
I O
-- O
That O
's O
a O
lot O
at O
once O
. O
I O
know O
his O
mom O
too O

and O
I O
think O
she O
's O
a O
little O
bit O
leery O
of O
this O
whole O
relationship O
based O
on O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
past O
you O
know O

mhm O
. O

and O
I O
hurt O
her O
son O
and O
all O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

I O
'm O
like O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
'm O
ready O
for O
that O

and O
so O
but O
it O
it O
wor- O
ended O
up O
happening O
that O
it O
was O
his O
brother O
's O
birthday O

and O
we O
were O
out O
there O
to O
go O
to O
the O
beach O

and O
so O
I O
'm O
like O
okay O
we O
can O
you O
know O
I O
can O
handle O
this O

and O
%uh O
it O
was O
very O
nice O
actually O

so O
Good O
. O
that O
was O
fine O

and O
%uh O

So O
where O
did O
things O
end O
up O
? O

oh O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
Vick B-PERSON
, O

%um O
it O
was O
really O
fun O

and O
I O
mean O
in O
some O
ways O
Joe B-PERSON
is O
somebody O
I O
've O
known O
a O
long O
time O
and O
and O
know O
pretty O
well O

but O
in O
other O
ways O
it O
's O
like O
this O
is O
a O
whole O
new O
relationship O

mhm O
. O

so O
it O
's O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
weird O
to O
walk O
that O
balance O
like O
well O
you O
know O
, O
one B-TIME
minute I-TIME
we O
're O
talking O
seriously O
like O
where O
would O
we O
live O
if O
we O
wanted O
to O
be O
together O
and O
the O
next O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
like O
Wow O
. O
wait O
a O
minute O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
this O

I O
mean O

What O
's O
he O
doing O
now O
? O

He O
's O
in O
his O
last O
year O
of O
graduate O
school O
at O
Columbia O
University O
. O

He O
's O
getting O
his O
Masters O
in O
Public O
Administration O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
he O
's O
been O
working O
with O
this O
man O
who O
's O
starting O
a O
no- O
a O
new O
nonprofit O
organization O

%um O

he O
worked O
with O
him O
last O
summer O
and O
this O
summer O
and O
probably O
will O
work O
with O
during O
the O
school O
year O
. O

Beyond O
that O
I O
do O
n't O
he O
does O
n't O
know O
what O
he O
's O
going O
to O
do O
you O
know O

but O
it O
's O
you O
know O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
hard O
because O
-- O
Kind O
of O
open O
but O
He O
might O
want O
I O
mean O
chances O
are O
really O
good O
that O
he O
'll O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
or O
at O
least O
on O
the O
east O
coast O
, O
you O
know O
? O

Right O
. O

Kind O
of O
interested O
in O
politics O

so O
D B-GPE
C I-GPE
would O
be O
an O
option O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

It O
's O
just O
hard O
because O
that O
's O
not O
really O
yeah O
where O
I O
'm O
at O

but O
I O
mean O
we O
're O
both O
sort O
of O
like O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
life O
is O
taking O
us O

and O

Hard O
to O
start O
a O
relationship O
when O
that O

yeah O
, O

so O
what O
do O
we O
do O

you O
know O
do O
we O
make O
decisions O
based O
on O
each O
other O

I O
mean O
this O
was O
just O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
weekend O
we O
saw O
we O
've O
seen O
each O
other O

so O
he O
's O
coming O
here O
over O
Labor B-EVENT
Day I-EVENT
weekend O
-- O

mhm O
. O

and O

because O
my O

I O
am O

go O
go O
there O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
weekend I-DATE
of I-DATE
October I-DATE
. O

That O
was O
kind O
of O
hard O
for O
us O
to O
decide O

you O
know O
he O
has O
n't O
even O
been O
here O
yet O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
seen O

Fourth B-DATE
of I-DATE
July I-DATE
weekend O

and O
and O
we O
decided O
well O

it O
is O
final O
, O
and O
going O
into O
the O
streets O
, O
it O
has O
become O
a O
matter O
of O
hours O
, O
as O
one O
official O
in O
Hezbollah B-ORG
said O
. O

Actions O
are O
about O
to O
happen O
, O
they O
are O
actually O
imminent O
, O
after O
all O
preparations O
for O
them O
have O
been O
finalized O
, O
as O
stated O
by O
Ali B-PERSON
Qanso I-PERSON
, O
leader O
of O
the B-ORG
Syrian I-ORG
Social I-ORG
National I-ORG
Party I-ORG
. O

In O
principle O
also O
, O
all O
the O
political O
mediations O
which O
were O
widely O
talked O
about O
yesterday B-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
were O
voided O
by O
nighttime B-TIME
, O
because O
the O
calculations O
of O
the O
minority O
or O
the O
opposition O
do O
not O
correspond O
at O
all O
with O
those O
of O
the O
majority O
or O
the O
loyalists O
. O

We O
are O
then O
at O
the O
threshold O
of O
street O
action O
, O
and O
this O
is O
what O
compelled O
the O
vice O
president O
of O
the B-ORG
Higher I-ORG
Shiite I-ORG
Council I-ORG
, O
Abdel B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Amir I-PERSON
Qabalan I-PERSON
to O
warn O
from O
going O
into O
the O
streets O
because O
there O
is O
harm O
and O
corruption O
in O
this O
action O
. O

This O
is O
also O
what O
drove O
President O
Fuad B-PERSON
Siniora I-PERSON
to O
warn O
about O
the O
prevalence O
of O
the O
overthrow O
logic O
over O
democratic O
logic O
. O

This O
also O
drove O
the O
Member O
of O
Parliament O
Saad B-PERSON
Hariri I-PERSON
to O
warn O
of O
the O
continuing O
series O
of O
assassinations O
, O
considering O
that O
the O
turn O
now O
is O
focused O
on O
two B-CARDINAL
: O
Walid B-PERSON
Jumblatt I-PERSON
, O
and O
himself O
personally O
. O

So O
here O
we O
are O
again O
in O
the O
phase O
of O
awaiting O
the O
winds O
of O
the O
storm O
. O

When O
will O
this O
storm O
blow O
, O
how O
, O
and O
where O
? O

and O
will O
it O
succeed O
as O
planned O
or O
as O
its O
executors O
plan O
, O
in O
rooting O
out O
the O
government O
of O
President O
Siniora B-PERSON
, O
or O
introducing O
the O
blocking O
third B-ORDINAL

Or O
will O
this O
storm O
fail O
to O
change O
any O
of O
the O
conditions O
as O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O

maintain O
? O

And O
in O
this O

what O
about O
the O
fate O
of O
the B-ORG
International I-ORG

, O
and O
the O

Then O
again O
, O
what O
about O
the O
fate O
of O
resolution B-LAW

, O
which O
it O
appears O
that O
everyone O

forgotten O

For O

After O

Vietnam B-GPE

And O
the O
other O
is O

Has O

Is O
it O

, O
they O
hope O
to O
find O
out O
who O
the O
father O
is O
once O
she O
gives O

because O
they O
will O
analyze O

It O

that O

more O

As O

not O
the O

no O

to O

one B-CARDINAL

: O

Housing O

Creating O

a O

creating O
a O

is O
an O

the O

The O
problem O
, O
I O
surmise O
-- O
it O

not O
discussed O
in O

-- O
is O
that O

about O

which O
means O
replacing O
the O
vacated O

, O
not O
housing O

It O
's O
hard O
to O
fault O
Arlington B-GPE

pursuing O
its O
short O
- O
term O
self O
interest O

But O
everyone O
needs O
to O
recognize O
that O
Arlington B-GPE

decision O
not O
to O
pursue O
a O
balanced O
community O
means O
that O
housing O
will O
end O
up O
somewhere O
else O
, O
presumably O
in O
outlying O
counties O
. O

the O

Right O

Did O
n't O
I O
read O
somewhere O
that O
some O
of O
those O
office O
buildings O
were O
considered O
worn O
out O
and O
that O
they O
would O
be O
demolished O
and O
replaced O
rather O
than O
refurbished O
? O

Would O
that O
be O
an O
opportunity O
for O
more O
mixed O
use O
? O

Is O
it O
an O
example O
of O
`` O
existing O
infrastructure O
'' O
that O
is O
worn O
out O
and O
outlived O
its O
usefuleness O
? O

Jim B-PERSON
, O
minor O
point O
- O

unlike O
most O
other O
Virginia B-GPE
counties O
, O
Arlington B-GPE
County I-GPE
does O
not O
have O
a B-ORG
Board I-ORG
of I-ORG
Supervisors I-ORG
. O

It O
does O
have O
a B-ORG
County I-ORG
Board I-ORG
. O

Members O
of O
the B-ORG
Arlington I-ORG
County I-ORG
Board I-ORG
are O
addressed O
not O
as O
supervisors O
, O
but O
as O
Board O
Members O
. O

If O
Arlington B-GPE
has O
sufficient O
public O
infrastructure O
to O
support O
housing O
at O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
adding O
housing O
to O
that O
area O
would O
be O
an O
excellent O
idea O
. O

The O
question O
that O
the O
Arlington B-GPE
community O
needs O
to O
answer O
is O
: O
Whether O
the O
supporting O
infrastructure O
is O
sufficient O
? O

If O
not O
, O
what O
is O
the O
incentive O
for O
Arlingtonians B-NORP
to O
dig O
deeper O
in O
their O
pockets O
to O
pay O
for O
public O
infrastructure O
so O
that O
the O
housing O
does O
not O
get O
constructed O
in O
outlying O
counties O
? O

The O
funds O
run O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
from O
Arlington B-GPE
, O
just O
as O
they O
do O
from O
Fairfax B-GPE
-- O
down O
to O
Richmond B-GPE
and O
then O
around O
the O
state O
. O

Moreover O
, O
while O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
many O
people O
would O
enjoy O
the O
urban O
life O
of O
a O
newly O
revitalized O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
many O
others O
would O
not O
. O

Many O
people O
simply O
want O
to O
live O
in O
single O
family O
, O
detached O
homes O
that O
will O
not O
be O
available O
in O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
. O

Further O
, O
any O
housing O
built O
in O
that O
area O
will O
likey O
be O
quite O
costly O
given O
the O
price O
of O
land O
and O
the O
costs O
to O
construct O
high O
- O
rise O
buildings O
. O

Ray B-PERSON
Hyde I-PERSON
has O
persuaded O
me O
that O
we O
need O
to O
provide O
incentives O
for O
good O
quality O
, O
higher O
paying O
jobs O
to O
locate O
in O
outlying O
areas O
. O

There O
probably O
are O
n't O
enough O
tax O
dollars O
-- O
even O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
John B-PERSON
Chichester I-PERSON
-- O
to O
fix O
NoVA B-LOC
's O
transportation O
and O
other O
infrastructure O
problems O
that O
are O
, O
in O
large O
part O
, O
based O
on O
the O
high O
concentration O
of O
good O
- O
paying O
jobs O
here O
, O
along O
with O
a O
lack O
of O
both O
affordable O
housing O
. O

Unless O
builders O
are O
going O
to O
supply O
affordable O
housing O
at O
a O
loss O
-- O
which O
, O
to O
me O
, O
seems O
absurd O
, O
there O
wo O
n't O
be O
affordable O
housing O
here O
without O
even O
more O
tax O
subsidies O
. O

-LRB- O
Of O
course O
, O
every O
tax O
dollar O
spent O
on O
subsidizing O
housing O
is O
n't O
available O
for O
other O
purposes O
. O
-RRB- O

That O
suggests O
sprawl O
will O
continue O
, O
as O
will O
the O
demand O
for O
more O
and O
more O
roads O
and O
other O
infrastructure O
. O

Virginia B-GPE
needs O
balanced O
job O
growth O
. O

In O
theory O
, O
the O
loss O
of O
these O
jobs O
presents O
an O
opportunity O
to O
do O
something O
different O
in O
terms O
of O
settlement O
patterns O
. O

Perhaps O
to O
replace O
commercial O
businesses O
with O
housing O
and O
/ O
or O
more O
balanced O
mixed O
- O
use O
. O

Lots O
of O
questions O
here O
but O
I O
do O
agree O
.. O
just O
the O
potential O
concept O
is O
provocative O
... O

But O
, O
what O
would O
be O
the O
benefit O
to O
Arlington B-GPE
to O
do O
this O
? O

More O
specifically O
- O
what O
would O
be O
the O
benefit O
to O
those O
who O
already O
live O
and O
pay O
taxes O
in O
Arlington B-GPE
? O

What O
would O
Arlington B-GPE
have O
to O
provide O
in O
the O
way O
of O
additional O
infrastructure O
? O

-LRB- O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
I O
would O
agree O
that O
more O
infrastructure O
would O
be O
needed O
for O
residential O
vs O
commercial O
but O
let O
's O
explore O
it O
. O

It O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
that O
if O
you O
took O
an O
office O
building O
in O
Crystal B-LOC
and O
converted O
it O
to O
apartments O
.. O
you O
'd O
not O
have O
any O
more O
people O
-LRB- O
perhaps O
less O
-RRB- O
so O
you O
would O
n't O
need O
any O
more O
water O
/ O
sewer O
capacity O
... O
and O
ditto O
for O
parking O
places O
... O
at O
least O
it O
would O
seem O
so O
-RRB- O
. O

Ditto O
with O
commuting O
... O

instead O
of O
a O
hoard O
of O
folks O
`` O
in O
commuting O
'' O
from O
outer O
jurisdictions O
to O
Arlington B-GPE
every O
morning O
, O
would O
n't O
you O
have O
instead O
- O
more O
`` O
out O
'' O
commuting O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
folks O
who O
actually O
own O
the O
land O
- O
would O
they O
agree O
to O
a O
change O
in O
the O
zoning O
from O
Office O
Commercial O
to O
Apartment O
Residential O
? O

What O
would O
be O
the O
economics O
of O
this O
with O
respect O
to O
those O
who O
hold O
those O
properties O
as O
investments O
? O

It O
would O
seem O
- O
that O
Arlington B-GPE
and O
the O
other O
area O
jurisdictions O
have O
already O
had O
such O
a O
choice O
for O
years B-DATE
- O
and O
that O
they O
chose O
commercial O
development O
over O
residential O
- O
in O
effect O
- O
letting O
more O
remote O
jurisdictions O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
provide O
residential O
for O
folks O
who O
wanted O
to O
work O
in O
NoVa B-LOC
and O
commute O
to O
the O
outer O
suburbs O
to O
live O
. O

To O
a O
certain O
extent O
- O
one O
could O
say O
that O
No B-LOC
Va I-LOC
jurisdictions O
have O
a O
responsibility O
to O
provide O
housing O
for O
those O
that O
work O
in O
the O
same O
area O
and O
NOT O
force O
workers O
to O
commute O
to O
outer O
jursidictions O
for O
housing O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
. O

In O
the O
end O
- O
every O
worker O
who O
, O
for O
whatever O
reason O
, O
ends O
up O
commuting O
... O
that O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
more O
person O
using O
the O
transportation O
network O
more O
intensively O
than O
those O
that O
live O
locally O
with O
shorter O
commutes O
. O

So O
.. O
here O
's O
a O
concluding O
thought O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
an O
exercise O
would O
it O
be O
for O
each O
NoVa B-LOC
jurisdiction O
to O
total O
up O
the O
number O
of O
jobs O
in O
its O
boundaries O
verses O
the O
amount O
of O
housing O
within O
its O
boundaries O
. O

Would O
we O
see O
a O
big O
disparity O
? O

I O
know O
where O
I O
live O
in O
the O
outer O
suburbs O
that O
there O
IS O
a O
big O
disparity O
in O
the O
opposite O
sense O
. O

We O
have O
far O
, O
far O
more O
people O
in O
homes O
than O
we O
have O
jobs O
for O
them O
. O

In O
other O
words O
a O
huge O
percent O
of O
our O
population O
are O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
NoVa B-LOC
commuters O
. O

With O
respect O
to O
the O
jobs O
/ O
housing O
question O
- O
I O
wonder O
what O
the O
totals O
would O
be O
for O
the O
entire O
NoVa B-LOC
area O
- O
all O
jursidictions O
with O
respect O
to O
jobs O
verses O
housing O
. O

From O
an O
equity O
perspective O
- O
should O
jurisdictions O
provide O
as O
much O
housing O
as O
they O
have O
jobs O
? O

The O
mechanism O
for O
doing O
this O
would O
be O
zoning O
- O

a O
certain O
percentage O
of O
areas O
would O
be O
reserved O
ONLY O
for O
residential O
development O
or O
areas O
designated O
for O
mixed O
use O
development O
would O
have O
a O
hard O
percentage O
cap O
on O
how O
much O
residential O
had O
to O
be O
part O
of O
the O
mixed O
- O
used O
proposal O
. O

Or O
to O
turn O
this O
completely O
around O
- O
would O
folks O
support O
the O
right O
of O
any O
jurisdiction O
to O
zone O
entirely O
that O
jurisdiction O
for O
commercial O
/ O
industrial O
ONLY O
and O
let O
outlying O
jurisdictions O
provide O
residential O
? O

In O
some O
respects O
, O
is O
n't O
that O
essentially O
what O
No B-LOC
Va I-LOC
jursidictions O
are O
doing O
- O
favoring O
non-residential O
development O
and O
letting O
other O
jursidictions O
handle O
the O
residential O
? O

Turning O
this O
on O
its O
head O
- O
what O
is O
the O
incentive O
for O
a O
worker O
in O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
to O
buy O
there O
? O

Most O
jobs O
now O
do O
n't O
last O
for O
decades B-DATE
- O
no O
one O
expects O
a O
career O
at O
a O
company O
any O
more O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
buy O
a O
house O
for O
one B-DATE
specific O
job O
- O

but O
if O
I O
bought O
at O
Crystal B-LOC
City I-LOC
, O
I O
'd O
be O
locked O
in O
to O
that O
area O
. O

What O
happens O
if O
my O
next O
job O
is O
in O
Silver B-GPE
Spring I-GPE
, O
or O
Leesburg B-GPE
, O
or O
Quantico B-GPE
? O

Am O
I O
supposed O
to O
buy O
and O
sell O
my O
house O
each O
time O
I O
change O
jobs O
? O

I O
've O
been O
through O
six B-CARDINAL
-LRB- O
high O
tech O
-RRB- O
jobs O
in O
the O
past O
14 B-DATE
years I-DATE
- O
all O
while O
living O
at O
the O
same O
house O
, O
all O
good O
jobs O
and O
good O

moves O
. O

If O
I O
changed O
houses O
like O
the O
tech O
field O
requires O
you O
to O
change O
jobs O
, O
I O
'd O
spend O
my O
entire O
life O
packing O
and O
unpacking O
. O

Living O
where O
you O
work O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
those O
`` O
nice O

of O

you O

a O

and O
no O

can O
afford O
to O
move O
to O
a O
new O
house O
every O
time O
they O
get O
a O
new O
job O
. O

That O
's O
why O
people O
pay O
a O
premium O
to O
live O
in O
a O
central O
location O
-- O

it O
gives O
them O
proximity O

Larry B-PERSON
, O
This O
is O
my O
personal O
conviction O
: O

If O
local O
governments O
were O
not O
given O
the O
power O
to O
restrict O
housing O
development O
through O
zoning O
, O
a O
free O
market O
would O
provide O
a O
much O
better O
balance O
of O
housing O
/ O
jobs O
/ O
retail O
/ O
amenities O
than O
what O
we O
have O
now O
. O

The O
answer O
is O
less O
regulation O
, O
not O
more O
. O

Jim B-PERSON
: O
I O
believe O
in O
free O
markets O
as O
well O
, O
but O
I O
also O
hold O
that O
free O
markets O
are O
equally O
as O
free O
of O
economic O
subsidies O
as O
well O
as O
over O
- O
burdensome O
regulation O
. O

What O
is O
the O
argument O
that O
letting O
people O
develop O
their O
property O
as O
desired O
without O
regard O
to O
the O
impact O
on O
existing O
residents O
and O
businesses O
is O
a O
free O
market O
? O

None O
of O
us O
would O
likely O
support O
the O
abolishment O
of O
all O
zoning O
as O
is O
basically O
the O
case O
in O
Houston B-GPE
. O

Would O
we O
find O
it O
acceptable O
to O
allow O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
foundary O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
residential O
neighborhood O
? O

What O
about O
building O
a O
30 B-CARDINAL
- O
story O
building O
in O
the O
flight O
path O
of O
Dulles B-FAC
Airport I-FAC
? O

Few O
of O
us O
would O
likely O
support O
that O
. O

We O
have O
a O
serious O
problem O
with O
public O
infrastructure O
in O
areas O
of O
Virginia B-GPE
. O

Few O
dispute O
that O
. O

What O
we O
argue O
over O
is O
who O
is O
responsible O
to O
fund O
the O
necessary O
infrastructure O
; O
to O
what O
amount O
; O
and O
should O
people O
be O
permitted O
to O
build O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
adequate O
public O
facilities O
. O

Reasonable O
people O
can O
answer O
these O
questions O
differently O
. O

But O
, O
at O
some O
point O
, O
there O
is O
a O
question O
of O
basic O
equity O
that O
must O
be O
answered O
: O

How O
much O
`` O
cost O
'' O
should O
society O
be O
able O
to O
impose O
on O
an O
existing O
resident O
/ O
business O
so O
that O
someone O
else O
can O
use O
his O
or O
her O
property O
as O
they O
desire O
? O

Since O
we O
would O
n't O
permit O
the O
foundary O
to O
built O
in O
the O
residential O
neighborhood O
, O
we O
all O
effectively O
agree O
that O
there O
are O
limits O
to O
how O
much O
cost O
we O
are O
willing O
to O
impose O
on O
existing O
residents O
. O

Stated O
alternatively O
, O
one O
does O
not O
have O
an O
absolute O
right O
to O
use O
his O
/ O
her O
property O
as O
desired O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
question O
we O
might O
ask O
is O
: O
Who O
is O
the O
cost O
- O
causer O
? O

The O
answer O
is O
always O
going O
to O
be O
`` O
the O
newcomer O
. O
'' O

One O
might O
also O
ask O
: O
At O
what O
point O
does O
it O
become O
unfair O
to O
load O
all O
of O
the O
costs O
on O
the O
newcomer O
? O

Few O
would O
likely O
argue O
that O
, O
because O
of O
the O
high O
forward O
- O
looking O
costs O
for O
constructing O
infrastructure O
, O
we O
should O
not O
permit O
any O
building O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
without O
the O
upfront O
payment O
of O
the O
total O
costs O
for O
constructing O
infrastructure O
. O

That O
would O
be O
unfair O
. O

But O
, O
at O
the O
very O
same O
time O
, O
is O
n't O
equally O
unfair O
to O
load O
all O
of O
the O
infrastructure O
costs O
on O
taxpayers O
-- O
especially O
given O
Virginia B-GPE
's O
tax O
structure O
that O
takes O
much O
from O
NoVA B-LOC
and O
gives O
little O
back O
? O

One O
might O
be O
able O
to O
make O
a O
good O
argument O
that O
we O
could O
save O
transportation O
costs O
by O
building O
densely O
in O
NoVA B-LOC
. O

But O
what O
about O
the O
other O
infrastructure O
costs O
that O
are O
then O
imposed O
on O
residents O
of O
NoVA B-LOC
? O

What O
's O
in O
it O
for O
us O
? O

talking O
about O
spending O
billions B-CARDINAL
of O
scarce O
tax O
dollars O
extending O
Metrorail B-FAC
when O
it O
is O
n't O
going O

BTW O
, O
check O
out O
the O
other O
story O
in O

Post B-ORG

about O
Fairfax B-GPE
County O
Supervisor O
Gerald B-PERSON
Hyland I-PERSON
's O
involvement O
with O

's O
attempt O
to O

What O
else O
goes O
on O
between O
segments O
of O
the O
business O
community O
and O
the O
supervisors O
? O

re O
: O
WaPo B-ORG
article O
. O

yes O
, O
agree O
it O
was O
excellent O
in O
describing O
the O
issues O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
perplexed O
... O
as O
usual O
... O

`` O
because O
employers O
' O
first B-ORDINAL
priority O
is O
being O
near O
a O
qualified O
workforce O
, O
and O
residents O
continue O
to O
seek O
affordable O
, O
spacious O
homes O
and O
good O
schools O
in O
more O
distant O
communities O
. O
'' O

I O
found O
this O
rather O
odd O
in O
that O
the O
concept O
of O
`` O
near O
'' O
is O
apparently O
perceived O
differently O
depending O
on O
whether O
you O
were O
an O
employer O
or O
an O
employee O
. O

employers O
want O
to O
be O
`` O
near O
'' O
a O
qualified O
workforce O
but O
employees O
-LRB- O
note O
they O
use O
the O
word O
residents O
-RRB- O
continue O
to O
seek O
... O
homes O
in O
more O
distant O
communities O
. O

Unless O
I O
'm O
not O
reading O
it O
properly O
... O
it O
sounds O
like O
the O
employers O
' O
concept O
of O
`` O
near O
'' O
is O
a O
very O
different O
concept O
than O
the O
employee O
's O
concept O
of O
a O
`` O
near O
'' O
place O
to O
live O
. O

Would O
n't O
one O
presume O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
concepts O
be O
the O
same O
... O
that O
the O
employee O
would O
want O
to O
be O
near O
where O
a O
qualified O
workforce O
lives O
... O
AND O
vice O
versa O
? O

Also O
... O
discussed O
in O
BLOG O
was O
the O
idea O
that O
folks O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
move O
everytime O
they O
change O
jobs O
which O
is O
an O
excellent O
point O
but O
how O
does O
that O
explain O
folks O
who O
move O
to O
the O
outer O
burbs O
... O
and O
then O
change O
jobs O
that O
requires O
even O
a O
longer O
commute O
? O

Are O
n't O
people O
who O
move O
to O
the O
outer O
burbs O
... O
for O
housing O
.. O
locking O
themselves O
in O
to O
a O
less O
flexible O
situation O
the O
same O
way O
that O
someone O
would O
in O
trying O
to O
live O
next O
door O
to O
where O
they O
work O
because O
in O
both O
cases O
.. O
if O
they O
change O
jobs O
- O
they O
've O
probably O
bought O
themselves O
a O
longer O
commute O
. O

Is O
n't O
it O
curious O
the O
employers O
want O
to O
be O
near O
a O
qualified O
work O
force O
? O

Would O
n't O
that O
result O
in O
less O
travel O
rather O
than O
more O
? O

The O
other O
comment O
of O
interest O
was O
that O
most O
residents O
of O
mixed O
use O
communities O
do O
n't O
find O
employment O
there O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
that O
some O
mixed O
use O
residents O
do O
find O
local O
employment O
that O
suits O
their O
skills O
, O
that O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
and O
it O
will O
marginally O
reduce O
travel O
. O

But O
we O
should O
not O
count O
on O
it O
as O
a O
panacea O
, O
and O
it O
does O
not O
conflict O
with O
the O
idea O
that O
we O
need O
more O
places O
. O

`` O
Mixed O
use O
'' O
and O
`` O
more O
places O
'' O
are O
compatible O
ideas O
. O

The O
article O
should O
put O
to O
rest O
the O
argument O
that O
Ed B-PERSON
Risse I-PERSON
and O
I O
have O
had O
about O
job O
growth O
. O

His O
previous O
statement O
was O
that O
while O
the O
percet O
job O
growth O
in O
PW B-GPE
was O
high O
the O
absolute O
number O
was O
small O
. O

Today O
we O
see O
that O
the O
absolute O
numbers O
are O
also O
higher O
. O

If O
we O
choose O
to O
have O
a O
successful O
transportation O
plan O
then O
we O
should O
design O
the O
plan O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
which O
will O
occur O
as O
a O
result O
of O
what O
is O
happening O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
what O
we O
wish O
would O
happen O
. O

Otherwise O
you O
have O
to O
design O
not O
only O
a O
transportation O
plan O
but O
a O
way O
to O
change O
everyone O
's O
decisions O
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O

Today O
's O
article O
shows O
how O
difficult O
that O
is O
, O
so O
why O
choose O
a O
plan O
that O
is O
bound O
to O
fail O
? O

Metro B-FAC
will O
not O
ease O
congestion O
and O
it O
has O
n't O
done O
so O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
thirty I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

What O
it O
does O
do O
is O
allow O
more O
people O
to O
travel O
to O
some O
places O
than O
can O
be O
acommodated O
by O
highways O
. O

It O
does O
that O
by O
offering O
a O
lower O
level O
of O
service O
and O
less O
comfort O
-LRB- O
standing O
room O
only O
-RRB- O
. O

It O
might O
be O
that O
there O
is O
still O
sufficient O
reason O
to O
spend O
billions B-MONEY
of I-MONEY
scarce I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
on O
Metro O
, O
but O
easing O
traffic O
congestion O
is O
n't O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O

We O
should O
evaluate O
the O
expenditure O
for O
what O
it O
does O
do O
and O
who O
benefits O
and O
assign O
the O
costs O
accordingly O
, O
if O
the O
expenditure O
is O
still O
reasonable O
. O

Clearly O
, O
that O
does O
not O
include O
billing O
the O
tollroad O
users O
for O
Metro B-FAC
construction O
. O

Making O
Route B-FAC
7 I-FAC
sixteen B-CARDINAL
lanes O
is O
probably O
just O
as O
bad O
an O
idea O
as O
Metro B-FAC
. O

That O
is O
just O
another O
plan O
to O
take O
everyone O
to O
the O
same O
place O
, O
which O
we O
know O
will O
fail O
. O

The O
difference O
is O
that O
those O
who O
use O
that O
route O
will O
have O
individually O
controlled O
climate O
, O
music O
, O
and O
seats O
. O

And O
they O
can O
eat O
or O
smoke O
if O
they O
choose O
. O

Aside O
from O
Gerald B-PERSON
Gordon I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
comments O
, O
you O
have O
Jay B-PERSON
Fissette I-PERSON
saying O
that O
we O
have O
not O
fully O
made O
the O
connection O
between O
land O
use O
and O
transportation O
. O

I O
'd O
say O
that O
most O
people O
have O
made O
the O
connection O
and O
that O
the O
one O
Jay B-PERSON
is O
proposing O
is O
just O
wrong O
. O

Then O
, O
of O
course O
, O
there O
is O
the O
apparently O
obligatory O
and O
generally O
clueless O
comment O
by O
Stewart B-PERSON
Schwartz I-PERSON
that O
such O
articles O
always O
seem O
to O
include O
. O

In O
this O
case O
he O
makes O
the O
completely O
unsupported O
and O
obviously O
wrong O
statement O
that O
the O
conditions O
cited O
in O
the O
article O
leave O
everybody O
worse O
off O
. O

If O
he O
wants O
to O
voice O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
wrong O
people O
are O
making O
money O
in O
the O
wrong O
places O
, O
that O
's O
different O
; O

but O
the O
claim O
that O
everybody O
is O
worse O
off O
is O
patently O
false O
and O
weakens O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
arguments O
accordingly O
. O

As O
for O
conservation O
easements O
, O
do O
n't O
get O
me O
started O
. O

When O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
organizations O
are O
founded O
to O
accept O
gifts O
from O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
people O
, O
then O
stories O
like O
Hyland B-PERSON
's O
are O
inevitable O
. O

If O
conservationists O
want O
to O
conserve O
land O
, O
then O
they O
need O
to O
raise O
the O
money O
and O
go O
buy O
it O
. O

That O
means O
that O
they O
will O
need O
to O
set O
priorities O
as O
to O
what O
land O
is O
most O
worth O
saving O
and O
give O
up O
on O
the O
idea O
of O
saving O
95 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
it O
, O
for O
free O
. O

Or O
, O
we O
can O
come O
up O
with O
some O
method O
of O
providing O
continuing O
income O
to O
those O
that O
are O
already O
conserving O
the O
land O
. O

A O
one B-CARDINAL
shot O
, O
partial O
payment O
in O
the O
form O
a O
conservation O
easement O
can O
not O
possibly O
conserve O
the O
land O
forever O
. O

Even O
when O
land O
is O
publicly O
owned O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
count O
on O
conservation O
continuing O
. O

Maryland B-GPE
has O
proposed O
selling O
land O
to O
raise O
money O
, O
Fairfax B-GPE
to O
support O
affordable O
housing O
, O
and O
The B-ORG
Vint I-ORG
Hill I-ORG
Economic I-ORG

Authority I-ORG
is O
arguably O
the O
largest O

in O
Fauquier B-GPE
. O

In O
a O
situation O
where O
the O
public O
c O
n't O
afford O
to O
keep O
their O
lands O
clear O
, O
what O
chance O
is O
there O
for O
the O
private O
individual O
? O

re O
: O
infrastructure O
costs O
and O
newcomers O

all O
things O
being O
equal O
.. O
a O
newcomer O
in O
NoVa B-LOC
needs O
infrastructure O
to O
support O
them O
in O
not O
very O
different O
ways O
that O
- O
that O
same O
newcomer O
in O
the O
outer O
burbs O
would O
need O
similar O
infrastructure O
- O

and O
it O
IS O
the O
infrastructure O
costs O
that O
are O
much O
more O
at O
issue O
than O
density O
per O
se O
because O
discussions O
of O
density O
.. O
seem O
to O
always O
flow O
back O
to O
infrastructure O
and O
not O
focus O
on O
density O
itself O
as O
a O
good O
or O
bad O
thing O
. O

If O
a O
newcomer O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
money O
to O
have O
a O
garage O
on O
their O
new O
house O
- O
people O
would O
be O
up O
in O
arms O
if O
their O
property O
taxes O
were O
taken O
to O
pay O
for O
that O
new O
garage O

but O
apparently O
folks O
' O
views O
of O
this O
become O
less O
clear O
if O
we O
're O
talking O
about O
taking O
people O
's O
money O
to O
pay O
for O
.. O
say O
a O
new O
classroom O
.. O
or O
a O
new O
library O
or O
fire O
station O
or O
traffic O
light O
or O
widened O
roadways O
. O

I O
think O
property O
owners O
are O
willing O
for O
the O
most O
part O
to O
pay O
their O
fair O
share O
- O

but O
if O
the O
growth O
rate O
is O
high O
- O
where O
there O
is O
a O
huge O
influx O
of O
newcomers O
then O
we O
have O
significant O
money O
issues O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
our O
locality O
has O
to O
build O
a O
new O
school O
every O
year O
and O
I O
understand O
that O
Loudoun B-GPE
has O
to O
build O
several O
new O
schools O
every O
year O
. O

Schools O
are O
over O
70 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
our O
property O
taxes O
. O

Without O
proffers O
- O
our O
taxes O
would O
have O
easily O
doubled O
and O
then O
some O
not O
to O
mention O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
the O
elected O
officials O
who O
approved O
those O
tax O
increases O
. O

Everyone O
needs O
a O
place O
to O
live O

but O
I O
will O
point O
out O
that O
when O
a O
newcomer O
buys O
a O
home O
twice O
and O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
as O
big O
as O
the O
typical O
house O
in O
the O
outer O
burbs O
.. O
commutes O
solo O
in O
a O
-LRB- O
usually O
new O
-RRB- O
SUV O
50 B-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
a O
day O
and O
then O
expects O
folks O
of O
much O
more O
modest O
means O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
infrastructure O
tab O
.. O
that O
there O
will O
be O
complaints O
. O

`` O
Another O
way O
of O
looking O
at O
this O
is O
that O
if O
new O
folks O
had O
to O
pay O
their O
actual O
share O
of O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
there O
would O
be O
less O
money O
for O
bigger O
homes O
and O
new O
SUV O
and O
long O
solo O
commutes O
. O
'' O

And O
when O
we O
have O
all O
taxpayers O
picking O
up O
the O
tab O
for O
these O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
there O
is O
no O
incentive O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
new O
folks O
- O
to O
make O
conservative O
financial O
decisions O
- O

because O
, O
in O
essence O
, O
they O
are O
being O
subsididzed O
. O

The O
more O
that O
each O
person O
has O
to O
pay O
their O
own O
fair O
share O
of O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
the O
more O
it O
will O
impact O
the O
choices O
that O
have O
expensive O
consequences O
- O
for O
either O
them O
.. O
or O
for O
others O
. O

I O
pointed O
out O
in O
another O
post O
the O
problems O
of O
planned O
communities O
. O

There O
, O
the O
existing O
residents O
have O
not O
paid O
enough O
to O
support O
the O
common O
use O
land O
and O
common O
use O
infrastructure O
, O
with O
the O
result O
that O
these O
communities O
are O
now O
resorting O
to O
assessing O
additional O
fees O
, O
but O
only O
on O
newcomers O
. O

In O
this O
case O
the O
newcomers O
are O
not O
causing O
any O
new O
requirements O
, O

but O
they O
are O
still O
being O
expected O
to O
pay O
a O
higher O
price O
than O
existing O
residents O
, O
and O
for O
facilites O
that O
were O
worn O
out O
-LRB- O
by O
existing O
residents O
-RRB- O
before O
the O
new O
residents O
arrived O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
this O
exposes O
a O
critical O
weakness O
in O
what O
we O
psychologically O
view O
as O
fair O
. O

I O
would O
agree O
with O
Larry B-PERSON
if O
: O
a O
-RRB- O
existing O
residents O
were O
already O
paying O
enough O
to O
support O
existing O
infrastructure O
, O
which O
they O
are O
apparently O
not O
. O

-LRB- O
At O
least O
that O
is O
a O
widely O
held O
belief O
. O
-RRB- O

b O
-RRB- O
the O
additional O
costs O
-LRB- O
for O
proffers O
and O
such O
-RRB- O
over O
and O
above O
ordinary O
and O
sufficient O
property O
taxes O
were O
carefully O
examined O
to O
cover O
only O
the O
new O
and O
extraordinary O
capital O
costs O
associated O
solely O
with O
new O
residents O
. O

That O
means O
that O
you O
can O
not O
blame O
the O
new O
residents O
for O
increased O
capital O
costs O
that O
are O
really O
in O
support O
of O
new O
desires O
or O
needs O
on O
the O
part O
of O
all O
residents O
. O

Say O
crime O
is O
up O
50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
so O
you O
need O
a O
new O
jail O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
new O
residents O
are O
planned O
to O
be O
up O
25 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

How O
much O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
new O
jail O
should O
the O
new O
residents O
pay O
? O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
hold O
them O
responsible O
for O
the B-PERCENT
50 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
increased O
need O
that O
is O
due O
to O
existing O
residents O
? O

I O
understand O
Larry B-PERSON
's O
point O
, O

but O
I O
think O
it O
is O
intellectually O
too O
easy O
to O
be O
correct O
. O

I O
particularly O
like O
this O
: O
Another O
way O
of O
looking O
at O
this O
is O
that O
if O
new O
folks O
had O
to O
pay O
their O
actual O
share O
of O
infrastructure O
costs O
- O
there O
would O
be O
less O
money O
for O
bigger O
homes O
and O
new O
SUV O
and O
long O
solo O
commutes O
. O

That O
is O
absolutely O
correct O
, O

and O
it O
corresponds O
to O
EMR B-PERSON
's O
gloomy O
prediction O
that O
we O
will O
all O
face O
lowered O
expectations O
. O

But O
what O
if O
the O
choice O
is O
a O
smaller O
home O
in O
the O
exurbs O
and O
a O
hybrid O
? O

It O
is O
a O
fine O
argument O
, O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
know O
anywhere O
near O
enough O
to O
actually O
and O
fairly O

This O
has O
already O
happened O
with O

They O
provided O

may O

but O
to O
make O
way O
for O
difference O
of O
opinion O
. O

re O
: O
newcomers O
/ O
infrastructure O
/ O
longevity O

Well O
.. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
infrastructure O
`` O
wears O
out O
'' O
in O
the O
usual O
sense O
but O
I O
do O
accept O
the O
premise O
for O
some O
things O
. O

Roads O
and O
water O
/ O
sewer O
are O
not O
replaced O
. O

They O
are O
, O
instead O
, O
maintained O
. O

Schools O
and O
Prisons O
and O
other O
buildings O
can O
eventually O
wear O
out O
and O
need O
replacement O
. O

But O
I O
am O
talking O
about O
new O
infrastructure O
that O
would O
not O
be O
needed O
if O
an O
area O
was O
not O
experiencing O
growth O
. O

All O
communities O
have O
CIPs O
-LRB- O
capital O
investment O
plans O
-RRB- O
for O
infrastructure O
- O
both O
replacement O
and O
but O
replacement O
infrastructure O
IS O
something O
that O
can O
be O
accomodated O
in O
an O
annual O
budget O
- O
much O
like O
figuring O
out O
how O
many O
buses O
the O
school O
system O
needs O
to O
replace O
- O
every O
year O
- O

it O
's O
a O
known O
calculation O
. O

But O
new O
infrastructure O
is O
not O
because O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
RATE O
of O
growth O

and O
I O
think O
there O
would O
be O
strenuous O
disagreement O
with O
the O
claim O
that O
`` O
That O
means O
that O
you O
can O
not O
blame O
the O
new O
residents O
for O
increased O
capital O
costs O
that O
are O
really O
in O
support O
of O
new O
desires O
or O
needs O
on O
the O
part O
of O
all O
residents O
. O
'' O

because O
existing O
residents O
are O
not O
getting O
`` O
better O
'' O
levels O
of O
services O
but O
rather O
expensive O
measures O
necessary O
to O
simply O
maintain O
their O
existing O
levels O
of O
service O
. O

Most O
communities O
would O
not O
willinging O
choose O
nor O
think O
fair O
that O
it O
is O
the O
existing O
residents O
' O
financial O
responsibility O
to O
pay O
for O
new O
infrastructure O
for O
new O
residents O
. O

it O
still O

wants O
to O

the O

an O

in O

, O
the O

uh O
, O
will O

both O

the O

said O

The O

clearly O

an O

It O
also O
would O
require O
the O

transportation O

to O
provide O
all O
information O

The O
bill O
would O
allow O

reject O
a O

out O
if O
sufficient O

in O
a O
substantial O

the O

please O
let O

just O

When O
they O
did O
that O

I O

I O
told O

in O
a O

of O
Milosevic B-PERSON

`` O

Yubitrich B-PERSON

one B-CARDINAL
of O

he O
owes O
it O

his O

Milosevic I-PERSON

Getting O
into O
Milosevic B-PERSON

even O
on O

was O
quite O
a O
temptation O
says O
Yubitrich B-PERSON

I O
always O
felt O
when O
I O
enter O

that O
I O

being O

something O
which O
I O
can O
compare O
to O

Currently O

the O

Under O

the O

People O

the O

At O

that O
's O
the O
conclusion O
you O
might O
reach O
from O
seeing O
the O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
journalists O
and O
photographers O
camped O
out O
there O
. O

They O
are O
all O

for O
the O

which O
is O
, O
as O

This O
amazing O

Garith B-PERSON
McClain I-PERSON
is O
covering O
the O

for O
the O
London B-GPE
based O
Guardian B-ORG
newspaper O
. O

Now O
Garith B-PERSON
it O
sounds O
like O
the O
Scottish B-NORP
media O
have O
all O
gone O
mad O
. O

Why O
this O
interest O
in O
an O
American B-NORP
pop O
star O
? O

We O
are O
surprised O
that O
we O
have O
such O
an O
American B-NORP
pop O
star O
in O
Scotland B-GPE
itself O
, O
never O
mind O
up O
in O
Dornoch B-GPE
which O
is O
near O
Inverness B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
the O
back O
of O
beyond O
even O
to O
most O
Scottish B-NORP
people O
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
like O
the O
wilds O
of O
Washington B-GPE
State I-GPE
. O

I O
think O
it O
's O
the O
best O
comparison O
I O
can O
make O
. O

So O
you O
are O
saying O
there O
are O
n't O
Hollywood B-GPE
stars O
and O
starlets O
there O
, O
there O
is O
not O
a O
whole O
lot O
going O
on O
. O

Just O
the O
howling O
wind O
and O
the O
pouring O
rain O
otherwise O
. O

And O
a O
lot O
of O
fog O
I O
guess O
now O
. O

Apparently O
, O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
good O
camera O
angle O
for O
the O
wedding O
. O

Apparently O
so O
, O
yes O
, O
and O
the O
guests O
have O
been O
warned O
not O
to O
keep O
cameras O
in O
their O
kilts O
. O

Cameras O
in O
their O
kilts O
? O

Yes O
. O

If O
one O
would O
so O
desire O
. O

Well O
apparently O
, O
photo O
lens O
in O
your O
pocket O
or O
are O
you O
just O
pleased O
to O
see O
me O
. O

Yes O
, O
guests O
have O
been O
warned O
not O
to O
bring O
in O
cameras O
in O
their O
kilts O
and O
people O
are O
having O
their O
kilts O
examined O
and O
looked O
up O
, O
which O
if O
you O
know O
anything O
about O
Scotland B-GPE
and O
Scottish B-NORP
men O
are O
n't O
suppose O
to O
wear O
anything O
under O
their O
kilts O
. O

Yeah O
. O

A O
bit O
of O
an O
eyeful O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
can O
. O

He O
's O
got O
a O
camera O
there O
! O

That O
's O
an O
interesting O
little O
anecdote O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

Well O
, O
when O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
happens O
in O
a O
small O
community O
and O
I O
guess O
that O
's O
a O
under O
statement O
in O
this O
case O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
it O
all O
succeeds O
depends O
on O
how O
well O
some O
of O
the O
local O
people O
can O
keep O
secrets O
. O

Are O
people O
kind O
of O
, O
you O
know O
, O
in O
the O
fold O
on O
this O
, O
or O
are O
there O
things O
being O
leaked O
around O
to O
press O
here O
and O
there O
? O

Well O
Skibo B-FAC
Castle I-FAC
, O
where O
the O
wedding O
is O
being O
held O
, O
is O
very O
discrete O
. O

There O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
celebrity O
weddings O
there O
but O
none O
as O
big O
as O
this O
admittedly O
. O

But O
within O
the O
town O
there O
was O
a O
piano O
being O
rented O
out O
from O
a O
piano O
shop O
in O
Aberdeen B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
sort O
of O
reasonably O
nearby O
and O
it O
was O
leaked O
that O
this O
was O
the O
piano O
that O
someone O
was O
going O
to O
play O
at O
the O
wedding O
. O

Reportedly O
, O
it O
was O
Elton B-PERSON
John I-PERSON
who O
was O
going O
to O
play O
a O
song O
for O
Guy B-PERSON
and O
the O
shop O
was O
inundated O
when O
this O
was O
leaked O
and O
people O
just O
wanting O
to O
touch O
the O
piano O
that O
was O
going O
to O
be O
in O
the O
same O
room O
as O
Madonna B-PERSON
and O
Guy B-PERSON
Ritchie I-PERSON
. O

I O
imagine O
the O
locals O
could O
be O
kind O
of O
swooning O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
because O
Sting B-PERSON
, O
who O
I O
guess O
might O
be O
singing O
at O
the O
wedding O
, O
his O
wife O
introduced O
the O
couple O
. O

Brad B-PERSON
Pitt I-PERSON
, O
Gwyneth B-PERSON
Paltrow I-PERSON
, O
Robin B-PERSON
Williams I-PERSON
, O
George B-PERSON
Clooney I-PERSON
, O
any O
other O
people O
around O
there O
are O
specially O
fond O
of O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
is O
the O
most O
unusual O
thing O
about O
it O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
have O
some O
friends O
who O
live O
up O
in O
there O
next O
to O
the O
woods O
and O
people O
are O
just O
surprised O
that O
they O
would O
choose O
this O
little O
tiny O
village O
in O
Scotland B-GPE
. O

It O
is O
the O
juxtaposition O
of O
that O
glamour O
, O
I O
mean O
a B-PERSON
Gwyneth I-PERSON
Paltrow I-PERSON
in O
Inverness B-GPE
. O

It O
just O
does O
n't O
sound O
what O
they O
are O
thinking O
about O
. O

And O
, O
of O
course O
, O
Stella B-PERSON
McCartney I-PERSON
is O
there O
too O
and O
apparently O
Celine B-PERSON
Dion I-PERSON
. O

But O
it O
is O
pretty O
amazing O
, O
all O
these O
Hollywood B-GPE
stars O
in O
this O
quiet O
, O
sleepy O
village O
that O
is O
n't O
really O
famous O
for O
anything O
. O

So O
this O
must O
be O
a O
real O
boom O
to O
the O
local O
economy O
? O

Oh O
absolutely O
, O
I O
mean O
it O
's O
been O
estimated O
that O
3 B-MONEY
million I-MONEY
pounds I-MONEY
, O
which O
is O
about B-MONEY
5 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
, O
will O
be O
made O
over O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
in O
Dornoch B-GPE
just O
from O
journalists O
and O
celebrities O
and O
sort O
of O
sightseers O
I O
guess O
coming O
to O
see O
where O
Madonna B-PERSON
got O
married O
. O

Gosh O
, O
this O
must O
be O
you O
know O
about B-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
times O
the O
local O
budget O
there O
. O

Yeah O
, O
absolutely O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
'll O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
all O
that O
money O
out O
there O
. O

There O
is O
only O
so O
many O
sheep O
you O
can O
buy O
. O

But O
the B-ORG
Scottish I-ORG
Tourist I-ORG
Board I-ORG
are O
also O
planning O
on O
cashing O
in O
on O
it O
and O
they O
're O
estimating O
some B-MONEY
60 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
will O
be O
made O
over O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
just O
with O
people O
coming O
to O

of O

As O

recalls O
, O
the O
main O
incentive O
for O
studying O
under O
Li B-PERSON
Chung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
sheng I-PERSON
was O
that O
Li B-PERSON

fees O
were O
relatively O
affordable O

Other O

charged O
upwards O

45 B-MONEY

with O
fees O
at O

run O

reaching O
60 B-MONEY

No O

Rescuing O

The O

the B-DATE

did O
nothing O

As O
Hsia B-PERSON
recalls O
, O
the O
only O

materials O
they O
could O
get O

were O
red O

black O
ink O
, O
courtesy O
of O
the O
military O
, O

. O

Sometimes O
they O
mixed O
the O
ink O
with O
glue O
to O
produce O
an O
oil O

. O

Scraping O
together O
the O

for O
just O
one B-CARDINAL
tube O
of O
oil O

involved O
considerable O
effort O

and O
Hsia B-PERSON
remembers O
repeatedly O
uncapping O
that O
single O
tube O
to O
breathe O
in O
the O
lovely O
scent O
of O

. O

The O
painters O
took O
turns O
taking O
off O
their O

to O
model O
for O
each O
other O

and O
Hsia B-PERSON
would O
sometimes O

many O

found O
that O

Some O

still O
bemoaning O

Raising O
the O
banner O
of O

the O

a O
declaration O

Chinese B-NORP
art O

inevitable O
decline O
if O
it O

Only O
through O
the O
introduction O
of O

they O
said O
, O
could O
the O
boundless O
resources O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
art O
tradition O
be O
revitalized O
. O

The O
declaration O
, O
which O
Hsia B-PERSON
drafted O
, O
shows O
that O
the O
group O

objective O
was O
to O
modernize O
Chinese B-NORP
art O
by O
drawing O
Western B-NORP
artistic O
concepts O
and O
methods O
into O
the O
production O
of O
essentially O
Chinese B-NORP
works O

This O
insistence O
on O
the O

been O
a O

tiny O

in O
the O

with O
barely O
enough O

up O

He O
supported O
himself O
doing O
miscellaneous O
jobs O
, O
working O
on O
people O

houses O
and O
restoring O

. O

Times O
were O
tough O
, O
but O
it O
was O
during O
this O
period O
that O
he O
found O
what O
he O
had O
been O
probing O
for O
in O
his O
use O
of O
line O
, O
and O
started O
on O
the O
" O
fuzzy O
people O
" O
phase O
of O
his O
output O
. O

Hsia B-PERSON
's O
fuzzy O
people O
were O
born O
into O
his O
work O
as O
if O
by O
a O
natural O
process O
. O

While O
experimenting O
with O
a O
tangle O
of O
lines O
Hsia B-PERSON
found O
unidentifiable O
clusters O
taking O
shape O
, O
from O
which O
human O
forms O
began O
to O
emerge O
. O

" O
This O
was O
something O
I O
really O
knew O
I O
could O
work O
with O
, O
" O
recalls O
Hsia B-PERSON
. O

It O
was O
a O
case O
of O
" O
seizing O
that O
special O
thing O
of O
your O
own O
, O
" O
which O
for O
an O
artist O
is O
of O
the O
utmost O
importance O
. O

Like O
a O
Taoist B-NORP
priest O
painting O
magic O
symbols O
, O
Hsia B-PERSON
uses O
line O
to O
create O
human O
figures O
and O
the O
written O
word O
to O
invoke O
power O
. O

With O
rapid O
, O
sweeping O
strokes O
of O
the O
brush O
he O
creates O
fluid O
, O
free O
- O
floating O
figures O
, O
without O
faces O
or O
personalities O
, O
performing O
their O
allotted O
roles O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
a O
coldly O
linear O
realm O
. O

The O
resulting O
images O
reflect O
the O
alienation O
of O
modern O
life O
, O
conveying O
a O
sense O
of O
illusion O
and O
impermanence O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
Hsia B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
himself O
, O
the O
lifelong O
drifter O
, O
is O
the O
prototype O
for O
these O
blurry O

But O
then O
again O
, O
which O
of O
us O
is O
not O
in O
transit O
, O
drifting O
through O
this O
brief O
existence O
? O

" O
As O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
say O
, O
man O
is O
a O
passenger O
through O
life O
who O
is O
gone O
in O
an O
instant O

Hsia B-PERSON

very O
much O
within O

So O
says O

, O
one B-CARDINAL
of O

While O

Hsia B-PERSON
received O
a O

from O
a O
friend O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
saying O
: O
" O
Life O

easier O
here O

" O

Soon O
afterwards O
he O
moved O
to O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
renting O
a O
cheap O
loft O
in O
SoHo B-LOC
and O
supporting O
himself O
as O
a O
furniture O
restorer O
. O

Photorealism O
was O
the O
vogue O
in O
American B-NORP
painting O
at O
the O
time O
. O

It O
did O
n't O
appeal O
to O
Hsia B-PERSON
at O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
but O
he O
knew O
he O
had O
to O
learn O
something O
in O
his O
new O
country O
of O
residence O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
needed O
to O
produce O
work O
that O
was O
commercially O
viable O
. O

He O
began O
employing O
photographic O
effects O
, O
for O
example O
depicting O
a O
crowd O
of O
passersby O
on O
a O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
street O
as O
a O
speeding O
blur O
. O

His O
work O
now O
became O
populated O
with O
" O
floating O
people O
" O
of O
this O
kind O
, O
although O
in O
spirit O
they O
were O
still O
the O
fuzzy O
people O
of O
his O
earlier O
period O
. O

Hsia B-PERSON
spent O
over O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
painting O
in O
the O
cavernous O
gloom O
of O
his O
loft O
, O
eating O
Chinese B-NORP
food O
and O
listening O
to O
traditional O
Chinese B-NORP
opera O
music O
. O

The O
walls O
of O
the O
loft O
were O
pasted O
with O
simple O
verses O
, O
written O
by O
Hsia B-PERSON
in O
language O
that O
was O
part O
literary O
Chinese B-NORP
and O
part O
colloquial O
. O

" O
I O
was O
like O
a O
Chinese B-NORP
person O
dwelling O
in O
a O
Chinese B-NORP
concession O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
, O
" O
says O
Hsia B-PERSON
with O
a O
laugh O
. O

The O
biggest O
boon O
of O
living O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
was O
that O
this O
was O
where O
Hsia B-PERSON
met O
his O
wife O
Wu B-PERSON
Shuang I-PERSON

hsi I-PERSON
. O

Wu B-PERSON
had O
grown O
up O
in O
a O
contented O
home O
never O
knowing O

, O
and O
held O
a O
PhD B-WORK_OF_ART

She O
met O
Hsia B-PERSON
through O
the O

Hsieh B-PERSON
Li I-PERSON

fa I-PERSON
, O
and O
since O
then O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
have O
shared O
a O
simple O
and O
quiet O
life O
together O
. O

" O
Feeling O
anxious O
when O
the O
old O
lady O
's O
not O
here O
, O
and O
looking O
listlessly O
out O
the O
window O

So O
bored O
of O

it O
's O
much O
better O
when O
the O
silly O

around O

" O

So O
runs O
one O
of O
Hsia B-PERSON

light O

testifying O
to O
the O

only O
came O
together O
relatively O
late O

Going O

Hsia B-PERSON
returned O

With O

at O
NT$ B-MONEY
35,000 I-MONEY

the O

was O
on O

Hsia B-PERSON

" O
silly O

was O
in O

when O
it O
came O

says O

Financial O
help O

: O
rough O

an O

the O

control O

only O

also O
graduated O

A O
great O
deal O

effort O
has O
been O
devoted O
to O
opening O
new O

in O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Besides O
institutions O
devoted O
to O
the O
natural O
sciences O
, O
the O
main O
focus O
has O
been O
on O
local O
Taiwanese B-NORP
history O
and O
aboriginal O
culture O
. O

Examples O
include O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
of I-ORG
Prehistory I-ORG
, O
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE

Yingko B-ORG

Formosan I-ORG

. O

For O
museums O
, O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
of O
course O
to O
acquire O
items O
to O
display O
. O

But O
most O
archeological O
artifacts O
are O
only O
shards O
, O
and O
the O
few O
items O
that O
have O
been O
found O
intact O
are O
jealously O
guarded O
by O
the O
institutions O
that O
dug O
them O
up O
; O
they O
are O
rarely O
lent O
out O
. O

Thus O
the B-ORG
Yingko I-ORG
Ceramics I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
's I-ORG
only O
option O
was O
to O
find O
someone O
to O
make O
copies O
of O
the O
originals O
. O

This O
was O
vital O
because O
, O
during O
the O
planning O
stage O
for O
the O
museum O
, O
it O
was O
decided O
to O
establish O
a O
very O
special O
room O

be O
called O

" O

" O
We O
felt O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE

should O
cover O
more O
than O
just O
what O

in O
the B-DATE
400 I-DATE

began O
from O
the O

, O
but O
should O
also O
include O
aboriginal O
and O
prehistoric O
pottery O
. O

But O
it O
is O
quite O
a O
challenge O
to O
effectively O
create O
such O
a O
comprehensive O
display O
, O
especially O
since O
authentic O
pieces O
are O
so O
hard O
to O
come O
by O
. O

NTU B-ORG

" O
This O
was O

by O
that O

we O

the O

is O
renowned O
in O
the O

in O
Taiwan B-GPE
for O
his O

He O
has O
done O
the O

Lu B-PERSON
asked O

for O
advice O
about O
people O
qualified O
to O
do O
reproductions O
of O
ancient O

. O

She O
hit O
the O
jackpot O
, O
because O
Liu B-PERSON
happened O
to O
have O
a O
good O
friend O
named O
Cheng B-PERSON

" O
Cheng B-PERSON

three B-DATE

behind O
me O
in O

and O
we O
worked O
together O
on O

for O
many B-DATE

When O
he O
was O
in O
college O
, O
he O
worked O
on O
the O
Peinan B-NORP
and O
Chihshanyen B-NORP
sites O
, O
" O
says O
Liu B-PERSON
. O

Peinan B-NORP
society O
had O
highly O
developed O
pottery O
arts O
, O
and O
Chihshanyen B-NORP
is O
a O
multi-layered O
site O
with O
artifacts O
from O
several O
cultures O
, O
and O
the O
pottery O
is O
even O
more O
refined O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
's O
inspiration O
for O
ceramics O
originally O
came O
from O
archeology O
. O

Liu B-PERSON
continues O
: O
" O
Though O
later O
Cheng B-PERSON
left O
archeology O
to O
do O
ceramic O
art O
, O
he O
did O
not O
forget O
his O
affection O
for O
prehistoric O
pottery O
, O
and O
his O
early O
work O
was O
influenced O
by O
ancient O
painted O
pottery O
. O
" O

Liu B-PERSON
notes O
that O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
there O
has O
been O
growing O
demand O
for O
archeological O
artifacts O
for O

, O
precisely O
fitting O
with O
Cheng B-PERSON

familiarity O
with O
ceramic O

and O
his O
understanding O
of O

work O
. O

As O
Lu B-PERSON
Hsiu I-PERSON

chin I-PERSON
says O
, O
with O
the O
satisfaction O
that O
comes O
of O
knowing O
one O
has O
got O
just O
what O
one O
wants O
, O
" O
He O
is O
the O
ideal O
person O
to O
do O
reproductions O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
. O
" O

A O
ceramicist O
who O
reads O
academic O
papers O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
is O
the O
fourth B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
Cheng B-PERSON
has O
done O
reproductions O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
. O

He O
previously O
worked O
on O
special O
exhibitions O
of O
Chihshanyen B-LOC
and O
Yuanshan B-LOC
culture O
and O
also O
for O
the B-ORG
Taiwan I-ORG
Provincial I-ORG
Museum I-ORG
. O

But O
never O
before O
had O
he O
been O
given O
a O
task O
as O
challenging O
as O
making O
reproductions O
representing O
all O
the O
major O
sites O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

In O
the O
process O
of O
making O
his O
recreations O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
was O
unable O
to O
get O
around O
the O
rigid O
system O
of O
controls O
to O
secure O
any O
original O
samples O
. O

" O
What O
is O
so O
incredible O
about O
Cheng B-PERSON
Yung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
gwo I-PERSON
is O
that O
he O
only O
looked O
at O
the O
samples O
and O
took O
back O
some O
photographs O
to O
work O
with O
, O
" O
says O
Liu B-PERSON
I I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chang I-PERSON
. O

Take O
for O
example O
the O
human O
- O
faced O
jar O
from O
the O
Shisanhang B-NORP
culture O
. O

The O
visage O
depicted O
on O
the O
piece O
is O
of O
complex O
design O
, O
with O
sharp O
angles O
and O
corners O
. O

For O
the O
work O
to O
be O
faithful O
to O
the O
original O
each O
angle O
had O
to O
be O
precise O
. O

Cheng B-PERSON
tackled O
this O
problem O
by O
assembling O
a O
number O
of O
paper O
models O
before O
getting O
to O
work O
. O

But O
he O
also O
had O
to O
try O
to O
duplicate O
the O
red O
color O
of O
the O
piece O
, O
a O
color O
characteristic O
of O
Shisanhang B-NORP
pottery O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
Cheng B-PERSON
made O
a O
special O
trip O
to O
the B-LOC
Linkou I-LOC
Plateau I-LOC
to O
collect O
red O
clay O
. O

But O
he O
found O
this O
material O
impossible O
to O
get O
into O
the O
right O
shape O
, O
so O
he O
had O
to O
add O
a O
certain O
proportion O
of O
general O
- O
purpose O
potter O
's O
clay O
. O

After O
several O
tries O
, O
he O
settled O
on O
a O
combination O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
parts O
Tachia B-NORP
clay O
to O
one O
part O
Linkou B-NORP
clay O
, O
with O
a O
35 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
ratio O
of O
gravel O
, O
and O
a O
layer O
of O
100 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
Linkou B-NORP
red O
clay O
added O
to O
the O
outside O
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
polished O
the O
surface O
with O
agate O
, O
creating O
a O
glossy O
effect O
and O
increasing O
the O
richness O
of O
the O
color O
. O

Like O
a O
detective O
on O
a O
case O

Even O
Liu B-PERSON
I I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chang I-PERSON
could O
n't O
say O
enough O
about O
Cheng B-PERSON
's O
human O
- O
faced O
jar O
. O

Pointing O
to O
the O
photo O
on O
the O
cover O
of O
the O
brochure O
for O
the O
Shisanhang B-NORP
site O
museum O
, O
he O
testifies O
: O
" O
I O
was O
the O
person O
who O
dug O
up O
the O
original O
, O
so O
I O
should O
know O
- O
the O
color O
in O
the O
photograph O
is O
not O
right O
, O
while O
Cheng B-PERSON
is O
much O
closer O
to O
the O
real O
thing O
. O
" O

For O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
the O
hardest O
thing O
was O
the O
facial O
expression O
. O

" O
The O
face O
is O
not O
smiling O
, O
but O
it O
is O
not O
crying O
either O
, O
rather O
it O
looks O
a O
bit O
depressed O
. O
" O

He O
says O
that O
this O
is O
a O
very O
impractical O
piece O
, O
so O
its O
original O
purpose O
was O
probably O
decorative O
or O
ritualistic O
. O

In O
an O
effort O
to O
capture O
the O
ambivalent O
facial O
expression O
, O
he O
imagined O
the O
jar O
as O
a O
bust O
- O
length O
portrait O
of O
a O
woman O
. O

She O
would O
be O
an O
elegantly O
dressed O
noblewoman O
, O
with O
brushed O
hair O
, O
and O
jewelry O
made O
from O
shells O
, O
with O
perhaps O
an O
agate O
necklace O
. O
. O
. O
. O

" O
During O
his O
days O
as O
a O
student O
, O
" O
says O
Liu B-PERSON
of O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
" O
he O
did O
hands O
- O
on O
work O
at O
archeological O
sites O
, O
digging O
up O
shards O
, O
observing O
, O
and O
in O
his O
mind O
recreating O
the O
process O
by O
which O
they O
may O
have O
been O
made O
. O

He O
has O
always O
had O
a O
naturally O
deep O
attachment O
to O
archeology O
. O
" O

Liu B-PERSON
says O
that O
this O
is O
probably O
the O
reason O
why O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
when O
doing O
reproductions O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
, O
aims O
to O
capture O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
originals O
, O
not O
just O
their O
surface O
appearance O
. O

Even O
more O
important O
for O
reproducing O
prehistoric O
artifacts O
is O
good O
detective O
work O
. O

You O
have O
to O
be O
able O
to O
reconstruct O
the O
general O
design O
of O
the O
original O
from O
clues O
on O
just O
a O
few O
shards O
. O

Conclusions O
that O
rest O
on O
a O
single O
sample O
may O
easily O
be O
inaccurate O
. O

Cheng B-PERSON
, O
using O
his O
training O
in O
archeology O
and O
the O
concept O
of O
" O
correlation O
, O
" O
is O
able O
to O
link O
together O
a O
single O
sample O
with O
pieces O
from O
the O
same O
culture O
found O
nearby O
, O
allowing O
him O
to O
draw O
conclusions O
with O
confidence O
and O
to O
bring O
his O
creative O
abilities O
into O
play O
while O
remaining O
true O
to O
the O
original O
. O

Reproducing O
the O
spirit O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O

Stop O
right O
there O
! O

You O
might O
wonder O
: O
If O
he O
is O
making O
reproductions O
, O
how O
can O
he O
bring O
creativity O
into O
it O
? O

Cheng B-PERSON
's O
response O
is O
this O
: O
" O
I O
think O
that O
the O
original O
potters O
also O
followed O
their O
whims O
and O
improvised O
when O
they O
worked O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
rigidly O
make O
each O
embellishment O
by O
rote O
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
considers O
the O
problem O
and O
then O
adds O
: O
" O
I O
not O
only O
want O
to O
reproduce O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
originals O
, O
but O
also O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
people O
who O
made O
them O
. O
" O

The O
reconstruction O
of O
an O
Ilan B-GPE
square O
- O
patterned O
pottery O
jar O
found O
by O
Liu B-PERSON
I I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chang I-PERSON
in O
the O
town O
of O
Chiushe B-GPE
is O
a O
good O
illustration O
of O
Cheng B-PERSON
's O
whole O
approach O
. O

Upon O
inspecting O
the O
original O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
discovered O
that O
the O
walls O
were O
very O
thin O
. O

If O
the O
decorative O
pattern O
had O
been O
stamped O
on O
after O
the O
clay O
had O
been O
formed O
, O
it O
would O
certainly O
have O
ruined O
the O
shape O
. O

So O
how O
did O
the O
original O
maker O
get O
the O
pattern O
on O
there O
? O

Having O
repeatedly O
thought O
about O
this O
problem O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
concluded O
that O
prehistoric O
potters O
must O
have O
used O
an O
internal O
mold O
when O
working O
. O

Perhaps O
they O
had O
shards O
that O
they O
could O
just O
pick O
up O
from O
the O
ground O
around O
them O
. O

They O
could O
take O
the O
kneaded O
clay O
, O
wrap O
it O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
shards O
, O
and O
tap O
it O
down O
lightly O
with O
a O
wooden O
stick O
to O
make O
the O
clay O
more O
compact O
and O
solid O
. O

The O
stick O
would O
have O
patterns O
carved O
into O
it O
which O
would O
then O
be O
left O
imprinted O
on O
the O
clay O
. O

But O
this O
decorative O
effect O
, O
thinks O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
was O
probably O
secondary B-ORDINAL
to O
the O
functional O
purpose O
of O
compacting O
the O
clay O
. O

With O
these O
ideas O
in O
mind O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
first B-ORDINAL
ground O
up O
a O
handful O
of O
gravel O
, O
added O
it O
to O
the O
clay O
, O
and O
kneaded O
it O
vigorously O
. O

Then O
he O
took O
a O
mold O
that O
had O
been O
made O
from O
the O
original O
sample O
, O
and O
spread O
the O
clay O
- O
now O
with O
the O
texture O
of O
pizza O
dough O
- O
on O
the O
outside O
. O

Then O
he O
tapped O
it O
with O
a O
small O
stick O
, O
which O
he O
had O
personally O
prepared O
by O
paring O
off O
the O
bark O
and O
carving O
a O
pattern O
of O
squares O
into O
the O
wood O
. O

Next O
he O
cut O
away O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
jar O
and O
carefully O
removed O
it O
. O

He O
repeated O
the O
process O
to O
make O
the O
top O
section O
, O
then O
connected O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
parts O
. O

Then O
, O
with O
his O
right O
hand O
he O
picked O
up O
the O
wood O
stick O
and O
tapped O
around O
the O
outside O
, O
while O
with O
his O
left O
he O
held O
a O
mushroom O
- O
shaped O
object O
against O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
jar O
to O
absorb O
the O
shock O
and O
prevent O
the O
jar O
from O
collapsing O
inward O
. O

A O
careful O
examination O
of O
the O
finished O
jar O
- O
with O
its O
square O
pattern O
already O
imprinted O
- O
showed O
it O
to O
look O
exactly O
like O
the O
sample O
in O
the O
photo O
. O

Dialogue O
with O
academia O

To O
reconstruct O
these O
36 B-CARDINAL
pieces O
of O
pottery O
, O
as O
much O
as O
he O
could O
Cheng B-PERSON
used O
the O
same O
tools O
as O
were O
available O
to O
their O
original O
makers O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
he O
avoided O
using O
any O
iron O
implements O
, O
since O
none O
had O
been O
available O
back O
then O
. O

When O
making O
the O
ceramic O
boar O
, O
he O
went O
into O
the O
bamboo O
forest O
in O
front O
of O
his O
house O
and O
cut O
off O
bamboo O
branches O
by O
hand O
to O
serve O
as O
the O
pig O
's O
nostrils O
. O

When O
there O
were O
no O
ready O
- O
made O
tools O
available O
, O
he O
made O
his O
own O
, O
such O
as O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
" O
mushroom O
head O
. O
" O

" O
Such O
a O
' O
mushroom O
head O
' O
was O
unearthed O
at O
the O
Peinan B-NORP
site O
, O
" O
says O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
" O
and O
archeologists O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
it O
was O
for O
. O

But O
people O
like O
me O
who O
make O
pottery O
can O
identify O
its O
function O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
look O
. O
" O

Liu B-PERSON
I I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chang I-PERSON
states O
that O
his O
conversations O
with O
Cheng B-PERSON
have O
given O
him O
much O
food O
for O
thought O
and O
allowed O
him O
to O
more O
accurately O
visualize O
the O
lifestyles O
and O
technology O
of O
prehistoric O
peoples O
. O

" O
We O
help O
each O
other O
a O
lot O
. O
" O

For O
instance O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
has O
brought O
his O
ceramicist O
's O
mind O
's O
eye O
to O
bear O
on O
the O
mystery O
of O
why O
gravel O
was O
mixed O
into O
prehistoric O
pottery O
. O

In O
virtually O
all O
archeological O
reports O
, O
prehistoric O
pottery O
includes O
gravel O
, O
usually O
at O
a O
level O
of O
25 B-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
30 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

Some O
also O
includes O
shells O
or O
hornblende O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
not O
because O
prehistoric O
people O
were O
unable O
to O
get O
clay O
of O
greater O
purity O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
the O
clay O
they O
used O
was O
often O
of O
higher O
quality O
than O
clay O
today B-DATE
. O

Thus O
Cheng B-PERSON
concludes O
that O
the O
inclusion O
of O
gravel O
must O
have O
been O
deliberate O
. O

Cheng B-PERSON
explains O
: O
" O
These O
days O
most O
ceramic O
artists O
buy O
factory O
- O
produced O
clay O
that O
meets O
a O
certain O
set O
of O
specifications O
. O

Rarely O
would O
anybody O
add O
gravel O
. O

After O
all O
, O
everybody O
uses O
electric O
kilns O
, O
because O
they O
offer O
precise O
temperature O
control O
, O
so O
their O
pieces O
can O
be O
fired O
slowly O
, O
with O
no O
risk O
of O
cracking O
from O
overly O
rapid O
heating O
or O
cooling O
. O
" O

Prehistoric O
wisdom O

But O
prehistoric O
peoples O
did O
not O
possess O
any O
of O
these O
things O
. O

They O
had O
to O
dig O
, O
rinse O
, O
and O
filter O
their O
own O
clay O
, O
shape O
the O
pieces O
, O
then O
fire O
them O
all O
together O
in O
a O
big O
pile O
of O
wood O
under O
the O
open O
sky O
. O

This O
is O
why O
they O
added O
gravel O
to O
the O

, O

mixing O

into O

, O
to O
increase O
its O
strength O
and O
so O
avoid O
having O
the O
pottery O
fracture O
as O
it O
first B-ORDINAL
expanded O
under O
the O
heat O
and O
then O
contracted O
as O
it O
cooled O
. O

From O
this O
we O
can O
see O
, O
affirms O
Cheng B-PERSON
, O
that O
" O
prehistoric O
people O
understood O
how O
to O
use O
mixed O
materials O
, O
which O
was O
a O
major O
breakthrough O
in O
technique O
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
found O
further O
indirect O
confirmation O
of O
his O
judgement O
about O
the O
technical O
skills O
possessed O
by O
prehistoric O
makers O
of O
pottery O
from O
a O
documentary O
on O
Japan B-GPE
's O
NHK B-ORG
network O
. O

In O
the O
film O
, O
a O
Japanese B-NORP
ceramic O
artist O
, O
an O
individual O
who O
is O
considered O
a O
" O
national O
treasure O
" O
of O
Japan B-GPE
, O
goes O
to O
visit O
a O
small O
island O
in O
Indonesia B-GPE
where O
everybody O
makes O
pottery O
. O

When O
he O
arrives O
there O
, O
this O
great O
master O
becomes O
more O
like O
a O
youthful O
acolyte O
. O

As O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
ceramicist O
slowly O
and O
steadily O
works O
the O
clay O
at O
his O
wheel O
, O
an O
elderly O
aboriginal O
woman O
working O
next O
to O
him O
just O
turns O
the O
wheel O
twice O
with O
her O
feet O
and O
shapes O
a O
finished O
ceramic O
jug O
. O

The O
ability O
of O
the O
indigenous O
people O
on O
this O
small O
island O
to O
judge O
the O
quality O
of O
clay O
was O
even O
more O
impressive O
. O

" O
They O
just O
toss O
some O
clay O
into O
their O
mouths O
and O
chew O
it O
around O
for O
a O
while O
, O
and O
they O
know O
whether O
it O
is O
good O
material O
or O
not O
. O

When O
we O
buy O
clay O
, O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
we O
look O
at O
is O
the O
written O
specifications O
, O
" O
says O
Cheng B-PERSON
with O
a O
laugh O
. O

Firebrand O

Though O
Cheng B-PERSON
was O
able O
to O
complete O
the O
full O
set O
of O
prehistoric O
pottery O
reproductions O
requested O
by O
the O

, O
and O
at O
a O

of O

received O
high O

from O
the O

and O
from O

Liu B-PERSON
I I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
chang I-PERSON
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
himself O
still O
feels O
there O
are O
things O
that O
he O
could O
have O
done O
better O
. O

" O
The O
hardest O
part O
was O
getting O
the O
final O
color O
and O
texture O
of O
the O
originals O
to O
come O
through O
in O
the O
reproductions O
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
relates O
that O
in O
this O
regard O
there O
were O
some O
factors O
he O
could O
manipulate O
, O
but O
others O
that O
were O
beyond O
his O
control O
. O

" O
What O
kind O
of O
clay O
did O
prehistoric O
people O
use O
? O

At O
what O
temperature O
did O
they O
fire O
the O
pots O
? O

You O
do O
n't O
get O
the O
same O
feeling O
from O
artifacts O
that O
have O
been O
buried O
in O
the O
ground O
for O
thousands O
of O
years O
, O
exposed O
to O
microbes O
and O
chemical O
transformations O
, O
that O
you O
can O
get O
instantly O
from O
the O
recreated O
works O
that O
I O
am O
doing O
today B-DATE
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
admits O
that O
if O
he O
utilized O
extraneous O
processes O
, O
such O
as O
exposing O
the O
pieces O
to O
wood O
smoke O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
he O
could O
get O
the O
colors O
closer O
to O
those O
of O
the O
actual O
artifacts O
, O
but O
then O
he O
would O
be O
losing O
something O
else O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Thus O
, O
before O
getting O
down O
to O
work O
on O
the O
final O
version O
of O
each O
piece O
, O
he O
made O
numerous O
trials O
, O
using O
different O
proportions O
of O
iron O
oxide O
, O
trying O
different O
temperatures O
, O
sometimes O
buffing O
the O
piece O
to O
make O
it O
glossy O
and O
other O
times O
not O
, O
to O
get O
as O
close O
as O
possible O
to O
the O
correct O
overall O
effect O
. O

And O
then O
of O
course O
there O
was O
the O
problem O
that O
the O
pottery O
- O
making O
process O
in O
prehistoric O
times O
was O
markedly O
different O
from O
the O
modern O
procedure O
. O

" O
These O
days O
we O
use O
electric O
kilns O
. O

Though O
they O
are O
safer O
, O
they O
do O
not O
leave O
the O
same O
traces O
that O
prehistoric O
pottery O
has O
from O
being O
fired O
outdoors O
with O
uneven O
exposure O
to O
the O
heat O
. O
" O

Cheng B-PERSON
feels O
very O
strongly O
about O
this O
. O

In O
Western B-NORP
mythology O
, O
man O
escaped O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
other O
animals O
by O
stealing O
fire O
from O
the O
gods O
, O
and O
it O
was O
fire O
that O
allowed O
the O
rise O
of O
bronze O
- O
age O
civilization O
and O
pottery O
cultures O
. O

But O
now O
, O
fire O
has O
been O
taken O
offstage O
, O
and O
replaced O
by O
electricity O
. O

The O
relationship O
between O
fire O
and O
potters O
has O
been O
severed O
by O
modern O
kilns O
. O

" O
There O
is O
only O
the O
moment O
when O
you O
turn O
on O
the O
power O
- O
click O
- O
there O
is O
no O
physical O
sensation O
of O
kindling O
wood O
or O
smoke O
. O
" O

Back O
to O
the O
tribal O
experience O

After O
mulling O
over O
his O
experiences O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
decided O
that O
he O
is O
going O
to O
save O
up O
money O
to O
build O
the O
finest O
wood O
- O
fire O
pottery O
kiln O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

This O
could O
not O
only O
restore O
the O
relationship O
between O
fire O
and O
potter O
, O
but O
could O
also O
induce O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
ceramic O
artists O
- O
among O
whom O
Cheng B-PERSON
believes O
there O
is O
currently O
too O
much O
division O
and O
distance O
- O
to O
cooperate O
with O
each O
other O
. O

" O
This O
could O
encourage O
interaction O
and O
partnership O
, O
and O
even O
in O
a O
small O
way O
create O
a O
sense O
of O
having O
returned O
to O
the O
tribal O
village O

Wang B-PERSON
Chuang I-PERSON

was O
born O
in O
Hebei B-GPE

in O
1909 B-DATE

. O

But O
the O
son O
had O
no O
wish O
to O
become O
an O
official O
, O
and O
instead O
opted O
to O
spend O
his O
days O
at O
home O
, O
freely O
soaking O
up O
the O
atmosphere O
of O
art O
and O
culture O
. O

He O
began O
tracing O
characters O
at O
age O
six B-DATE
, O
under O
his O
father O
's O
direction O
, O
and O
when O
he O
was O
12 B-DATE
he O
started O
learning O
how O
to O
carve O
seals O
. O

His O
grandfather O
worked O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
and O
every O
year O
brought O
back O
valuable O
calligraphic O
artifacts O
that O
he O
had O
purchased O
there O
. O

Young O
Wang B-PERSON
thus O
became O
familiar O
, O
from O
an O
early O
age O
, O
with O
the O
works O
and O
implements O
of O
prominent O
calligraphers O
from O
throughout O
the O
land O
. O

At O
an O
age O
when O
other O
children O
were O
still O
busy O
at O
their O
games O
, O
Wang B-PERSON
used O
to O
bury O
himself O
among O
books O
, O
for O
hours O
on O
end O
, O
in O
the O
family O
library O
. O

Like O
all O
Chinese B-NORP
children O
, O
Wang B-PERSON
began O
by O
imitating O
the O
firm O
and O
well O
- O
formed O
calligraphy O
of O
Yan B-PERSON
Zhenqing I-PERSON
. O

He O
went O
on O
to O
learn O
the O
styles O
of O
many O
other O
masters O
of O
the O
art O
, O
progressing O
in O
his O
teens O
to O
the O
running O
script O
and O
grass O
script O
of O
the O
ancient O
master O
Wang B-PERSON
Xizhi I-PERSON
, O
which O
became O
central O
to O
his O

calligraphic O
style O
. O

Love O

At O
age O
20 B-CARDINAL
Wang B-PERSON
went O
to O
Beiping B-GPE

called O

, O
and O
like O
many O

at O
that O
time O

when O
the O
cultures O
of O
East B-LOC
and O
West B-LOC
were O
first B-ORDINAL
coming O
into O

- O
he O
immersed O
himself O
in O

, O
learning O
all O
he O
could O
about O
Western B-NORP
painting O
, O
sculpture O
, O
film O
and O
literature O
. O

However O
, O
perhaps O
due O
to O
his O
familiarity O
with O
what O
was O
best O
in O
Chinese B-NORP
art O
, O
Wang B-PERSON
did O
n't O
take O
this O

any O
further O

Instead O
he O
opted O

the O
life O

Hsueh B-PERSON

recalls O
how O
he O
once O
watched O
Wang B-PERSON
carving O
seals O
in O
his O
study O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
giving O
careful O
thought O
to O
the O
layout O
and O
making O
draft O
after O
draft O
on O
paper O
. O

Having O
settled O
on O
a O
layout O
, O
he O
would O
then O
carve O
the O
seal O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
go O
, O
using O
the O
knife O
with O
fluid O
ease O
. O

Thus O
it O
was O
that O
he O
could O
fill O
the O
confined O
space O
on O
a O
seal O
with O
expansive O
, O
forceful O
- O
looking O
characters O
. O

What O
people O
admired O
most O
about O
Wang B-PERSON
was O
his O
ability O
to O
wield O
the O
knife O
like O
a O
writing O
brush O
, O
carving O
lines O
that O
seemed O
free O
and O
flowing O
. O

Every O
stroke O
was O
made O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
cut O
of O
the O
blade O
- O
in O
contrast O
to O
most O
seal O
carvers O
who O
need O
two B-CARDINAL
cuts O
to O
achieve O
the O
appearance O
of O
a O
brush O
stroke O
. O

This O
was O
especially O
so O
of O
his O
signature O
mark O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
seal O
. O

Careful O
examination O
of O
Wang B-PERSON
's O
seals O
shows O
that O
the O
running O
script O
of O
the O
signature O
mark O
is O
carved O
with O
every O
bit O
as O
much O
grace O
and O
fluidity O
as O
if O
done O
by O
brush O
and O
ink O
, O
but O
augmented O
by O
the O
hardness O
that O
is O
intrinsic O
to O
stone O
inscriptions O
. O

For O
individuality O

department I-ORG
of O

explains O
that B-NORP
the O
art O
of O
Chinese B-PERSON
calligraphy O
can O
broadly O
be O
divided B-PERSON
into I-PERSON
two O
main O
branches O
: O
the O
nantie O
, O
or O
Southern O
style O
, O
in O
which O
beauty O
of O
form O
is O
emphasized O
, O
and O
the O
more O
rugged O
beibei O
or O
Northern O
style O
. O

Wang O
Chuang O
- O
wei O
established O
his O
style O
relatively O
early O
, O
and O
up O
until O
he O
was O
in O
his O
forties O
his O
works O
were O
characterized O
by O
the O
smooth O
, O
fluid O
forms O
of O
the O
nantie O
style O
. O

However O
, O
Wang O
himself O
was O
alert O
to O
the O
risk O
of O
his O
calligraphy O
becoming O
over-refined O
, O
and O
he O
began O
incorporating O
the O
robustness O
of O
the O
beibei O
style O
into B-PERSON
his O
brushwork O
, O
aiming B-CARDINAL
for B-NORP
a O
style O
that O
was B-GPE
more O
" O
raw O
and O
intense O
. O
" O

As B-ORDINAL
a O
result O
, O
his O
calligraphy O
came O
to O
combine O
fluid B-WORK_OF_ART
grace I-WORK_OF_ART
with I-WORK_OF_ART
a I-WORK_OF_ART
core O
of O
doughty O
toughness O
. O

It O
was O
a O
style O
well O
suited O
to O
the O
kind B-ORG
of I-ORG
man I-ORG
he O
was O
: O
a O
bluff O
northerner O
with O
the O
perfectionist O
's O
approach O
to O
art O
. O

When O
he O
was O
in O
his O
fifties O
Wang O
came O
to O
regard O
" O
writing O
characters O
" O
as O
a O
form O
of O
painting O
, O
and O
he O
began O
to O
innovate O
and B-GPE
experiment O
with O
the O
art O
. O

For O
example O
, O
he O
created O
" O
multiple O
- O
shadow O
" O
calligraphy O
, O
in O
which O
characters O
were O
painted O
in O
five O
overlapping O
layers O
using O
different O
consistencies O
of O
ink O
. O

He O
tried O
using B-GPE
deliberately O
crumpled O
paper O
to O
produce B-DATE
a O
mottled O
effect O
with O
the O
ink O
, O
and O
worked O
on O
a O
blurring O
effect O
, O
achieved O
by O
briefly O
dousing O
a O
freshly O
painted B-NORP
silk O
scroll O
in O
water O
. O

Despite O
the O
interest B-ORG
generated B-ORG
among B-ORG
calligraphers I-ORG
by O
these B-ORG
innovations I-ORG
, O
Wang O
was O
more O
suited O
by O
temperament O
to O
the O
established O
forms O
, O
and O
he O
eventually O
turned O
back O
to O
ancients O
for O
inspiration O
. O

He O
studied O
in O
detail O
the O
characters O
on O
the O

and O
artifacts O
, O
dating O
back O
to O
the O
first O

at O
that O
time O
being O
unearthed O
at O
Mawangdui O
and O
other O
sites O
in O
mainland O
China O
, O
and O
began O
absorbing O
their O
distinctive O
forms O
into O
his O
own O
calligraphic O
style O
. O

He O
also O
made O
poems O
and O
paired O
- O
couplets O
out O
of O
the O
ancient O
inscriptions O
, O
pioneering O
a O
personal O
" O
something O
new O
from O
something O
old O
" O
approach O
. O

" O
During O
this O
period O
his O
running O

was O
no O

as O
lean O
as O
it O
had O
been O
, O
" O

" O
It O
began O
slanting O

became O
more O

with O
swooping O
spaces O
where O
the O

was O
running O
dry O

He O

is O
plain O
and O
natural O
. O
" O

During O
his B-DATE
fifties I-DATE
he O
had O
passed O
through O
a O
period O
of O
experimentation O
and O
innovation O
, O
" O
being O
different O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
it O
, O
" O
but O
now O
he O
returned O
to O
the O
traditional O
artistic O
way O
of O
" O
being O
naturally O
different O
. O
" O

Wang B-PERSON
once O
said O
that O
an O
artistic O
aesthetic O
is O
something O
that O
emerges O
through O
long O
years O
of O
stylistic O
refinement O
and O
expression O
. O

Every O
artist O
goes O
through O
a O
non-stop O
process O
of O
evolution O
, O
accumulating O
a O
kind O
of O
natural O
grace O
as O
time O
goes O
by O
. O

If O
old O
age O
enabled O
Wang B-PERSON
to O
become O
" O
steadily O
more O
proficient O
" O
- O
as O
Buddhism B-NORP
would O
have O
it O
- O
at O
his O
art O
, O
it O
also O
made O
him O
" O
steadily O
more O
forgetful O
. O
" O

Sometimes O
, O
when O
tidying O
up O
works O
of O
poetry O
from O
years O
before O
, O
he O
would O
come O
across O
one O
that O
he O
had O
no O
recollection O
of O
ever O
writing O
. O

This O
did O
n't O
depress O
him O
, O
however O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
he O
considered O
it O
an O
advantage O
of O
memory O
loss O
that O
it O
enabled O
him O
to O
look O
more O
objectively O
at O
his O
own O
works O
, O
as O
if O
someone O
else O
had O
written O
them O
. O

With O
this O
in O
mind O
he O
came O
up O
with O
another O
style O
name O
for O
himself O
: O
" O
Forgetful O
old O
man O
. O
" O

Eventually O
he O
came O
to O
forget O
almost O
everything O
that O
had O
ever O
happened O
to O
him O
, O
both O
the O
sorrows O
and O
the O
joys O
. O

After O
a O
lifetime O
dedicated O
to O
the O
pursuit O
of O
art O
, O
Wang B-PERSON
at O
last O
entered O
that O
state O
of O
freedom O
in O
which O
" O
the O
man O
and O
his O

have O
both O
attained O
maturity O
. O
" O

When O
Wang B-PERSON

he O
once O
wrote O
the O
following O

of O

it O

the O

Before O

For O

the O

In O

The O

But O
U.S. B-GPE

rather O

cut O

Mr. O
Noriega B-PERSON

tips O
on O
emerging O

at O
his O

were O
deemed O
more O
important O
to O
U.S. B-GPE
interests O

From O
that O
point O
on O

the O
U.S. B-GPE
would O
make O
a O
practice O
of O
overlooking O
the O
Panamanian B-NORP

The O
U.S. B-GPE
has O
befriended O

turned O

And O
out O

: O
The O
U.S. B-GPE
can O
make O

still O
hope O

remove O
him O

Mr. O

the O
most O
the O

none O

ca O
n't O
we O
teach O
our O
children O
to O
read O
, O
write O
and O
reckon O
? O

It O
's O
not O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
, O
because O
we O
do O
. O

It O
's O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
. O

And O
the O
reason O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
is O
that O
effective O
education O
would O
require O
us O
to O
relinquish O
some O
cherished O
metaphysical O
beliefs O
about O
human O
nature O
in O
general O
and O
the O
human O
nature O
of O
young O
people O
in O
particular O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
violate O
some O
cherished O
vested O
interests O
. O

These O
beliefs O
so O
dominate O
our O
educational O
establishment O
, O
our O
media O
, O
our O
politicians O
, O
and O
even O
our O
parents O
that O
it O
seems O
almost O
blasphemous O
to O
challenge O
them O
. O

Here O
is O
an O
example O
. O

If O
I O
were O
to O
ask O
a O
sample O
of O
American B-NORP
parents O
, O
`` O
Do O
you O
wish O
the O
elementary O
schools O
to O
encourage O
creativity O
in O
your O
children O
? O
'' O
the O
near O
- O
unanimous O
answer O
would O
be O
, O
`` O
Yes O
, O
of O
course O
. O
'' O

But O
what O
do O
we O
mean O
, O
specifically O
, O
by O
`` O
creativity O
'' O
? O

No O
one O
can O
say O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
it O
ends O
up O
being O
equated O
with O
a O
`` O
self O
- O
expression O
'' O
that O
encourages O
the O
youngsters O
' O
`` O
self O
- O
esteem O
. O
'' O

The O
result O
is O
a O
generation O
of O
young O
people O
whose O
ignorance O
and O
intellectual O
incompetence O
is O
matched O
only O
by O
their O
good O
opinion O
of O
themselves O
. O

The O
whole O
notion O
of O
`` O
creativity O
'' O
in O
education O
was O
-LRB- O
and O
is O
-RRB- O
part O
and O
parcel O
of O
a O
romantic O
rebellion O
against O
disciplined O
instruction O
, O
which O
was O
-LRB- O
and O
is O
-RRB- O
regarded O
as O
`` O
authoritarian O
, O
'' O
a O
repression O
and O
frustration O
of O
the O
latent O
talents O
and O
the O
wonderful O
, O
if O
as O
yet O
undefined O
, O
potentialities O
inherent O
in O
the O
souls O
of O
all O
our O
children O
. O

It O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
parents O
find O
this O
romantic O
extravagance O
so O
attractive O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
these O
same O
parents O
do O
want O
their O
children O
to O
get O
a O
decent O
education O
as O
traditionally O
understood O
, O
and O
they O
have O
enough O
common O
sense O
to O
know O
what O
that O
demands O
. O

Their O
commitment O
to O
`` O
creativity O
'' O
can O
not O
survive O
adolescent O
illiteracy O
. O

American B-NORP
education O
's O
future O
will O
be O
determined O
by O
the O
degree O
to O
which O
we O
-- O
all O
of O
us O
-- O
allow O
this O
common O
sense O
to O
prevail O
over O
the O
illusions O
that O
we O
also O
share O
. O

The O
education O
establishment O
will O
fight O
against O
common O
sense O
every O
inch O
of O
the O
way O
. O

The O
reasons O
are O
complex O
, O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
simple O
reason O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
underestimated O
. O

`` O
Progressive O
education O
'' O
-LRB- O
as O
it O
was O
once O
called O
-RRB- O
is O
far O
more O
interesting O
and O
agreeable O
to O
teachers O
than O
is O
disciplined O
instruction O
. O

It O
is O
nice O
for O
teachers O
to O
think O
they O
are O
engaged O
in O
`` O
personality O
development O
'' O
and O
even O
nicer O
to O
minimize O
those O
irksome O
tests O
with O
often O
disappointing O
results O
. O

It O
also O
provides O
teachers O
with O
a O
superior O
self O
- O
definition O
as O
a O
`` O
profession O
, O
'' O
since O
they O
will O
have O
passed O
courses O
in O
educational O
psychology O
and O
educational O
philosophy O
. O

I O
myself O
took O
such O
courses O
in O
college O
, O
thinking O
I O
might O
end O
up O
a O
schoolteacher O
. O

They O
could O
all O
fairly O
be O
described O
as O
`` O
pap O
'' O
courses O
. O

But O
it O
is O
unfair O
to O
dump O
on O
teachers O
, O
as O
distinct O
from O
the O
educational O
establishment O
. O

I O
know O
many O
schoolteachers O
and O
, O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
they O
are O
seriously O
committed O
to O
conscientious O
teaching O
. O

They O
may O
not O
be O
among O
the O
`` O
best O
and O
brightest O
'' O
of O
their O
generation O
-- O
there O
are O
very O
few O
such O
people O
, O
by O
definition O
. O

But O
they O
need O
not O
be O
to O
do O
their O
jobs O
well O
. O

Yes O
, O
we O
all O
can O
remember O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
truly O
inspiring O
teachers O
from O
our B-DATE
school I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

But O
our O
education O
proceeded O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
those O
others O
, O
who O
were O
merely O
competent O
and O
conscientious O
. O

In O
this O
sense O
, O
a O
teacher O
can O
be O
compared O
to O
one O
's O
family O
doctor O
. O

If O
he O
were O
brilliant O
, O
he O
probably O
would O
not O
be O
a O
family O
doctor O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
. O

If O
he O
is O
competent O
and O
conscientious O
, O
he O
serves O
us O
well O
. O

Our O
teachers O
are O
not O
an O
important O
factor O
in O
our O
educational O
crisis O
. O

Whether O
they O
are O
or O
are O
not O
underpaid O
is O
a O
problem O
of O
equity O
; O
it O
is O
not O
an O
educational O
problem O
. O

It O
is O
silly O
libel O
on O
our O
teachers O
to O
think O
they O
would O
educate O
our O
children O
better O
if O
only O
they O
got O
a B-MONEY
few I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
a O
year O
more O
. O

It O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
libel O
the O
teachers O
' O
unions O
do O
n't O
mind O
spreading O
, O
for O
their O
own O
narrow O
purposes O
. O

It O
is O
also O
the O
kind O
of O
libel O
politicians O
find O
useful O
, O
since O
it O
helps O
them O
strike O
a O
friendly O
posture O
on O
behalf O
of O
an O
important O
constituency O
. O

But O
there O
is O
not O
one B-CARDINAL
shred O
of O
evidence O
that O
, O
other O
things O
being O
equal O
, O
salary O
differentials O
result O
in O
educational O
differentials O
. O

If O
there O
were O
such O
evidence O
, O
you O
can O
be O
sure O
you O
would O
have O
heard O
of O
it O
. O

If O
we O
wish O
to O
be O
serious O
about O
American B-NORP
education O
, O
we O
know O
exactly O
what O
to O
do O
-- O
and O
, O
just O
as O
important O
, O
what O
not O
to O
do O
. O

There O
are O
many O
successful O
schools O
scattered O
throughout O
this O
nation O
, O
some O
of O
them O
in O
the O
poorest O
of O
ghettos O
, O
and O
they O
are O
all O
sending O
us O
the O
same O
message O
. O

Conversely O
, O
there O
are O
the O
majority O
of O
unsuccessful O
schools O
, O
and O
we O
know O
which O
efforts O
at O
educational O
reform O
are O
doomed O
beforehand O
. O

We O
really O
do O
know O
all O
we O
need O
to O
know O
, O
if O
only O
we O
could O
assimilate O
this O
knowledge O
into O
our O
thinking O
. O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
it O
would O
be O
helpful O
if O
our O
political O
leaders O
were O
mute O
, O
rather O
than O
eloquently O
`` O
concerned O
. O
'' O

They O
are O
inevitably O
inclined O
to O
echo O
the O
conventional O
pap O
, O
since O
this O
is O
the O
least O
controversial O
option O
that O
is O
open O
to O
them O
. O

Thus O
at O
the O
recent O
governors O
' O
conference O
on O
education O
, O
Gov. O
Bill B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
of O
Arkansas B-GPE
announced O
that O
`` O
this O
country O
needs O
a O
comprehensive O
child O
- O
development O
policy O
for O
children O
under B-DATE
five I-DATE
. O
'' O

A O
comprehensive O
development O
policy O
for O
governors O
over B-DATE
30 I-DATE
would O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
more O
pressing O
need O
. O

What O
Gov. O
Clinton B-PERSON
is O
advocating O
, O
in O
effect O
, O
is O
extending O
the O
educational O
system O
down O
to O
the B-DATE
pre-kindergarten I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Whether O
desirable O
or O
not O
, O
this O
is O
a O
child O
- O
care O
program O
, O
not O
an O
educational O
program O
. O

We O
know O
that O
very O
early O
exposure O
to O
schooling O
improves O
performance O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
grade O
, O
but O
afterward O
the O
difference O
is O
quickly O
washed O
away O
. O

Let O
us O
sum O
up O
what O
we O
do O
know O
about O
education O
and O
about O
those O
education O
reforms O
that O
do O
work O
and O
do O
n't O
work O
: O
-- O
`` O
Parental O
involvement O
'' O
is O
a O
bad O
idea O
. O

Parents O
are O
too O
likely O
to O
blame O
schools O
for O
the O
educational O
limitations O
of O
their O
children O
. O

Parents O
should O
be O
involved O
with O
their O
children O
's O
education O
at O
home O
, O
not O
in O
school O
. O

They O
should O
see O
to O
it O
that O
their O
kids O
do O
n't O
play O
truant O
; O
they O
should O
make O
certain O
that O
the O
children O
spend O
enough O
time O
doing O
homework O
; O
they O
should O
scrutinize O
the O
report O
card O
. O

If O
parents O
are O
dissatisfied O
with O
a O
school O
, O
they O
should O
have O
the O
option O
of O
switching O
to O
another O
. O

-- O
`` O
Community O
involvement O
'' O
is O
an O
even O
worse O
idea O
. O

Here O
, O
the O
experience O
of O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
City I-GPE
is O
decisive O
. O

Locally O
elected O
school O
boards O
, O
especially O
in O
our O
larger O
cities O
, O
become O
the O
prey O
of O
ambitious O
, O
generally O
corrupt O
, O
and O
invariably O
demagogic O
local O
politicians O
or O
would O
- O
be O
politicians O
. O

New B-GPE
York I-GPE
is O
in O
the O
process O
of O
trying O
to O
disengage O
itself O
from O
a O
20 B-DATE
- I-DATE
year I-DATE
- I-DATE
old I-DATE
commitment O
to O
this O
system O
of O
school O
governance O
, O
even O
as O
Chicago B-GPE
and O
other O
cities O
are O
moving O
to O
institute O
it O
. O

-- O
In O
most O
states B-GPE
, O
increasing O
expenditures O
on O
education O
, O
in O
our O
current O
circumstances O
, O
will O
probably O
make O
things O
worse O
, O
not O
better O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
simple O
: O
Education O
takes O
place O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
where O
the O
influence O
of O
money O
is O
minimal O
. O

Decades O
of O
educational O
research O
tell O
us O
unequivocally O
that O
even O
smaller O
classes O
have O
zero B-CARDINAL
effect O
on O
the O
academic O
performance O
of O
the O
pupils O
-- O
though O
they O
may O
sometimes O
be O
desirable O
for O
other O
reasons O
. O

The O
new O
money O
flows O
into O
the O
already O
top O
- O
heavy O
administrative O
structure O
, O
which O
busies O
itself O
piling O
more O
and O
more O
paper O
work O
on O
the O
teachers O
. O

There O
is O
neither O
mystery O
nor O
paradox O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
as O
educational O
expenditures O
-LRB- O
in O
real O
terms O
-RRB- O
have O
increased O
sharply O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
quarter I-DATE
- I-DATE
of I-DATE
- I-DATE
a I-DATE
- I-DATE
century I-DATE
-- O
we O
now O
spend O
more O
per O
pupil O
than O
any O
other O
country O
in O
the O
world O
-- O
educational O
performance O
has O
declined O
. O

That O
is O
the O
way O
the O
system O
works O
. O

-- O
Students O
should O
move O
up O
the O
educational O
ladder O
as O
their O
academic O
potential O
allows O
. O

No O
student O
should O
be O
permitted O
to O
be O
graduated O
from O
elementary O
school O
without O
having O
mastered O
the O
3 B-CARDINAL
R O
's O
at O
the O
level O
that O
prevailed O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

This O
means O
`` O
tracking O
, O
'' O
whose O
main O
purpose O
is O
less O
to O
permit O
the O
gifted O
youngsters O
to O
flourish O
-LRB- O
though O
that O
is O
clearly O
desirable O
-RRB- O
than O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
less O
gifted O
get O
the O
necessary O
grounding O
for O
further O
study O
or O
for O
entering O
the O
modern O
world O
of O
work O
. O

The O
notion O
that O
tracking O
is O
somehow O
`` O
undemocratic O
'' O
is O
absurd O
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
education O
is O
to O
encourage O
young O
men O
and O
women O
to O
realize O
their O
full O
academic O
potential O
. O

No O
one O
in O
his O
right O
mind O
actually O
believes O
that O
we O
all O
have O
an O
equal O
academic O
potential O
. O

-- O
It O
is O
generally O
desirable O
to O
use O
older O
textbooks O
-- O
many O
of O
them O
, O
alas O
, O
out O
of O
print O
-- O
rather O
than O
newer O
ones O
. O

The O
latter O
are O
modish O
, O
trendy O
, O
often O
downright O
silly O
, O
and O
at O
best O
insubstantial O
. O

They O
are O
based O
on O
dubious O
psychological O
and O
sociological O
theories O
rather O
than O
on O

This O
is O
a O
topic O
that O
I O
have O
spent O
much O
of O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
trying O
to O
get O
people O
to O
be O
concerned O
about O
. O

To O
put O
it O
simply O
, O
the O
rebalancing O
theory O
holds O
that O
if O
the O
gap O
between O
countries O
with O
trade O
surpluses O
and O
deficits O
continues O
to O
expand O
, O
it O
will O
harm O
the O
sustained O
growth O
of O
the O
world O

. O

In O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
regular O
account O
deficits O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
averaged O
more O
than O
800 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
annually O
; O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
accepted O
nearly O
70 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O

of O
the O
world O

other O
countries O
, O
the O
equivalent O
of O
needing O
to O
bring O

some B-MONEY
35 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
per O
average O

. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
the O
rebalancing O
plan O
the O
world O
so O
urgently O
needs O
is O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
thorough O
reshaping O
of O
the O
global O
savings O
mix O
- O
that O
is O
, O
an O
improvement O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
savings O
rate O
, O
which O
has O
been O
stagnant O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
and O
a O
lessening O
of O
excessive O
savings O
in O
other O
countries O
-LRB- O
especially O
in O
Asia B-LOC
and O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
-RRB- O
. O

If O
the O
world O
's O
savings O
mix O
does O
not O
change O
, O
the O
rebalancing O
theory O
holds O
that O
the O
situation O
will O
be O
very O
harmful O
to O
outside O
financing O
in O
deficit O
economic O
systems O
. O

As O
for O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
this O
will O
augur O
low O
exchange O
rates O
for O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
dollar O
, O
and O
an O
expansion O
of O
effective O
interest O
rates O
on O
U.S. B-GPE
- O
dollar O
capital O
. O

But O
this O
did O
not O
happen O
in O
2006 B-DATE
. O

Although O
as O
the O
end O
of O
the O
year O
approached O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
dollar O
dropped O
somewhat O
, O
and O
effective O
interest O
rates O
continued O
to O
climb O
, O
this O
movement O
was O
still O
very O
far O
from O
the O
radical O
adjustments O
predicted O
by O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
rebalancing O
theory O
. O

This O
phenomenon O
has O
two B-CARDINAL
possible O
explanations O
: O
one B-CARDINAL
is O
that O
other O
factors O
cropped O
up O
and O
intervened O
; O
the O
other O
is O
that O
the O
theory O
basically O
does O
not O
stand O
up O
. O

I O
choose O
the O
former O
; O
I O
believe O
the O
reason O
lies O
in O
the O
prolongation O
of O
the O
period O
of O
excess O
current O
capital O
worldwide O
and O
the O
policy O
of O
central O
banks O
in O
Asia B-LOC
and O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
of O
buying O
up O
U.S. B-GPE
dollars O
. O

So O
long O
as O
these O
forces O
are O
in O
play O
, O
the O
effects O
on O
financial O
markets O
recognized O
by O
the O
rebalancing O
theory O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
softened O
. O

Globalized O
tracks O
. O

Last B-DATE
year I-DATE
was O
an O
important O
milestone O
in O
the O
globalization O
process O
. O

Benefiting O
from O
an O
acceleration O
in O
the O
pace O
of O
transnational O
integration O
, O
global O
trade O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL

30 B-PERCENT

in O
2006 B-DATE
. O

From B-DATE
1998 I-DATE

2006 I-DATE
, O
the O

42 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
overall O

in O
the O
world O

This O
kind O
of O
trade O
concentration O
has O
the O
potential O
for O
a O
huge O
macroeconomic O
impact O
on O
global O

of O

in O
terms O
of O

to O
a O
strong O
anti-inflationary O
counterblast O
blowing O
on O
the O
developed O
world O
. O

Despite O
rapid O
rises O
in O
energy O

, O
it O
is O
estimated O
that O
in O
2006 B-DATE
the O
CPI O

in O
the O

only O
24 B-PERCENT

each O

Although O

led O

I O
am O
worried O
that O

are O
discarding O
too O
quickly O
the O
risk O
of O
a O
similar O
situation O
occurring O
in O
2007 B-DATE
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
adjustment O
of O
the O
housing O
market O
has O
just O
begun O
; O
taking O
the O
number O
of O
workers O
in O
the O
U.S. B-NORP
home O

industry O
as O
an O
example O
, O
current O

are O
only O
15 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
below O
the O
cumulative O
increase O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
over-indebted O
American B-NORP
consumers O
with O
their O
insufficient O
savings O
are O
using O
their O
increasingly O
overvalued O
houses O
to O
support O
their O
excessive O
consumption O
; O
and O
now O
housing O
prices O
are O
turning O
soft O
, O
people O
are O
losing O
their O
rights O
to O
redeem O
their O
mortgage O
, O
and O
consumer O
demand O
will O
face O
greater O
pressures O
. O

Third B-ORDINAL
, O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
dim O
outlook O
for O
housing O
and O
consumer O
markets O
and O
high O
sensitivity O
to O
forecasts O
of O
ultimate O
market O
demand O
, O
capital O

slacken O
; O
orders O

core O

declined O
consecutively O

November B-DATE

2006 I-DATE
, O
indicating O
that O
the O
adjustment O
in O
this O
area O
may O
already O
be O
under O
way O
. O

Just O
like O
the O
stock O
market O
bubble O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
widespread O
public O
opinion O
holds O
that O
any O
damage O
done O
by O
the O
recent O
asset O
bubble O
will O
be O
kept O
within O
the O
U.S. B-NORP
housing O
construction O
industry O
. O

I O
believe O
this O
is O
a O
classic O
example O
of O
not O
learning O
our O
lesson O
. O

The O
Staple O
Commodities O
Cycle O
. O

The O
view O
that O
commodity O
markets O
have O
supercycles O
ran O
into O
a O
serious O
challenge O
in O
2006 B-DATE
. O

Oil O
prices O
slipped O
by O
more B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
25 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
from O
their O
mid-July B-DATE
peak O
and O
the O
price O
of O
natural O
gas O
fell O
by O
more B-PERCENT
than I-PERCENT
30 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
and O
prices O
for O
major O
metals O
like O
copper O
, O
which O
are O
sensitive O
to O
economic O
trends O
, O
showed O
signs O
of O
weakening O
at O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

The O
main O
premise O
of O
the O
supercycle O
theory O
hangs O
on O
an O
extremely O
reliable O
shortage O
of O
staple O
commodities O
; O
this O
shortage O
was O
created O
because O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
20 I-DATE
- I-DATE
odd I-DATE
years I-DATE
there O
has O
been O
a O
shortage O
of O
capital O
to O
invest O
in O
building O
new O
capacity O
for O
acquisition O
and O
processing O
. O

Whereas O
the O
advance O
of O
globalization O
will O
spur O
sources O
of O
new O
demand O
from O
China B-GPE
, O
India B-GPE
and O
other O
commodity O
- O
intensive O
economic O
systems O
, O
asymmetry O
between O
supply O
and O
increasingly O
fierce O
demand O
causes O
exponents O
of O
supercycles O
to O
issue O
the O
highest O
commodity O
price O
forecasts O
in O
history O
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
this O
does O
not O
give O
adequate O
consideration O
to O
latent O
demand O
cycles O
in O
commodity O
markets O
. O

The O
American B-NORP
real O
estate O
market O
shock O
is O
an O
example O
of O
this O
; O
a O
sluggish O
market O
will O
cause O
demand O
for O
many O
materials O
sensitive O
to O
the O
homebuilding O
industry O
to O
drop O
sharply O
. O

However O
, O
the O
real O
demand O
cycle O
may O
depend O
on O
China B-GPE
, O
an O
economic O
system O
that O
accounts O
only O
for O
approximately B-PERCENT
5 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
world O
's O
GDP O
, O
but O
whose O
increased O
consumption O
of O
oil O
and O
key O
metals O
accounted O
for O
fully O
50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
total O
global O
growth O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Influenced O
by O
the O
slowing O
of O
exports O
to O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
combined O
with O
the O
deliberate O
cool O
- O
down O
in O
the O
overheated O
investment O
sector O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
growth O
will O
slow O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

These O
demand O
factors O
will O
be O
adequate O
to O
deliver O
a O
decisive O
blow O
to O
the O
supercycle O
view O
of O
the O
supply O
- O
driven O
commodity O
market O
. O

But O
will O
the O
lessons O
of O
2006 B-DATE
be O
the O
key O
to O
success O
in O
2007 B-DATE
? O

Of O
course O
things O
are O
not O
as O
simple O
as O
that O
. O

We O
can O
undoubtedly O
draw O
some O
important O
lessons O
and O
tips O
from O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
's I-DATE
economy O
, O
but O
there O
is O
another O
important O
thing O
here O
; O
I O
still O
believe O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
main O
engines O
driving O
global O
growth O
will O
slow O
down O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
burst O
real O

bubble O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
the O
cool O
- O
down O
in O
investments O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

Even O
though O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
the O
global O
economy O
is O
in O
for O
a O
hard O
landing O
, O
if O
global O
growth O
slips O
one B-CARDINAL
percentage O
point O
below O
the O
average O
of O
49 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
four I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
I O
will O
not O
think O
it O
unexpected O
. O

My O
greatest O
concern O
is O
that O
people O
continue O
to O
treat O
lightly O
the O
continually O
booming O
risk O
assets O
markets O
; O
they O
include O
high O
- O
yield O
corporate O
bonds O
, O
institutional O
credit O
products O
, O
emerging O
market O
securities O
and O
even O
staple O
commodities O
, O
and O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
the O
next O
bubble O
. O

However O
, O
like O
the O
stock O
and O
real O
estate O
markets O
, O
the O
economy O
tells O
us O
that O
the O
extreme O
case O
of O
the O
asset O
markets O
can O
always O
last O
longer O
than O
we O
anticipate O
, O
particularly O
in O
a O
time O
of O
excess O
current O
capital O
, O
but O
if O
the O
risk O

it O
may O
cause O

According O
to O
a O
BBC B-ORG
report O
on O
the O
nineteenth B-ORDINAL
, O
a O
study O
group O
composed O
of O
American B-NORP
and O
Russian B-NORP
scientists O
recently O
discovered O
several O
kinds O
of O
microbes O
composed O
of O
special O
substances O
. O

Following O
their O
research O
, O
the O
scientists O
made O
a O
bold O
supposition O
: O
that O
some O
of O
the O
earliest O
simple O
life O
forms O
on O
Earth B-LOC
were O
very O
likely O
attached O
to O
meteorites O
from O
Mars B-LOC
that O
came O
to O
Earth B-LOC
. O

In O
their O
research O
, O
the O
American B-NORP
and O
Russian B-NORP
scientists O
discovered O
that O
these O
special O
microbes O
can O
live O
even O
after O
being O
exposed O
to O
radiation O
thousands O
of O
times O
greater O
than O
the O
radiation O
the O
human O
body O
can O
withstand O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
they O
think O
that O
these O
special O
and O
rare O
microbes O
have O
already O
gained O
some O
kind O
of O
ability O
to O
resist O
powerful O
radiation O
while O
maintaining O
moisture O
. O

The O
scientists O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
any O
life O
forms O
originated O
on O
Earth B-LOC
would O
be O
able O
to O
develop O
these O
special O
capabilities O
. O

Because O
there O
is O
evidence O
indicating O
that O
there O
have O
not O
been O
large O
fluctuations O
in O
radiation O
levels O
on O
Earth B-LOC
during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
four I-DATE
billion I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
they O
think O
that O
these O
super-microbes O
could O
have O
originated O
from O
Mars B-LOC
and O
come O
to O
Earth B-LOC
as O
they O
hitched O
a O
ride O
on O
meteorites O
, O
and O
ultimately O
become O
the O
earliest O
simple O
life O
forms O
on O
Earth B-LOC
. O

The O
results O
of O
their O
research O
will O
be O
published O
in O
the O
latest O
edition O
of O
the O
journal O
Astrobiology B-ORG
. O

However O
, O
many O
other O
scientists O
have O
nevertheless O
expressed O
doubts O
on O
this O
. O

Some O
scholars O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
DNA O
of O
these O
super-microbes O
does O
not O
differ O
in O
many O
ways O
from O
regular O
microbes O
. O

Other O
scientists O
have O
also O
pointed O
out O
that O
of O
the B-CARDINAL
tens I-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands I-CARDINAL
of O
meteorites O
already O
found O
on O
Earth B-LOC
, O
only O
twenty B-CARDINAL
or O
so O
came O
from O
Mars B-LOC
. O

Even O
if O
these O
super-microbes O
had O
existed O
on O
Mars B-LOC
, O
the O
possibility O
that O
they O
hitched O
a O
ride O
to O
Earth B-LOC
on O
meteorites O
is O
not O
very O
great O
either O

Analysts O
say O
, O
however O
, O
that O
a O

comes O

the O

that O

say O
are O

But O

He O

In O

. O

yeah O
. O

So O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
mean O
that O
's O
still O
a O
possibility O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
just O
did O
n't O
-- O
yeah O
. O
-- O
feel O
like O
it O
was O
the O
right O
time O
when O
I O
was O
home O
last O
. O

So O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O

I O
saw O
Sayonara O
again O
. O

I O
still O
see O
you O
with O
some O
little O

flying O
around O
going O

. O

The O

. O

No O
. O

Nothing O
like O
that O
going O
on O
over O
here O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
another O
a- O
, O
y- O
. O

Did O
you O
hear O
about O
Martha B-PERSON
getting O
married O
? O

No O
! O

Well O
this O
supposedly O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

Now O
it O
has O
n't O
actually O
happened O
yet O
. O

So O
e- O
we O
may O
be O
at O
ground O
zero O
. O

I O
called O
her O
to O
, O
to O
chat O
whether O
I O
guess O
about B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

%um O
. O
And O
she O
'd O
said O
, O
oh O
, O
hey O
Bill O
. O
By O
the O
way O
, O
I O
'm O
getting O
married O
. O

This O
is O
a O
typical O
Martha B-PERSON
pronouncement O
. O

Ye- O

It O
's O
like O
, O
oh O
, O
okay O
. O

%uh O
, O
you O
know O
, O
e- O
, O
tell O
me O
about O
this O
guy O
. O

How O
long O
have O
you O
known O
him O
and O
all O
that O
. O

oh O
well O
I O
've O
been O
dating O
him O
in O
since B-DATE
April I-DATE

but O
I O
have O
n't O
really O
told O
anybody O
. O

And O
I O
thought O
well O
this O
is O
true O
, O
cause O
Martha B-PERSON
you O
and O
I O
have O
been O
in O
pretty O
good O
touch O
since B-DATE
April I-DATE
, O
and O
you O
never O
mentioned O
it O
. O

But O
this O
guy O
supposedly O
is O
a O
retired O
Marine O
pilot O
. O

%um O
. O

He O
just O
retired O
out O
, O

so O
he O
's O
kind O
of O
thinking O
what O
he O
wants O
to O
do O
now O
. O

I O
think O
for O
some O
reason O
the O
guy O
was O
an O
A O
six B-CARDINAL
driver O
. O

And O
, O
%uh O
, O
it O
seems O
like O
they O
just O
really O
hit O
it O
off O
and O
clicked O
. O

And O
I O
think O
he O
has O
one O
child O
but O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
custody O
. O

%um O
. O
So O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
scoop O
on O
this O
guy O
. O

But O
they O
have O
n't O
set O
a O
date O
or O
anything O
. O

They O
just O
decided O
they O
were O
going O
to O
get O
married O
, O
and O
do O
it O
real O
informal O
and O
all O
this O

and O

I O
know O
. O

So O
. O
I O
asked O
if O
he O
was O
drinking O
buddies O
with O
Luke B-PERSON

and O
that O
did O
n't O
go O
over O
real O
good O
. O

So O
. O
So O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
the O
scoop O
. O

But O
, O
%uh O
, O
she O
's O
still O
in O
San B-GPE
Diego I-GPE
and O
seems O
to O
have O
settled O
pretty O
much O
there O
. O

%uh O
. O
In O
mine O
%uh O
, O
I O
've O
changed O
qui- O
. O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
remember O
. O

Last O
time O
I O
probably O
talked O
to O
you O
was O
what O
, O
last O
spring O
? O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
, O

we O
're O
the O
, O
we O
're O
the O
world O
's O
best O
at O
keeping O
in O
touch O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
on O
the O
road O
now O
moving O
from O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
. O

I O
'm O
finally O
left O
The O
Big O
Easy O
, O

and O
I O
'm O
going O
up O
to O
Vermont B-GPE
, O
believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
for O
graduate O
school O
. O

oh O
, O
you O
are O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
finally O
decided O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
get O
on O
the O
ball O
. O

And O
, O
I O
knew O
I O
wanted O
to O
teach O
English B-LANGUAGE
as O
a O
second O
language O
as O
a O
career O

but O
I O
'd O
never O
really O
done O
anything O
about O
it O
. O

So O
I O
started O
doing O
it O
in O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
as O
a O
private O
tutor O
and O
then O
got O
picked O
up O
by O
a O
little O
private O
school O
down O
there O
to O
teach O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
And O
knew O
this O
was O
what O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O

so O
I O
got O
it O

%uh O
I O
applied O
and O
got O
accepted O
into O
graduate O

up O
in O

up O
there O
kind O
of O
meandering O

States I-GPE

I O
could O
, O
you O

But O
, O
%uh O
, O
they O
picked O

but O
, O
%um O
you O

I O

be O
Barney B-PERSON
. O

oh O
yeah O
. O

Well O
now O

heard O
. O

Now O
I O
think O
I O
heard O
this O
from O
Martha B-PERSON
. O

I O
heard O
Barney O
had O
some O
kind O
of O
terminal O
disease O
. O

Well O
, O
Barney B-PERSON
has O
cancer O
. O

okay O
. O

%uh O
he O
had O
some O
sort O
of O
%uh O
, O
-- O
-- O
%uh O
, O
-- O
-- O
mouth O
and O
throat O
cancer O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
know O
he O
's O
a O
big O
golfer O
. O

Right O

And O
golfers O
tend O
to O
, O
when O
th- O
after O
they O
tee O
off O
they O
stick O
their O
golf O
tee O
in O
their O
mouth O
? O

oh O

. O

yeah O
, O

well O
they O
think O
that O
this O
cancer O
developed O
from O
the O
the O
bug O
spray O
and O
the O
weed O
killer O
that O
they O
put O
on O
the O
the O

know O
he O
had O
gone O
through O
chemo O
, O
and O
was O
in O
the O
process O
of O
getting O

, O
one O
hair O
per O
square O
inch O
on O
his O
head O
. O
yeah O

chuckling O
the O

when O
I O
talked O
to O
Barney B-PERSON
he O

Wow O

point O
blank O

the O
prognosis O
was O
. O

poor O
. O

%um O
, O
but O
he O
did O
n't O
say O
terminal O
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O

okay O
I O
think O
I O
had O
kind O
of O
assumed O
that O
I O
guess O
from O
talking O
to O
Martha B-PERSON
because O
she O
may O
have O
over O
glorified O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
Barney B-PERSON
's O
wife O
Barb B-PERSON
is O
down O
in O
Sansabel B-GPE

mhm O

And O
I O
talk O
to O
her O
fairly O
frequently O

And O
she O
said O
that O
%um O
, O
mhm O
she O
just O
saw O
him O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
mhm O
. O
And O
that O
he O
was O
starting O
to O
gain O
weight O
back O
again O
. O

So O
Super O
. O
You O
know O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
they O
managed O
to O
get O
all O
the O
cancer O
with O
the O
chemo O
and O
the O
radiation O
or O
, O
or O
what O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
%uh O
You O
know O
I O
y- O
I O
knew O
when O
the O
list O
came O
out O

I O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
to O
look O
, O
you O
know O
, O
because O
I O
knew O
that O
both O
Barney B-PERSON
and O
I O
were O
, O
%um O
, O
eligible O
. O
mhm O
Not O
in O

but O
eligible O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
u- O
I O
knew O
of O
anybody O
, O
he O
would O
be O
the O
one O
that O
would O
be O
deep O
selected O
. O

Well O
, O
being O
%uh O
buds O
with O
old O
Chuck B-PERSON
Krulac I-PERSON
did O
n't O
hurt O
things O
a O
whole O
lot O
either O
. O

oh O
no O
. O

Not O
at O
all O
. O

And O
, O
you O
know O
, O
when O
I O
ran O
into O
him O
, O
%uh O
, O
in O
March B-DATE
, O
it O
was O
at O
the O
some O
symposium O
in O
San B-GPE
Diego I-GPE
, O
a O
Nurse B-ORG

thing O
. O

yeah O

And O
, O
%um O
, O
Admiral O
Engel B-PERSON
, O
the O
Nurse B-ORG
Corps I-ORG
admiral O
was O
there O
. O

And O
You O
know O
, O
Barney B-PERSON
knows O
her O
like O
they O
're O
best O
buds O
. O

So O
, O
you O
know O
, O
I O
'm O

No O
more O
new O
pictures O
with O
vice O
president O
sons O
on O
stretchers O
. O

%uh O
, O
no O
, O
not O
yet O
. O

I O
was O
expecting O
to O
see O
him O
taping O
up O
Socks O
or O
Chelsea B-PERSON
any O
day O
now O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
would O
n't O
surprise O

either O
. O

Emergency O
surgeon O
Barney B-PERSON
Berens I-PERSON
flown O

today O
. O

He O
's O
he O
's O
talking O
about O
going O
to O
D O
C O
next O
. O

But O
mhm O
I O
guess O
you O
got O
to O
spend O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
in O
San B-GPE
Diego I-GPE
for O
follow O
up O
. O

yeah O
. O

oh O
. O

And O
then O
, O
%uh O
, O
after O
the O
whole O
episode O
called O
her O
back O
later O
, O

did O
n't O
remember O
it O
ever O
happened O
, O
and O
said O
you O
know O
, O
we O
got O
to O
g- O
got O
to O
get O
together O
sometime O
. O

oh O
jeez O
. O

So O
I O
think O
this O
is O
what O
preempted O
Martha B-PERSON
to O
, O
%uh O
. O

All O
her O
old O
beaus O
are O
definitely O
losing O
it O
. O

I O
think O
it O
prompted O
her O
to O
get O
married O
. O

I O
'm O
trying O
to O
think O
if O
I O
've O
got O
any O
other O
news O

I O
had O
n't O
been O
as O
much O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
other O
folks O
tha- O
know O
Martha B-PERSON
. O

I O
usually O
am O
at O
least O
keeping O
abreast O
of O
things O
. O

I O
think O
Pete B-PERSON
and O
Jennifer B-PERSON
still O
there O

you O
know O
she O
picked O
up O
lieutenant O
commander O

yeah O

I O
s- O
I O
saw O
Jennifer B-PERSON
at O
the O
same O
conference O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

yeah O

Does O
she O
still O
look O
like O
a O
Teutonic B-NORP
%uh O
pin O
- O
up O
? O

mhm O

oh O
man O
. O

Although O
her O
%uh O
hair O
color O
is O
getting O
a O
little O
darker O
. O

oh O
really O
? O

yeah O

she O
's O
not O
%uh O
she O
's O
not O
bleaching O
it O
out O
quite O
as O
much O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
she O
was O
a O

Are O
you O

you O

about O

It O
still O
does O

coughing O
up O
everything O

Still O
, O
despite O
their O
efforts O
to O
convince O
the O
world O
that O
we O
are O
indeed O
alone O
, O
the O
visitors O
do O
seem O
to O
keep O

, O
like O
the O
recent O

, O
there O
's O
often O
a O
detail O
or O
two B-CARDINAL
that O
suggests O
they O
may O
actually O
be O
a O
little O
on O

For O

witnesses O

the O

their O
robot O
friend O
, O
after O
strolling O
around O
the O
city O
park O
, O
left O
behind O
some O
rocks O
. O

Now O
why O
, O
you O
have O
to O
ask O
yourself O
, O
would O
intelligent O
beings O
haul O
a O
bunch O
of O
rocks O
around O
the O

land O

What O
's O
more O
, O
the O
seven B-CARDINAL
mail O
personnel O
aboard O
were O
missing O
. O

Again O
, O
you O
have O
to O
ask O
the O
obvious O
question O
: O
Why O
would O
intelligent O
beings O
kidnap O
seven B-CARDINAL
Soviet B-NORP
mailmen O
? O

the O
flavor O
that O
characterized O
the O

was O
a O

of O
the O

according O
to O
its O

The O
security O

regardless O

their O
denominational O

Iran B-GPE
, O
which O
was O
implicitly O
reminded O
not O
to O

in O
the O
affairs O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
was O
explicitly O
mentioned O
with O

And O
on O

of O
the O

in O

Lebanon B-GPE
, O
the O

to O
the O
constitutional O

of O

condemned O

Concerning O

The O
concluding O
statement O
of O
the B-EVENT

reviewed O
in O

the O
progress O
made O
on O
the O
customs O
union O
and O
the O
steps O
for O
the O
establishment O
of O
the B-ORG
Gulf I-ORG

. O

It O
approved O
allowing O
the O
citizens O
of O
the O
Council O
to O
exercise O
a O
number O
of O
economic O
activities O
. O

Those O
are O
the O
steps O
that O
are O
expected O
to O
complete O
the O
process O
of O
economic O
integration O
, O
which O
is O
what O
all O
the O
peoples O
of O
the O

want O
. O


Now O
you O
have O
also O
begun O
playing O
the O
role O
of O
a O
communication O
bridge O
between O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
of O
them O
. O

Can O
I O
ask O
you O
, O
ah O
, O
which O
part O
acutually O
shows O
Ma B-PERSON
Ying I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
jeou I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
so O
- O
called O
sincerity O
and O
benevolence O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
'll O
explain O
here O
in O
particular O
, O
because O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
communication O
, O
ah O
, O
between O
the O
coalition O
happiness O
has O
actually O
gone O
on O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

And O
Chairman O
Soong B-PERSON
, O
uh O
, O
he O
has O
also O
taken O
into O
consideration O
that O
because O
he O
himself O
is O
a O
candidate O
in O
Taipei B-GPE
, O
in O
the O
future O
it O
might O
not O
be O
convenient O
for O
him O
to O
routinely O
meet O
directly O
with O
Chairman O
Ma B-PERSON
regarding O
certain O
affairs O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
he O
especially O
handed O
over O
to O
me O
the O
role O
of O
representing O
him O
in O
future O
affairs O
between O
the O
two O
parties O
of O
the O
Kuomintang B-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
People I-ORG
First I-ORG
Party I-ORG
, O
and O
to O
represent O
him O
in O
carrying O
out O
direct O
communication O
with O
Chairman O
Ma B-PERSON
. O

Um O
, O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
I O
have O
indeed O
represented O
Chairman O
James B-PERSON
Soong I-PERSON
in O
meeting O
with O
Chairman O
Ma B-PERSON
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
and O
we O
discussed O
many O
issues O
concerning O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
parties O
' O
affairs O
. O

And O
as O
for O
that O
thing O
that O
Chairman O
Ma B-PERSON
wrote O
, O
it O
was O
because O
after O
that O
thing O
-- O
about O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
people O
meeting O
-- O
got O
out O
, O
outsiders O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
doubts O
. O

So O
in O
this O
situation O
, O
he O
was O
also O
particularly O
hoping O
that O
I O
could O
pass O
on O
the O
plan O
the O
two O
of O
them O
had O
for O
future O
development O
of O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
parties O
of O
the O
Kuomintang B-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
People I-ORG
First I-ORG
Party I-ORG
. O

In O
this O
direction O
, O
his O
benevolence O
and O
sincerity O
will O
absolutely O
not O
change O
. O

Okay O
. O


The O

thing O
is O

rural O
issues O

energy O
and O
reducing O
consumption O
, O
protecting O

The O
last O
thing O
a O

is O
that O
his O

not O

him O

Or O
that O

that O

this O
is O

heard O
about O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON

in O
Abu B-GPE

After O
the O
man O
delivered O
his O
address O
at O
the B-EVENT
" I-EVENT
International I-EVENT
Leadership I-EVENT
" I-EVENT
conference I-EVENT
, O
a O
lady O
in O
the O
audience O
stood O
up O
and O
told O
him O
: O
" O
I O
represent O
those O
who O
respect O
America B-GPE
and O
the O
Americans B-NORP
, O
but O
do O
not O
respect O
the O

his O
foreign O
policy O

" O

The O
father O
tried O
to O
defend O
the O
policies O
of O
the O
son O
, O
but O
he O
failed O
. O

He O
criticized O
the O
current O
policy O
indirectly O
when O
he O
said O
that O
when O
he O
launched O
a O
war O
on O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
he O
could O
have O
entered O
Baghdad B-GPE
but O
did O
not O
" O
because O
the O
objective O
was O
to O
liberate O
Kuwait B-GPE
and O
not O
to O
topple O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
. O
" O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
real O
star O
of O
the O
gathering O
was O
not O
Bush O
Sr. O
, O
nor O
Gerhard B-PERSON
Schroeder I-PERSON
, O
the O
former O
German B-NORP
Chancellor O
whom O
we O
met O

heard O
in O
Dubai B-GPE
three B-DATE
years I-DATE

when O
he O
was O
still O
in O
the O

The O
star O
of O
the O

was O
the O
founder O
of O

Singapore B-GPE
, O
Lee B-PERSON
Kuan I-PERSON
Yew I-PERSON
, O
the O
man O
who O
transformed O
a O
small O

a O
few O

a O
few O
languages O
into O
an O
international O
model O
in O
the O

Lee B-PERSON
Kuan I-PERSON
Yew I-PERSON
told O
me O
that O
he O
found O
that O
his O
country O
spoke O
many O
languages O
, O
so O
he O
decided O
that O
the O
first O
step O
is O
for O
people O
to O
communicate O
in O
one O
language O
, O
so O
he O
made O
English B-LANGUAGE
the O
country O
's O
official O
language O
. O

He O
said O
he O
is O
now O
betting O
on O
the O
developing O
world O
and O
the O
new O
economies O
like O
China B-GPE
, O
India B-GPE

Korea B-GPE
. O

He O
added O
that O
Singapore B-GPE
is O
transferring O
its O
investments O
from O
the O
major O
industrial O
countries O
to O
the O
abovementioned O
countries O
. O

He O
said O
capital O
follows O
political O
stability O
wherever O
it O
is O

wherever O

no O

Question O
is O
, O
Why O
? O
Why O
is O
he O
selling O
? O

I O
think O
he O
's O
Begin O
up O
, O
he O
's O
at O
least O
-- O
hedging O
his O
bets O
by O
keeping O
40 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
shares O
but O
basically O
he O
's O
decided O
that O
the O
company O
is O
not O
going O
where O
he O
wants O
it O
to O
go O
and O
he O
's O
bailing O

You O
know O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
concern O
obviously O
by O
people O
who O
still O
own O
the O
stock O
. O

My O
point O
about O
this O
, O
if O
Ted B-PERSON
Turner I-PERSON
were O
so O
smart O
and O
he O
's O
a O
very O
smart O
guy O
but O
he O
did O
not O
sell O
at O
the O
top O
, O
okay O
? O

He O
did O
n't O
sell O
at O
$ O
60 B-MONEY
. O

Hind O
sight O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
have O
gotten O
that O
. O

He O
believed O
in O
the O
merger O
like O
most O
other O
people O
did O
. O

We O
'll O
look O
back O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
from O
now O
, O
you O
can O
see O
, O
he O
has O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

You O
know O
, O
He O
still O
had O
$ B-MONEY
1.7 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
, O
we O
're O
not O
shedding O
tears O
. O

He O
did O
have O
$ B-MONEY
8 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
. O

He O
's O
left O
a O
lot O
on O
the O
table O
. O

We O
'll O
look O
back O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
from O
now O
and O
say O
, O
when O
the O
stock O
is O
either O
at O
$ B-MONEY
13 I-MONEY
still O
or O
$ B-MONEY
8 I-MONEY
or O
$ B-MONEY
30 I-MONEY
and O
say O
, O
he O
was O
either O
very O
smart O
or O
not O
smart O
at O
all O
. O

He O
's O
still O
hedging O
his O
bet O
by O
keeping O
40 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
stake O
. O

I O
hope O
he O
's O
wrong O

Me O
, O
too O

The O
question O
, O
I O

an O
AOL B-ORG

Will O

panic O

everybody O
sell O
it O

think O

be O
weaker O
today B-DATE

Again O
, O
you O
know O

the O

that O

Mr. O

that O

IN O
SIZING O
UP O
the O
risks O
of O
stock O
- O
market O
investments O
, O
there O
's O
probably O
no O
starting O
place O
better O
than O
`` O
beta O
. O
'' O

But O
investors O
better O
not O
ignore O
its O
limitations O
, O
either O
. O

Beta O
is O
a O
handy O
gauge O
that O
measures O
the O
volatility O
of O
a O
stock O
or O
stock O
mutual O
fund O
. O

For O
any O
given O
move O
in O
the O
overall O
market O
, O
it O
suggests O
how O
steeply O
that O
particular O
issue O
might O
rise O
or O
fall O
. O

Beta O
figures O
are O
widely O
available O
and O
easy O
to O
interpret O
. O

The O
beta O
of O
the O
broad O
market O
, O
typically O
defined O
as O
the B-ORG
Standard I-ORG
-AMP- I-ORG
Poor I-ORG
's I-ORG
500-stock B-CARDINAL
index O
, O
is O
always O
1.0 B-CARDINAL
. O

So O
a O
stock O
with O
a O
beta O
of O
0.5 B-CARDINAL
is O
half B-CARDINAL
as O
volatile O
, O
one O
at O
1.5 B-CARDINAL
is O
50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
more O
volatile O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

Cautious O
investors O
should O
generally O
go O
with O
stocks O
that O
have O
low O
betas O
. O

Go O
with O
high O
- O
beta O
stocks O
to O
get O
the O
biggest O
payoff O
from O
a O
bet O
on O
a O
bull O
market O
. O

Remember O
, O
though O
, O
that O
beta O
also O
has O
important O
limitations O
. O

`` O
Beta O
is O
only O
part O

tell O
you O
the O
magnitude O

'' O

In O
particular O
, O
beta O
does O

measure O
the O
company O

industry O
- O
specific O
risk O
associated O

an O

That O

very O

for O
an O

it O

Is O

But O
%uh O

yeah O

so O
the O

oh O

But O
I O
still O
need O

more O
often O
. O

Well O
how O
often O
are O
you O
going O
? O

Only O
four O
days O
a O
week O
. O

. O

yeah O
. O

Got O
to O
get O
that O
up O
to O
five B-CARDINAL
. O

%mm O
. O

But O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
really O
like O
going O
with O
Anne B-PERSON
Marie I-PERSON
because O
she O
does O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
. O

Why O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

She O
kind O
of O
, O

well O
unfortunately O
for O
some O
reason O
she O
's O
not O
like O
into O
cardio O
vascular O
. O

So O
when O
I O
'm O
still O
riding O
the O
bike O
she O
's O
completely O
finished O
her O
weight O
lifting O
e- O
, O
routine O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
like O
I O
have O
n't O
even O
started O
mine O
. O
mhm O
. O
You O
know O

and O
I O
kind O
of O
hinted O
to O
her O
that O
really O
the O
only O
way O
to O
lose O
weight O
is O
cardio O
vascular O
. O
mhm O
. O
It O
's O
true O
. O
And O
that O
lifting O
the O
weights O
wo O
n't O
lose O
weight O
. O

%mm O
%mm O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
lose O
it O
, O
you O
know O
, O

but O

No O

I O
mean O
you O
might O
lose O
some O

but O
that O
's O
only O
when O
yo- O
. O

For O
a O
woman O
who O
is O
lifting O
not O
that O
much O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
yeah O
. O
You O
would O
. O

I O
mean O
yeah O

I O
mean O
the O
only O
thing O
is O
%um O
just O
getting O
your O
heart O
rate O
up O
for O
extended O
periods O
of O
time O
. O

yeah O
, O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

maybe O
she O
'll O
catch O
on O
soon O
. O

You O
do O
burn O
a O
lot O
of O
calories O
an O
hour O
though O
, O
lifting O
weights O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
%uh O

yeah O

I O
mean O
you O
're O
not O
going O
to O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
lose O
that O
much O
. O

n- O
, O
and O
also O
lifting O
weights O
at O
Bally B-FAC
's I-FAC
means O
you O
're O
standing O
on O
line O
as O
for O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
're O
actually O
lifting O
. O

Really O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O
too O
bad O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
it O
's O
is O
it O
really O
overcrowded O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
mean O
obviously O
since O
I O
work O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O

about B-TIME
six I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
at O

which O
is O
when O
everyone O
else O
gets O
there O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

But O
I O
me- O
I O
'm O
sure O
for O
people O
who O
go O
in O
the B-TIME
daytime I-TIME
it O
's O
probably O
dead O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O

and O
I O
go O
%um O
, O
like O
when O
I O
go O
Saturday B-TIME
and I-TIME
Sunday I-TIME
mornings I-TIME
it O
's O
totally O
dead O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O

But O
you O
know O
the B-TIME
weeknights I-TIME
is O
pretty O
crazy O
. O

. O

yeah O

I O
found O
a O
gym O

is O
like O

fifty B-CARDINAL

at O
the O
hospital O
nearby O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
a O
deal O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
uh-huh O
. O
I O
think O
%um O
tonight B-TIME
Charlie B-PERSON
and O
I O
are O
going O
to O
go O
over O
and O
join O
up O
. O

Even O
Charlie B-PERSON
's O
going O
to O
join O
? O

No O
, O

but O
it O
has O
to O
be O
debited O
from O
a O
bank O
account O
so O
it O
's O
got O
to O
be O
debited O
from O
his O
. O

yeah O
. O

In O
your O
letter O
you O
said O
that O
he O
eats O
constantly O
. O

oh O
my O
god O
. O

Really O
? O

Alice B-PERSON
, O
I O
've O
never O
seen O
anybody O
eat O
as O
much O
as O
he O
does O

and O
he O
's O
so O
skinny O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
amount O
of O
cereal O
he O
eats O
like O
between O
meals O
and O
after O
meals O

yeah O
. O

and O
we O
go O
through O
a O
box O
of O
cereal O
every B-DATE
two I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

Really O
? O

yeah O
. O

Wow O
. O

He O
eats O
at O
least O
like O
four B-CARDINAL
of O
cereal O
a O
day O
like O
in O
addition O
to O
like O
meals O
. O

uh-huh O

And O
when O
he O
goes O
to O
work O
he O
brings O
four B-CARDINAL
sandwiches O
with O
him O
, O
uh-huh O
. O
a O
bag O
of O
potato O
chips O
uh-huh O
. O
%um O
and O
you O
know O
and O
then O
little O
sweetie O
things O
chocolates O
and O
**cakies** O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O

uh-huh O

And O
then O
you O
know O
before O
he O
leaves O
every O
morning O
he O
has O
like O
two B-CARDINAL
fried O
eggs O
mhm O
on O
toast O
with O

%um O
vegetarian O

%um O
and O
like O
like O
fruit O

and O
oh O
my O
god O
it O
's O
just O
crazy O
. O

mhm O
. O

It O
's O
crazy O
how O
much O
he O
eats O
. O

He O
was O
probably O
starving O
when O
he O
was O
here O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
what O
we O
got O
to O
do O
is O
just O
when O
he O
comes O
just O
have O
lots O
of O
cereal O
. O

He O
likes O
Cocoa B-PRODUCT
Pops I-PRODUCT
. O

oh O

That O
's O
pretty O
crazy O
. O

yeah O
. O

It O
's O
all O
about O
being O
a O
blue O
collar O
man O
. O

I O
guess O
so O
. O

They O
're O
the O
ones O
who O
can O
eat O
all B-TIME
day I-TIME
. O

Really O
? O

Well O
I O
mean O
he O
does O
work O
his O
ass O
off O

so O

yeah O
. O

But O
%uh O
291.01_291.28_B: O
%hm O
. O

%hm O
. O

So O
, O
I O
, O
I O
assume O
it O
's O
hard O
for O
you O
not O
to O
eat O
as O
much O
as O
he O
does O
. O

No O
. O

I O
learned O
quick O
fast O
in O
a O
hurry O
because O
I O
've O
gained O
so O
much O

week I-DATE
I O
was O

I O
gained O
a O
lot O

so O
. O

's O
hard O
to O
you O
know O
not O
eat O
when O
so- O
, O
when O
somebody O
else O
is O
eating O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
figuring O
it O
out O
fast O
because O
-- O
okay O
-- O
with O
not O
working O
out O
and O
all O
yeah O
. O
it O
's O
pretty O
miserable O
my O
, O
my O
crunch O

. O

%mm O
. O

I O
refused O

got O
mad O
. O

Really O
? O

I O
said O
, O
I O
said O
I O
, O
I O
would O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
going O

I O
was O
not O

mhm O

You O

were O
like O
well O
you O
know O
a O
wedding O
that O
's O
a O
mass O
is O
open O
to O
everyone O
. O

I O
was O
like O
well O
that O
's O
fine O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
I O
would O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
going O

mhm O
. O

I O
think O
that O
would O
be O
obnoxious O

I O
think O
they O
would O
then O
feel O
guilty O
for O
not O
inviting O
me O

Right O
. O

To O
the O
-- O

wo O
n't O

. O

So O
they O
had O
to O
take O

is O
kind O
of O
goofy O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
I O
guess O
she O
did O
that O
to O
, O
because O
someone O
suggested O
that O
to O
her O
because O
you O
know O
the O
lillies O

the O

was O
that O
we O
should O
choose O

the O

that O

, O
as O

as O

from O

we O

supported O
locating O
the O

it O
in O

will O
not O

will O

Since O

We O
thought O

it O

Israel B-GPE
in O
general O
do- O
Israelis B-NORP
do O
n't O
eat O
that O
much O
meat O
anyway O

it O
's O
more O
we O
eat O
fruit O
vegetables O
an- O
yeah O
yeah O
stuff O

nobody O
really O
eats O
steaks O
anymore O

like O
I O
I O
grew O
up O
on O
steaks O
all O
the O
time O
from O
Sam B-ORG
's I-ORG
Supermarket I-ORG
every O
you O
know O
all O
the O

yeah O

from O
Sam O
's O
Supermark- O

uh-huh O

yeah O

I O
jeez O
%uh O
the O
last O
time O
he O
had O
a O
steak O
was O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
months O
ago O

we O
do O
n't O
even O
eat O
steaks O
anymore O

but O
duh O
%eh O
in O
America B-GPE
too O
they O
do O
n't O
eat O
as O
much O
do O
they O

%uh O
no O

because O
for O
heart O
the O
fat O
is O
supposed O
by O
very O
bad O

yes O

Hello O

oh O
yeah O

yeah O

you O
said O
people O
are O
not O

no O

the O
red O
meat O
is O
suffering O
I O
guess O

I O
noticed O
that O
last O
time O
I O
was O
home O

but O
y- O
but O
I O
do O
n't O
eat O
any O
either O

so O

yeah O

I O
know O
it O
's O
not O
a O
good O
idea O

I O
I O
'm O
I O

but O
Canada O
does O
n't O
use O
that O
junk O

I O
mean O
and O
they O
tell O
us O
I O
think O
Europe B-GPE
does O
n't O
us- O
wo O
n't O
buy O
from O
us O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
that O
the O
hormones O
with O
s- O
stuff O
in O
it O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
know O

I O
know O

it O
's O
%uh O

and O
but O
we O
're O
using O
it O
naturally O

Well O

so O
everything O
you O
kn- O

it O
makes O
I O
tell O
you O
it O
breaks O
my O
heart O
when O
I O
see O
them O
following O
that O

they O
think O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
is O
so O
everything O
is O
so O
wonderful O

if O
there O
's O
some O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
know O

they O
take O
they O
take O
the O
good O
and O
the O
bad O
all O
the O

and O
that O
's O
t- O

yeah O

oh O
it O
's O
pitiful O

that O
makes O
me O
very O
very O
sad O

you O
know O
oh O
it O
's O
%eh O

very O
sad O

an- O
and O
even O
the O
Russians B-NORP
the- O
they O
come O
over O

and O
I O
know O
I O
can O
see O
the O
attitude O
%ah O
well O
that O
of O
course O
they O
know O
for O
ins- O

Ira O
is O
now O
%um O
like O
a O
adv- O
he O
's O
working O
in O
a O
local O
in O
a O
neighborhood O
association O
like O
on O
on O
f- O
on O
on O
funds O

yeah O

yeah O

on O
grants O

he O
does O
a O
wonderful O
job O

and O
they O
help O
him O

oh O
I O
think O
I O
think O
he O
was O
n't O
working O
when O
Holly B-PERSON
was O
here O

I O
think O
he O
was O
n't O
working O

he O
's O
was O
n't O
working O
over B-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
yeah O
oh O
that O
's O
good O
that O
he O
three B-DATE
and I-DATE
half I-DATE
years I-DATE

but O
this O
is O
parttime O

but O
it O
's O
very O
involving O

it O
's O
very O
exciting O

oh O
that O
's O
nice O

and O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
people O
line O
up O
to O
see O
him O

and O
it O
's O
about O
food O
s- O
getting O
help O
with O
housing O
and O
food O
stamps O
and O
everything O

yeah O

and O
a O
lady O
said O
you O
know O
my O
husband O
died O
and O
old O
l- O
and O
old O
lady O

I O
said O
oh O
I O
'm O
sorry O

she O
says O
I O
s- O
really O
thought O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
that O
you O
do O
n't O
die O
she O
sa- O
you O
know O

but O
and O
I O
knew O
that O
underlying O
it O
they O
really O
believe O
that O
because O
if O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O

yeah O

they O
know O
every- O
they O
know O
everyone O
dies O

but O
underneath O
they O
feel O
maybe O
maybe O
you O
do O
n't O
die O
until O
you O
're O
very O
very O
old O

but O
they O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
so O
many O
people O
die O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
because O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O

oh O
wow O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
they O
got O
that O
idea O
from O

yeah O

but O
you O
see O
how O
it O
is O

jeez O

so O
everybody O
has O
these O
wrong O
conceptions O

I O
know O

I O
know O
%eh O

%eh O
it O
's O
%uh O
it O
's O
%uh O
pitiful O

but O

Well O
so O
originally O
he O

the O
army O

they O
got O
married O

he O
he O
graduated O
Cornell B-ORG
agricultural O

had O
to O
be O
a O
farmer O

so O
about O
maybe O
two B-CARDINAL
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
many O
years O
they O
had O
a O
dairy O
farm O

and O
you O
know O
how O
rough O

they O
could O
n't O
go O
they O
were O
slaves O

they O
could O
n't O
go O
anywhere O
do O
anything O

yeah O

they O
had O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
farm O
because O
it O
's O
a O
small O
you O
know O

I O
do O
n't O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
any O
of O
this O

yeah O

but O
that O
's O
a O
lot O
like O
you O

you O
're O
much O
younger O

I O
was O

fifty B-CARDINAL

oh O
so O
you O
're O
much O

I O
'm O
born O

nineteen B-DATE
thirty I-DATE
nine I-DATE

so O
you O
're O

in O
nineteen B-DATE
fifty I-DATE

yeah O

yeah O

there O
's O
a O
difference O

yeah O

Yes O

so O
it O

way O
before O
you O
they O

about O
maybe O
before O
you O
were O
born O

yes O

yeah O

could O
b- O

and O
and O
or O
or O
just O
about O
the O
time O
you O
were O
born O
they O
left O
Hudson B-GPE

yeah O

not O

So O
then O
they O
went O

Middletow- O

and O
he O
was O
the O
%um O
then O
he O
came O
he O
was O
the O
%um O
for O
the O
girls O
' O

he O
became O

since O
he O
did O
n't O

could O
n't O
be O

yeah O

he O
became O

he O
had O
been O
a O
captain O
in O

So O
that O
he O
got O

he O
oh O
go- O
he O
got O
a O

he O
be- O
g- O
got O
into O

it O
confirmed O
its O
position O

I O

Mexicans B-NORP
were O
voting O
for O
change O
on O
election B-DATE
Day I-DATE
, O
no O
doubt O
about O
it O
, O
but O
it O
is O
also O
clear O
Mexicans B-NORP
were O
voting O
for O
a O
man O
who O
has O
charmed O
and O
fascinated O
them O
, O
who O
has O
become O
their O
political O
Messiah O

Fox B-PERSON
comes O
from O
a O
farming O

His O
grandfather O
was O
an O
Irishman B-NORP
, O
but O
as O
a O
young O
man O
, O
Fox B-PERSON
left O
the O
fields O
to O
work O
for O
the B-ORG
Coca I-ORG

Ten B-DATE

I O
was O

How O
do O
you O

in O
ten B-DATE

when O
you O
start O
at O
the B-DATE
age I-DATE
of I-DATE
22 I-DATE
? O

Working O
hard O
, O
working O
hard O
, O
man O
. O

But O
it O
will O
clearly O
take O
much O
more O
than O
hard O
work O
to O
make O
changes O
that O
will O
affect O
not O
only O
Mexico B-GPE
but O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

He O
says O
he O
will O
drive O
out O
the O
drug O
traffickers O
. O

He O
promised O
to O
reduce O
poverty O
, O
which O
could O
mean O
an O
open O
border O
with O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
since O
fewer O
Mexicans B-NORP
would O
want O
to O
cross O
over O
for O
jobs O
. O

He O
's O
even O
promised O
to O
stamp O
out O
corruption O
. O

Corruption O
is O
the O
evil O
of O
all O
evils O
. O

When O
you O
were O
campaigning O
, O
you O
called O
the O
opposition O
, O
the O

, O
`` O
blood O
suckers O

`` O

Do O
you O
mean O
that O
? O

I O
am O
inviting O
them O
to O
govern O
with O
them O
together O
. O

But O
why O
should O
they O
help O
you O
? O

You O
beat O
them O
. O

You O
destroyed O
their O
power O
base O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
'm O
sure O
in O
their O
heart O
they O
still O
love O
Mexico B-GPE
. O

Many O
people O
here O
believe O
Fox B-PERSON
is O
naive O
. O

The O
danger O
is O
probably O
he O
can O
not O
deliver O
the O
promises O
that O
he O
made O
during O
the O
campaign O

what O
do O
you O
think O
Vincente B-PERSON
Fox I-PERSON
will O
do O
? O

Nobody O

the O
legal O
maneuvering O
he O
is O
calling O
on O
both O
camps O
to O
put O
partisan O
politics O
aside O

I O
think O
that O
both O
Governor O

I O
should O
recognize O
an O
obligation O
during O
this O
time O
when O
the O

still O
to O
be O
counted O
, O
to O
try O
to O
restrain O
the O

. O

Meanwhile O
, O
Bush B-PERSON

vice O
presidential O

Dick B-PERSON
Cheney I-PERSON
was O
a O
busy O
man O
today B-DATE
. O

After O
a O
heart O
checkup O
at O
a O
Washington B-GPE

he O
appeared O
at O
a O
news O
conference O
to O
say O
that O
he O
is O
pressing O
ahead O
with O
transition O

. O

We O
have O
now O
acquired O
office O
space O
in O
McClain B-GPE
, O
Virginia B-GPE
that O
will O
become O
the O
site O
for O
the O
transition O
operation O
that O
we O
announced O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
so O
we O
are O
just O
in O
a O
business O
of O
getting O
up O
and O
running O
, O
but O
we O
now O
have O
an O
office O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
. O

We O
have O
got O
people O
signing O
up O
, O
volunteers O
coming O
on O

being O
put O

so O
we O
will O
be O
fully O
operational O
within O
the B-DATE

Earlier B-TIME
today I-TIME
in O
Florida B-GPE
, O
the O

special O

to O
pick O
the O

, O
should O
the O

find O
the O

tied O
up O

. O

The O
committee O
heard O
from O
angry O
voters O
and O
precinct O
workers O
in O
Palm B-GPE
Beach I-GPE
. O

I O
believe O
our O
issues O
do O
relate O
directly O
to O
the O
appointing O
of O
electors O
for O
the O
state O
of O
Florida B-GPE
. O

The O
electors O
need O
to O
be O
appointed O
, O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
appointed O
according O
to O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
and O
I O
believe O
in O
Palm B-GPE
Beach I-GPE
County I-GPE
that O
it O
was O
very O
difficult O
to O
determine O
what O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
was O
. O

Although O
Al B-PERSON
Gore I-PERSON
said O
today B-DATE
that O
he O
certainly O
feels O
like O
he O
won O
the O
election O
, O
he O
put O
his O
odds O
of O
wining O
the O
various O
legal O
battles O
at O
fifty B-CARDINAL
- O
fifty B-CARDINAL
. O

Gore B-PERSON
said O
, O
if O
Bush B-PERSON
does O
triumph O
in O
court O
, O
he O
will O
throw O
his O
support O
behind O
the O
Republican B-NORP
President O
- O
elect O
. O

But O
for O
now O
, O
says O
former O
Clinton B-PERSON
administration O
cabinet O
member O
Robert B-PERSON
Riche I-PERSON
, O
both O
sides O
are O
positive O
that O
they O
've O
won O
the O
election O
, O
and O
says O
Riche B-PERSON
, O
the O
longer O
the O
fight O
goes O
on O
, O
the O
more O
troublesome O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
four I-DATE
years I-DATE
might O
be O
. O

What O
we O
risk O
by O
prolonging O
this O
is O
greater O
public O
cynicism O
and O
a O
hardening O
of O
partisan O
lines O
among O
career O
politicians O
who O
have O
to O
work O
together O
. O

After O
all O
, O
come O
January B-DATE
, O
these O
people O
are O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
in O
Washington B-GPE
whether O

You O

work O

we O

Among O
these O

what O
do O
you O
appreciate O
most O

This O

it O
is O
too O
difficult O
to O

I O
think O
I O
should O
say O
maybe O
it O
's O
the O
next O

ah O
-- O

The O
next O
program O
. O

Then O
, O
from O
these O
programs O
that O
we O
've O
seen O
, O
for O
instance O
from O
the O
surface O
, O
like O
the O
dragon O
dance O
, O
uh O
, O
it O
is O
easy O
and O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
understand O
much O
about O
it O
, O
or O
like O
the O
fan O
dance O
, O
ah O
, O
or O
bowls O
- O
balancing O
dance O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
's O
a O
completely O
beautiful O
thing O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
artistic O
expression O
. O

Then O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
eh O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
program O
about O
Yue B-PERSON
Fei I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
total O
dedication O
to O
his O
country O
, O
uh O
, O
and O
the O
words O
his O
mother O
etched O
on O
him O
. O

Yes O
, O
yes O
. O

Then O
, O
if O
these O
children O
do O
not O
know O
Chinese B-NORP
history O
very O
well O
, O
do O
you O
think O
they O
can O
understand O
the O
program O
. O

Eh O
, O
through O
the O
form O
of O
theatrical O
performances O
, O
it O
is O
still O
quite O
popular O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
if O
for O
instance O
it O
is O
about O
telling O
a O
story O
, O
eh O
, O
then O
perhaps O
they O
may O
not O
have O
any O
perceptual O
understanding O
of O
it O
, O
oh O
. O

I O
remember O
an O
example O
just O
like O
this O
from O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Eh O
, O
after O
some O
children O
watched O
the O
program O
, O
they O
said O
, O
oh O
, O
the O
story O
this O
my O
parents O
told O
me O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
is O
actually O
like O
this O
. O

He O
can O
actually O
feel O
it O
, O
after O
all O
, O
his O
story O
has O
become O
three B-QUANTITY
- O
dimensional O
. O

If O
it O
's O
simply O
a O
story O
, O
they O
probably O
can O
not O
remember O
after O
listening O
to O
it O
. O

Eh O
, O
I O
think O
there O
are O
one B-QUANTITY
or O
two B-QUANTITY
programs O
like O
this O
in O
each O
performance O
, O
and O
it O
is O
very O

in O
the O
stock O
's O
price O
. O

But O
most O
investment O
advisers O
do O
n't O
recommend O
using O
married O
puts O
all O
the O
time O
. O

That O
's O
because O
the O
cost O
of O
buying O
put O
options O
eats O
into O
an O
investor O
's O
profit O
when O
stock O
prices O
rise O
. O

`` O
This O
is O
the O
type O
of O
fire O
insurance O
you O
only O
buy O
when O
the O
nearby O
woods O
are O
on O
fire O
, O
'' O
says O
Mr. O
Roth B-PERSON
. O

`` O
You O
always O
want O
your O
house O
insured O
, O
but O
you O
do O
n't O
always O
feel O
the O
need O
for O
your O

to O
be O
insured O
. O
'' O

In O
addition O
to O
hedging O
new O
stock O
purchases O
, O
the O
married O
- O
put O
technique O
can O
be O
used O
to O
protect O
stocks O
that O
an O
investor O
already O
owns O
. O

In O
either O
case O
, O
the O
investor O
faces O
three B-CARDINAL
possible O
outcomes O
: O

-- O
If O
the O
stock O
goes O
up O
in O
price O
between B-DATE
now I-DATE
and I-DATE
the I-DATE
put I-DATE
's I-DATE
expiration I-DATE
date I-DATE
, O
the O
put O
will O
probably O
expire O
worthless O
. O

The O
investor O
will O
be O
out O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
put O
, O
which O
is O
called O
the O
`` O
premium O
, O
'' O
and O
this O
loss O
will O
reduce O
the O
stock O
- O
market O
profit O
. O

-- O
If O
the O
stock O
stays O
at O
the O
same O
price O
between B-DATE
now I-DATE
and I-DATE
the I-DATE
put I-DATE
's I-DATE
expiration I-DATE
date I-DATE
, O
the O
investor O
's O
loss O
will O
be O
limited O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
put O
, O
less O
any O
amount O
realized O
from O
a O
closing O
sale O
of O
the O
put O
. O

The O
worst O
- O
case O
scenario O
would O
be O
if O
the O
put O
expires O
worthless O
. O

-- O
If O
the O
price O
of O
the O
stock O
declines O
, O
the O
put O
will O
increase O
in O
value O
. O

Once O
the O
stock O
price O
is O
less O
than O
the O
exercise O
price O
, O
or O
`` O
strike O
price O
, O
'' O
of O
the O
put O
, O
the O
gain O
will O
match O
the O
loss O
on O
the O
stock O
dollar O
for O
dollar O
. O

The O
put O
establishes O
a O
minimum O
selling O
price O
for O
the O
stock O
during O
its O
life O
. O

When O
a O
stock O
falls O
below O
the O
put O
's O
strike O
price O
, O
the O
investor O
simply O
sells O
the O
stock O
at O
a O
loss O
and O
simultaneously O
sells O
the O
put O
at O
a O
profit O
. O

Or O
, O
the O
investor O
can O
exercise O
the O
put O
, O
by O
tendering O
the O
stock O
to O
his O
or O
her O
broker O
in O
return O
for O
payment O
from O
another O
investor O
who O
has O
sold O
a O
put O
on O
the O
same O
stock O
. O

Brokers O
handle O
such O
transactions O
through O
the B-ORG
Options I-ORG
Clearing I-ORG
Corp. I-ORG
, O
which O
guarantees O
all O
option O
trades O
. O

The O
accompanying O
table O
shows O
how O
this O
strategy O
would O
work O
for O
three B-CARDINAL
stocks O
. O

Though O
not O
reflected O
in O
the O
table O
, O
an O
investor O
should O
know O
that O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
option O
insurance O
can O
be O
partially O
offset O
by O
any O
dividends O
that O
the O
stock O
pays O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Tenneco B-ORG
Inc. I-ORG
pays O
a O
quarterly B-DATE
dividend O
of O
76 B-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
, O
which O
would O
be O
received O
before O
the O
February B-DATE
option O
expires O
and O
, O
thus O
, O
reduce O
the O
cost O
of O
using O
the O
technique O
by O
that O
amount O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
investor O
's O
risk O
would O
n't O
exceed O
3.6 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
total O
investment O
. O

To O
simplify O
the O
calculations O
, O
commissions O
on O
the O
option O
and O
underlying O
stock O
are O
n't O
included O
in O
the O
table O
. O

There O
are O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
650 I-CARDINAL
stocks O
on O
which O
options O
may O
be O
bought O
and O
sold O
, O
including O
some O
over O
- O
the O
- O
counter O
stocks O
. O

But O
some O
investors O
might O
prefer O
a O
simpler O
strategy O
then O
hedging O
their O
individual O
holdings O
. O

They O
can O
do O
this O
by O
purchasing O
`` O
index O
puts O
, O
'' O
which O
are O
simply O
put O
options O
on O
indexes O
that O
match O
broad O
baskets O
of O
stocks O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the O
most O
popular O
index O
option O
is O
the O
S-AMP-P O
100 O
option O
, O
commonly O
called O
the O
OEX O
. O

It O
is O
based O
on O
the O
stocks O
that O
make O
up O
Standard B-ORG
-AMP- I-ORG
Poor I-ORG
's I-ORG
100-stock B-CARDINAL
index O
. O

Unlike O
options O
on O
individual O
issues O
, O
index O
options O
are O
settled O
only O
in O
cash O
, O
and O
no O
stock O
is O
ever O
tendered O
. O

But O
while O
index O
options O
are O
convenient O
, O
they O
have O
several O
disadvantages O
. O

For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
an O
investor O
's O
portfolio O
might O
not O
closely O
match O
the O
S-AMP-P O
100 O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
OEX O
insurance O
may O
or O
may O
not O
fully O
protect O
an O
investor O
's O
holdings O
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
market O
decline O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
OEX O
options O
were O
suspended O
from O
trading O
last B-DATE
Friday I-DATE
afternoon B-TIME
, O
after O
the O
stock O
- O
market O
sell O
- O
off O
got O
under O
way O
and O
trading O
in O
the O
S-AMP-P O
- O
500 O
futures O
contract O
was O
halted O
. O

So O
an O
investor O
who O
wanted O
to O
realize O
a O
profit O
on O
OEX O
puts O
after O
the O
trading O
suspension O
would O
have O
been O
out O
of O
luck O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
only O
a O
handful O
of O
individual O
issues O
were O
suspended O
from O
trading O
on O
Friday B-DATE
. O

Normally O
, O
once O
the O
underlying O
investment O
is O
suspended O
from O
trading O
, O
the O
options O
on O
those O
investments O
also O
do O
n't O
trade O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
whether O
the O
insurance O
provided O
by O
purchasing O
puts O
is O
worthwhile O
depends O
on O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
options O
. O

That O
cost O
rises O
in O
times O
of O
high O
market O
volatility O
. O

But O
it O
still O
might O
be O
cheaper O
than O
taking O
a O
major O
hit O
. O

The O
protection O
from O
using O
married O
puts O
is O
clearly O
superior O
to O
that O
afforded O
by O
another O
options O
strategy O
some O
investors O
consider O
using O
during O
troubled O
times O
: O
selling O
call O
options O
on O
stocks O
the O
investor O
owns O
. O

A O
call O
option O
is O
similar O
to O
a O
put O
, O
except O
that O
it O
gives O
its O
owner O
the O
right O
to O
buy O
shares O
at O
a O
stated O
price O
until O
expiration O
. O

Selling O
a O
call O
option O
gives O
an O
investor O
a O
small O
buffer O
against O
a O
stock O
- O
market O
decline O
. O

That O
's O
because O
it O
reduces O
the O
cost O
of O
the O
stock O
by O
the O
amount O
of O
premium O
received O
from O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
call O
. O

But O
if O
the O
price O
of O
the O
stock O
rises O
above O
the O
strike O
price O
of O
the O
option O
, O
the O
stock O
is O
almost O
certain O
to O
be O
called O
away O
. O

And O
in O
that O
case O
, O
the O
investor O
misses O
out O
on O
any O
major O
upside O
gain O
. O

These O
calculations O
exclude O
the O
effect O
of O
commissions O
paid O
and O
dividends O
received O
from O
the O
stock O
. O

All O
prices O
are O
as O
of O

of O
her O
audiences O
. O

For O
Ms. O
Bogart B-PERSON
, O
who O
initially O
studied O
and O
directed O
in O
Germany B-GPE
-LRB- O
and O
cites O
such O
European B-NORP
directors O
as O
Peter B-PERSON
Stein I-PERSON
, O
Giorgio B-PERSON
Strehler I-PERSON
and O
Ariane B-PERSON
Mnouchkine I-PERSON
as O
influences O
-RRB- O
tends O
to O
stage O
her O
productions O
with O
a O
Brechtian O
rigor O
-- O
whether O
the O
text O
demands O
it O
or O
not O
. O

And O
Gorky B-PERSON
, O
considered O
the O
father O
of O
Soviet B-NORP
socialist O
realism O
, O
did O
not O
write O
plays O
that O
easily O
lend O
themselves O
to O
deliberately O
antirealistic O
distancing O
techniques O
. O

Gorky B-PERSON
was O
a O
loyal O
if O
occasionally O
ambivalent O
proletarian O
writer O
committed O
to O
enlightening O
the O
masses O
with O
plain O
speaking O
rooted O
in O
a O
slightly O
sour O
version O
of O
Chekhovian B-NORP
humanism O
. O

And O
`` O
Summerfolk B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
'' O
penned O
in O
1904 B-DATE
as O
a O
kind O
of O
sequel O
to O
Chekhov B-PERSON
's O
`` O
Cherry B-WORK_OF_ART
Orchard I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
'' O
is O
a O
lawn O
party O
of O
Russian B-NORP
yuppies O
engaged O
in O
an O
exhausting O
ideological O
fight O
to O
the O
finish O
between O
the O
allrightniks O
and O
the O
reformers O
. O

Along O
the O
way O
there O
also O
are O
lots O
of O
romantic O
dalliances O
. O

Wisely O
Ms. O
Bogart B-PERSON
has O
kept O
Gorky B-PERSON
's O
time O
and O
place O
intact O
. O

Despite O
the O
absence O
of O
samovars O
-LRB- O
and O
a O
tendency O
to O
turn O
the O
furniture O
upside O
down O
-RRB- O
, O
the O
production O
is O
rich O
in O
Russian B-NORP
ennui O
voiced O
by O
languorous O
folk O
sporting O
beige O
linen O
and O
rumpled O
cotton O
, O
with O
boaters O
and O
fishing O
poles O
aplenty O
. O

But O
beyond O
this O
decorative O
nod O
to O
tradition O
, O
Ms. O
Bogart B-PERSON
and O
company O
head O
off O
in O
a O
stylistic O
direction O
that O
all O
but O
transforms O
Gorky B-PERSON
's O
naturalistic O
drama O
into O
something O
akin O
to O
, O
well O
, O
farce O
. O

The O
director O
's O
attempt O
to O
force O
some O
Brechtian O
distance O
between O
her O
actors O
and O
their O
characters O
frequently O
backfires O
with O
performances O
that O
are O
unduly O
mannered O
. O

Not O
only O
do O
the O
actors O
stand O
outside O
their O
characters O
and O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
are O
at O
odds O
with O
them O
, O
but O
they O
often O
literally O
stand O
on O
their O
heads O
. O

Like O
Peter B-PERSON
Sellars I-PERSON
, O
Ms. O
Bogart B-PERSON
manipulates O
her O
actors O
as O
if O
they O
were O
rag O
dolls O
, O
sprawling O
them O
on O
staircases O
, O
dangling O
them O
off O
tables O
, O
even O
hanging O
them O
from O
precipices O
while O
having O
them O
perform O
some O
gymnastic O
feats O
of O
derring O
- O
do O
. O

There O
are O
moments O
in O
this O
`` O
Summerfolk B-WORK_OF_ART
'' O
when O
the O
characters O
populating O
the O
vast O
multilevel O
country O
house O
-LRB- O
which O
looks O
like O
a O
parody O
of O
Frank B-PERSON
Lloyd I-PERSON
Wright I-PERSON
and O
is O
designed O
by O
Victoria B-PERSON
Petrovich I-PERSON
-RRB- O
spout O
philosophic O
bon O
mots O
with O
the O
self O
- O
conscious O
rat O

a O

pacing O
of O
`` O

In I-WORK_OF_ART
. O
'' O

`` O
Talk O
hurts O
from O
where O
it O
spurts O
, O
'' O
one O
of O
them O
says O
. O

The O
clash O
of O
ideologies O
survives O
this O
treatment O
, O
but O
the O
nuance O
and O
richness O
of O
Gorky B-PERSON
's O
individual O
characters O
have O
vanished O
in O
the O
scuffle O
. O

As O
for O
the O
humor O
that O
Gorky B-PERSON
's O
text O
provides O
, O
when O
repainted O
in O
such O
broad O
strokes O
-LRB- O
particularly O
by O
the O
lesser O
members O
of O
the O
ensemble O
-RRB- O
it O
looks O
and O
sounds O
forced O
. O

Ms. O
Bogart B-PERSON
does O
better O
with O
music O
than O
with O
words O
when O
she O
wants O
, O
as O
she O
so O
often O
does O
want O
, O
to O
express O
herself O
through O
Gorky B-PERSON
's O
helpless O
play O
. O

Here O
she O
has O
the O
aid O
of O
her O
longtime O
associate O
Jeff B-PERSON
Helpern I-PERSON
, O
whom O
she O
appointed O
Trinity B-ORG
's O
first B-ORDINAL
- O
ever O
musical O
director O
and O
whom O
she O
equipped O
with O
a O
spanking O
new O
$ O
60,000 B-MONEY
sound O
system O
and O
recording O
studio O
. O

For O
Gorky B-PERSON
, O
Mr. O
Helpern B-PERSON
provided O
an O
aural O
collage O
of O
Debussy B-PERSON
and O
Rachmaninoff B-PERSON
, O
which O
is O
less O
a O
score O
than O
a O
separate O
character O
with O
a O
distinct O
point O
of O
view O
. O

Like O
Brecht B-PERSON
, O
and O
indeed O
Ezra B-PERSON
Pound I-PERSON
, O
Ms. O
Bogart B-PERSON
has O
said O
that O
her O
intent O
in O
such O
manipulative O
staging O
of O
the O
classics O
is O
simply O
an O
attempt O
to O
`` O
make O
it O
new O
. O
'' O

Indeed O
, O
during O
a O
recent O
post-production O
audience O
discussion O
, O
the O
director O
explained O
that O
her O
fondest O
artistic O
wish O
was O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
play O
`` O
Somewhere B-WORK_OF_ART
Over I-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Rainbow I-WORK_OF_ART
'' O
so O
that O
the O
song O
's O
`` O
original O
beauty O
comes O
through O
, O
'' O
surmounting O
the O
cliche O
. O

The O
danger O
that O
Ms. O
Bogart B-PERSON
seems O
to O
be O
courting O
here O
is O
one O
of O
obfuscation O
rather O
than O
rejuvenation O
, O
a O
vision O
so O
at O
odds O
with O
the O
playwright O
's O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
points O
of O
view O
nullify O
, O
rather O
than O
illuminate O
, O
each O
other O
. O

Ms. O
Bogart B-PERSON
's O
cast O
is O
part O
and O
parcel O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

Ed B-PERSON
Shea I-PERSON

Barbara B-PERSON
Orson I-PERSON

a O

Cynthia B-PERSON

the O

Chang B-PERSON

both O
for O
Taiwan B-GPE
and O
China B-GPE

In O
his O

Chang B-PERSON
describes O
himself O
as O
a O
" O
Yam O

" O
which O
is O
an O
allusion O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE

Chang B-PERSON
explains O
that O
he O
was O
actually O
born O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
though O
his O
father O

family O
was O
indeed O
from O
Taiwan B-GPE

After O
Taiwan B-GPE
was O
returned O
to O
Chinese B-NORP
rule O
, O
Chang B-PERSON
returned O
to O
the O
land O
of O
his O
roots O
. O

Studying O
at O
Chienkuo B-ORG
High I-ORG
in O
1949 B-DATE
, O
he O
was O
arrested O
on O
false O
charges O
of O
having O
participated O
in O
the B-EVENT
April I-EVENT

. O

He O
spent O
nearly O
a O

in O

before O
taking O
the O
high O
school O
equivalency O
exam O
and O
going O
on O

study O
archeology O
at O
NTU B-ORG

After O
earning O
his O
doctorate O
at O
Harvard B-ORG
, O
he O
took O
an O
academic O
post O
in O
America B-GPE
but O
always O
maintained O
his O
focus O
on O
Chinese B-NORP
archeology O
. O

Largely O
due O
to O
his O
unflagging O
efforts O
, O
Chinese B-NORP
archeology O
attained O
a O
sturdy O
theoretical O
and O
practical O
foundation O
that O
enabled O
it O
to O
emerge O
as O
a O
world-class O
discipline O
. O

His O
research O
showed O
that O
the O
rise O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
civilization O
did O
not O
occur O
exclusively O
in O
the O
area O
around O
the B-LOC
Yellow I-LOC
River I-LOC
Valley I-LOC
. O

Rather O
it O
emerged O
from O
several O
languages O
, O
ethnic O
groups O
and O
cultures O
spread O
over O
a O
vast O
landscape O
. O

This O
overturned O
the O
" O
single O
origin O
theory O
" O
and O
debunked O
Western B-NORP
assumptions O
about O
" O
oriental O
despotism O

" O

Though O
a O
world-class O
scholar O
, O
Chang B-PERSON
never O
forgot O
the O
land O
of O
his O
origins O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
1960s I-DATE
, O
he O
returned O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
and O
embarked O
on O
research O
at O
the O
Fengpitou B-LOC
site O
in O
Kaohsiung B-GPE
, O
completing O
the O
most O
extensive O
archeological O
study O
made O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
over O
a O
century B-DATE
. O

Then O
he O
went O
on O
to O
perform O
research O
in O
an O
area O
that O
spanned O
the O
Choshui B-LOC
and O
Tatu B-LOC
river O
valleys O
. O

It O
was O
a O
huge O
undertaking O
that O
involved O
both O
archeology O
and O
geology O
. O

Many O
of O
the O
leading O
lights O
among O
the O
younger O
generation O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
anthropologists O
cut O
their O
research O
teeth O
on O
this O
project O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
Chang B-PERSON
Kwang-chih I-PERSON
became O
afflicted O
with O
Parkinson B-PERSON

disease O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
a I-DATE

His O
limbs O
started O
to O
shake O
, O
and O
it O
became O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
perform O
fieldwork O
. O

Chang B-PERSON
deeply O
regretted O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
examine O
the O
Shangqiu B-LOC
site O
in O
eastern O
Henan B-GPE
. O

Though O
sick O
, O
Chang B-PERSON
returned O

the O
end O
of O
his O
life O
to O
serve O
as O

Finally O
there O
was O
the O
death O
of O
the O
historian O
Tai B-PERSON
Kuo-hui I-PERSON

who O
served O
on O
the B-ORG

was O
admired O
as O
much O
for O
his O

for O
his O
pioneering O
work O
in O
Taiwanese B-NORP
history O

His O
differences O

opinion O
with O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng-hui I-PERSON
had O
thrust O
him O
into O
the O
spotlight O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE

Born O
in O
1931 B-DATE
in O
Taoyuan B-GPE
, O
Tai B-PERSON
was O
educated O
under O
Japanese B-NORP
colonial O
rule O
, O
and O
he O
earned O
a O
doctorate O
in O
agriculture O
at O
Tokyo B-GPE
. O

Back O
in O
the B-DATE
1960s I-DATE
, O
when O
Taiwanese B-NORP
history O
was O
still O
a O
taboo O
subject O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
Tai B-PERSON
organized O
a O
research O
society O
in O
Japan B-GPE
devoted O
to O
the O
study O
of O
Taiwanese B-NORP
history O
and O
other O
related O
Asian B-NORP
topics O
. O

For O
this O
work O
, O
he O
was O
blacklisted O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

Later O
, O
Tai B-PERSON
repeatedly O
declined O
invitations O
from O
Chiang B-PERSON
Ching-kuo I-PERSON
to O
return O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
until O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng-hui I-PERSON
was O
president O
that O
he O
finally O
came O
home O
. O

But O
when O
he O
did O
, O
his O
different O
perspective O
about O
Taiwan B-GPE
history O
brought O
Tai B-PERSON
Kuo-hui I-PERSON
farther O
and O
farther O
from O
the O
mainstream O
of O
the O
ruling O
party O
. O

Although O
Tai B-PERSON
did O
n't O
flinch O
from O
condemning O
the O
authoritarianism O
of O
Chiang B-PERSON
Kai-shek I-PERSON
and O
his O
son O
Chiang B-PERSON
Ching-kuo I-PERSON
, O
he O
also O
had O
harsh O
things O
to O
say O
about O
Japanese B-NORP
colonial O
rule O
- O
unlike O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng-hui I-PERSON
, O
who O
had O
fond O
memories O
of O
the O
colonial O
era O
. O

Tai B-PERSON
, O
who O
described O
himself O
as O
an O
" O
independent-minded O
Chinese B-NORP
born O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
" O
never O
lost O
his O
affection O
for O
China B-GPE
proper O
, O
and O
these O
sentiments O
set O
him O
apart O
from O
most O
historians O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

With O
regard O
to O
cross-strait O
relations O
, O
Tai B-PERSON
made O
his O
famous O
" O
testicles O
analogy O
. O
" O

Taiwan B-PERSON
is O
a O
part O

he O
stated O

just O

Though O
inextricably O
linked O
to O
the O

the O
testicles O
have O
their O
own O
special O

He O
based O
his O
analogy O
on O
what O
he O
deemed O
was O
best O
for O
all O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
. O

His O
theory O
was O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
Lee B-PERSON
Teng-hui I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
belief O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
should O
establish O
clear O
boundaries O
between O
itself O
and O
the O

. O

But O
Tai B-PERSON
Kuo-hui I-PERSON
never O
shied O
from O
controversy O

Otherwise O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
chosen O
to O
study O
Taiwanese B-NORP
history O
to O
begin O

Throughout O
his O
life O

he O
maintained O
his O
tough O

academic O
independence O

holding O
fast O
to O
his O
opinions O
and O
never O

He O
was O
greatly O
admired O
for O
his O
intellectual O

These O
great O

' O
deaths O
have O
come O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O

The B-ORG

a O
university O
president O
has O
been O
found O
guilty O

The O

that O

need O
no O

fear O
torture O

Right O

But O
here O
where O
we O
are O
, O
ah O
, O
what O
you O
have O
seen O
is O
the O
attention O

You O
see O
, O
um O
, O
that O
hot O

topic O
personalities O
are O
thrown O
up O
one O

the O
other O
, O
and O
everybody O
pays O
attention O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
. O

Maybe O
I O
'm O
speaking O
rubbish O
, O
ah O
, O
but O
I O
wonder O
if O
there O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
slave O

nature O
, O
ah O
, O
in O
our O

this O

bones O
, O
or O
something O
else O
. O

No O
. O

No O
, O
they O
are O
being O
led O
along O
. O

Why O
do O
I O
feel O
this O
is O
wrong O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
um O
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
the O
past O
, O
our O
subjects O
of O
conversation O
, O
um O
, O
we O
discussed O
politics O
; O
we O
discussed O
economy O
; O
we O
discussed O
culture O
; O
we O
discussed O
art O

or O
we O
talked O
about O
other O
things O
, O
ah O
. O

But O
now O
what O
I O
often O
talk O
with O
him O
about O
, O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
we O
have O
been O
completely O
led O
around O
by O
the O
nose O
by O
topics O
manufactured O
on O
the O
Internet O
. O

You O
say O
that O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
were O
led O
around O
by O
the O
emperor O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
thousand I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

It O
might O
be O
that O
later O
on O
, O
um O
, O
that O
it O
will O
be O
the O
political O
parties O
that O
lead O
them O
around O
by O
the O
nose O
. O

And O
what O
about O
now O
. O

It O
is O
people O
leading O
them O
around O
by O
their O
noses O
. O

The O
people O
themselves O
are O
leading O
the O
people O
around O
-- O

In O
the O
name O
of O
the O
people O
. O

Whoever O
it O
is O
, O
it O
is O
always O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
people O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
the O
web O
represents O
the O
people O
. O

Why O
has O
such O
a O
situation O
, O
ah O
, O
as O
you O
describe O
emerged O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

That O
is O
, O
why O
is O
the O
entire O
public O
space O
so O
monotone O
. O

Currently O
, O
%pw O
, O
I O
feel O
that O
it O
is O
mainly O
that O
there O
still O
is O
n't O
a O

the O

What O
did O
President O

to O

President O
Vicente B-PERSON
Fox I-PERSON
touched O
on O
the O
biggest O
, O
most O
troubling O
issues O
facing O
Mexicans B-NORP
today B-DATE
. O

He O
spoke O
about O
what O
he O
can O
do O
to O
solve O
the O
poverty O
that O
has O
driven O
so B-CARDINAL
many I-CARDINAL
hundreds I-CARDINAL

thousands I-CARDINAL
of O

north O

He O
wants O

try O
to O
find O
a O
way O
to O
keep O
them O
home O
, O
and O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
other O
things O
that O
he O
touched O
on O
, O
Lisa B-PERSON
, O
he O
says O
that O
Mexico B-GPE
never O
again O
will O
return O
to O
repressive O
means O
to O
try O
to O
control O
the O
people O
. O

My O

will O
not O
tolerate O
that O
these O
methods O

We O
will O
not O
use O
the O
security O

of O
our O

to O
silence O
critics O
or O
neutralize O
opponents O
. O

Repression O
will O
never O
again O
be O
a O
way O
to O
resolve O
political O
disputes O
. O

And O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
other O
main O
subjects O
he O
touched O
on O
today B-DATE
, O
Lisa B-PERSON
, O
was O
the O
conflicted O
southern O
state O
of O
Chiapas B-GPE
. O

Fox B-PERSON
says O
that O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
presidential O
act O
will O
be O
to O
send O
up O
a O
proposal O
to O
the O
congress O
to O
immediately O
begin O
to O
bring O
a O
process O
of O
peace O
back O
into O
Chiapas B-GPE
State I-GPE
and O
that O
's O
something O
that O
people O
really O
did O
n't O
expect O
to O
happen O
so O
quickly O
here O
. O

All O
of O
these O
issues O
actually O
are O
issues O
that O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
has O
been O
watching O
very O
carefully O
, O
and O
US B-GPE
Secretary O
of O

Madeleine B-PERSON
Albright I-PERSON
is O
there O
in O
mexico B-GPE

for O

She O

new O
Foreign B-ORG
Minister O

who O
is O
the O
writer O

academic O
Jorge B-PERSON
Castaneda I-PERSON

He O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
lived O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
for O
a O
number O
of O
years O
. O

What O
has O
the O
new O
President O
Fox B-PERSON
said O
so O
far O
about O
relations O
with O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
? O

Fox B-PERSON
says O
that O
Mexico B-GPE
's O
relations O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
are O
strong O
, O
but O
he O
sees O
opportunities O
. O

He O
still O
is O
convinced O
that O
he O
can O
talk O
to O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
government O
into O
opening O
up O
its O
borders O
and O
eventually O
letting O
in O
more O
Mexican B-GPE
's O
under O
the O
Free O
Trade O
Agreement O
. O

More O
Mexicans B-NORP
, O
who O
would O
come O
in O
to O
the O
country O
legally O
. O

Fox B-PERSON
believes O
that O
it O
in O
20 B-DATE
or I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
Canada B-GPE
and O
all O
of O
Latin B-LOC
America I-LOC
should O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
unified O
market O
, O
much O
in O
a O
way O
that O
the B-ORG
European I-ORG
Community I-ORG
is O
unified O
, O
and O
so O
Fox B-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
use O
his O
marketing O
sensibility O
to O
try O
to O
convince O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
that O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O

Remember O
, O
Fox B-PERSON
comes O
from O
a O
strong O
marketing O
background O
. O

He O
was O
the O
executive O
of O
Coca B-ORG
- I-ORG
Cola I-ORG
from O
Mexico B-GPE
, O
so O
he O
understands O
how O
these O
things O
work O
. O

I O
wonder O
if O
you O
can O
tell O
us O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
something O
that O
Cuban B-NORP
President O
Fidel B-PERSON
Castro I-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
also O
there O
today O
, O
said O
earlier O
in O
the B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

He O
said O
that O
the O
previous O
President O
Ernesto B-PERSON
Zedillo I-PERSON
was O
too O
much O
of O
a O
servant O
to O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

Is O
that O
issue O
something O
that O
Fox B-PERSON
is O
likely O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
? O

Is O
that O
kind O
of O
a O
warning O
for O
Fox B-PERSON
at O
all O
? O

That O
's O
definitely O
a O
message O
to O
Vicente B-PERSON
Fox I-PERSON
from O
Fidel B-PERSON
Castro I-PERSON
and O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
other O
Latin B-NORP
American I-NORP
presidents O
feel O
the O
same O
way O
, O
but O
Fox B-PERSON
really O
has O
already O
shown O
very O
early O
on O
that O
he O
is O
going O
to O
try O
to O
be O
an O
unusual O
kind O
of O
leader O
with O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
he O
is O
not O
going O
to O
kowtow O
to O
Washington B-GPE
. O

In O
fact O
, O
just O
weeks B-DATE
after O
he O
was O
elected O
he O
showed O
Washington B-GPE
that O
he O
has O
his O
own O
initiatives O
and O
some O
of O
them O
might O
even O
frighten O
leaders O
in O
our O
national O
capital O
there O
, O
so O
I O
think O
you O
can O
expect O
Fox B-PERSON
to O
continue O
the O
economic O
policies O
that O
Mexico B-GPE
has O
been O
criticized O
for O
, O
that O
is O
following O
the O
economic O
lead O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
will O
come O
up O
with O
concrete O
policies O
for O
dealing O
with O
immigrants O
' O
rights O
and O
other O
such O
matters O
that O
we O
have O
never O
really O
seen O
before O

Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
reported O
that O
he O
had O
previously O
mentioned O
that O
the O
market O
was O
facing O
danger O
some B-DATE
five I-DATE
months I-DATE
prior O
to O
its O
collapse O
last B-DATE
February I-DATE
, O
pointing O
out O
that O
when O
the O
stock O
market O
surpassed O
the O
20 B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
points O
, O
that O
was O
exaggerated O
and O
illogical O
because O
the O
Price O
Earnings O
Ratio O
in O
some O
companies O
were O
reaching O
a B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
and O
that O
was O
not O
possible O
. O

That O
collapse O
was O
expected O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O
speculation O
that O
occurred O
. O

With O
the O
revival O
of O
the O
petro-market O
and O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
's O
revenue O
, O
both O
of O
the O
government O
or O
the O
citizens O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
and O
limited O
investment O
opportunities O
, O

so O
inflation O
occurred O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
collapse O
and O
not O
a O
single O
Saudi B-NORP
family O
escaped O
being O
hit O
. O

Even O
in O
the O
current O
market O
situation O
, O
if O
we O
compare O
to O
the O
Price O
Earning O
Ratio O
then O
it O
is O
still O
logical O
and O
realistic O
, O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
current O
share O
prices O
were O
logical O
and O
reasonable O
. O
and O
demanded O
investors O
stop O
speculating O
because O
that O
leads O
to O
many O
bankruptcies O
. O

He O
said O
that O
there O
are O
companies O
on O
the O
market O
in O
which O
profit O
potential O
was O
nonexistent O
. O

He O
applauded O
the O
decision O
of O
the B-ORG
Capital I-ORG
Market I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
to O
suspend O
dealings O
of O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
companies O
and O
said O
that O
it O
was O
a O
wise O
decision O
but O
it O
had O
come O
too O
late O
as O
there O
were O
fears O
from O
speculators O
of O
suspending O
the O
shares O
of O
other O
companies O
, O
and O
this O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
state O
's O
rights O
, O
to O
suspend O
dealing O
in O
the O
shares O
of O
companies O
that O
were O
hopeless O
. O

He O
indicated O
that O
there O
might O
be O
other O
companies O
whose O
shares O
will O
be O
suspended O
and O
that O
investors O
should O
buy O
into O
companies O
that O
, O
it O
was O
hoped O
, O
would O
remain O
and O
continue O
. O

Speaking O
of O
the O
timing O
of O
this O
announcement O
and O
the O
reasons O
for O
it O
, O
Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
said O
that O
the O
undertaking O
to O
pump O
10 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
into O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
was O
made O
last B-DATE
March I-DATE
and O
that O
the O
investment O
he O
had O
undertaken O
was O
not O
completed O
till O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
being O
announced O
. O

He O
hoped O
that O
the O
market O
had O
hit O
the O
bottom O
but O
without O
any O
mad O
rises O
as O
had O
happened O
in O
the O
past O
, O
as O
they O
were O
short O
- O
term O
paper O
profits O
. O

He O
expected O
that O
the O
current O
year O
would O
witness O
the O
restoration O
of O
equilibrium O
to O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
after O
reaching O
a O
kind O
of O
sensibility O
. O

He O
explained O
that O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
authorities O
were O
insistent O
on O
driving O
out O
the O
speculators O
who O
were O
pushing O
the O
market O
into O
harming O
them O
and O
the O
small O
investors O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
market O
is O
looking O
for O
a O
bottom O
to O
hit O
thereafter O
to O
be O
able O
to O
rise O
in O
a O
logical O
and O
reasonable O
way O

He O
indicated O
that O
the O
market O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
bottom O
at O
7000 B-CARDINAL
points O
or O
slightly O
less O
. O

He O
added O
: O
" O
We O
do O
not O
want O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
stock O
market O
to O
return O
to O
insane O
and O
unacceptable O
figures O
as O
it O
did O
in O
the O
past O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
is O
investing O
in O
the O
market O
to O
restore O
confidence O
in O
it O
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
the O
investor O
must O
be O
educated O
to O
invest O
in O
companies O
that O
have O
a O
good O
future O
. O
" O

Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
confirmed O
that O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
is O
continuing O
with O
its O
plans O
to O
list O
for O
sale O
a O
percentage O
of O
its O
shares O
agreed O
upon O
with O
the O
state O
, O
to O
reach O
a O
figure O
that O
serves O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
citizen O
and O
does O
not O
harm O
the O
future O
interests O
of O
the O
Company B-ORG
and O
its O
expansions O
. O

He O
stressed O
that O
even O
in O
the O
current O
market O
conditions O
the O
company O
would O
be O
listing O
its O
shares O
on O
the O
market O
in O
the B-DATE
current I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Speaking O
of O
the O
downturn O
on O
the O
stock O
market O
in O
light O
of O
the O
increasing O
petroleum O
revenues O
and O
the O
record O
budget O
achieved O
by O
the O
state O
during O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
financial I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
said O
that O
the O
stock O
market O
is O
a O
mirror O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
. O
but O
if O
the O
stock O
market O
was O
exaggerated O
then O
there O
would O
be O
a O
difference O
between O
the O
state O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
in O
general O
and O
the O
stock O
market O
and O
this O
is O
what O
happened O
. O

He O
offered O
a O
number O
of O
suggestions O
to O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
and O
officials O
to O
help O
the O
companies O
, O
namely O
: O
to O
allow O
companies O
to O
buy O
their O
shares O
immediately O
which O
would O
give O
trust O
in O
the O
market O
and O
would O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
dealt O
in O
shares O
on O
the O
market O
and O
thus O
increase O
the O
amount O
of O
profit O
; O
to O
allow O
non-Saudi B-NORP
companies O
and O
corporations O
to O
enter O
the O
market O
by O
placing O
controls O
such O
as O
instituting O
sectors O
for O
shares O
and O
an O
ownership O
percentage O
ceiling O
; O
and O
to O
oblige O
companies O
to O
disclose O
future O
expectations O
of O
the O
companies O
' O
performances O
. O

A O
discussion O
with O
the O
CEOs O
of O
Saudi B-NORP
companies O
has O
been O
initiated O
by O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
by O
sending O
them O
letters O
dealing O
with O
the O
disclosure O
of O
the O
companies O
' O
future O
expectations O
. O

This O
is O
done O
by O
all O
companies O
in O
the O
developed O
world O
with O
the O
aim O
of O
obliging O
the O
company O
to O
achieve O
the O
declared O
profit O
or O
something O
close O
to O
it O
and O
to O
re-assure O
the O
investor O
. O

Finally O
, O
more O
disclosures O
between O
the O
company O
and O
the O
investor O
, O
since O
there O
are O
companies O
with O
specific O
profit O
achieving O
strategies O
not O
from O
its O
basic O
accredited O
activities O
, O
such O
as O
achieving O
non-repeatable O
profit O
. O

He O
added O
: O
" O
We O
wish O
to O
remove O
the O
weak O
companies O
that O
do O
not O
represent O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
from O
the O
market O
and O
separate O
them O
from O
the O
companies O
with O
big O
profits O
. O
" O

He O
confirmed O
that O
these O
proposals O
would O
be O
made O
to O
state O
officials O
to O
be O
applied O
to O
companies O
. O

Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
denied O
that O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
had O
liquidized O
any O
portfolio O
it O
had O
in O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
, O

but O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
had O
increased O
its O
investments O
in O
a O
number O
of O
companies O
, O
and O
in O
addition O
did O
not O
enter O
into O
any O
speculation O
at O
all O
but O
is O
working O
on O
buying O
and O
keeping O
for O
investment O
. O

He O
also O
denied O
that O
the O
collapse O
of O
last B-DATE
February I-DATE
was O
planned O
by O
any O
party O
, O
but O
it O
rather O
occurred O
because O
of O
the O
illogical O
prices O
reached O
by O
the O
market O
. O

He O
indicated O
that O
the O
collapse O
was O
expected O
because O
of O
the O
inflation O
in O
share O
prices O
and O
said O
that O
any O
person O
familiar O
with O
the O
stock O
market O
will O
confirm O
that O
the O
collapse O
was O
imminent O
at O
that O
time O
. O

He O
explained O
that O
the O
state O
could O
not O
in O
any O
way O
be O
made O
responsible O
for O
the O
losses O
of O
investors O
on O
the O
market O
and O
must O
remain O
neutral O
on O
that O
. O

The O
role O
of O
the O
state O
is O
to O
prevent O
the O
manipulators O
from O
exposing O
the O
market O
to O
fluctuations O
, O
to O
punish O
them O
and O
to O
suspend O
bankrupt O
companies O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
there O
is O
a O
study O
on O
dividing O
the O
market O
because O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
place O
profitable O
, O
strong O
companies O
alongside O
weak O
loss O
- O
making O
ones O
, O
and O
this O
is O
where O
the B-ORG
Capital I-ORG
Market I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
plays O
a O
role O
. O

He O
called O
upon O
the O
investors O
and O
not O
the O
experience O
lacking O
speculators O
in O
the O
market O
, O
to O
go O
to O
investment O
funds O
and O
banks O
to O
invest O
their O
finances O
in O
a O
professional O
manner O
, O
so O
as O
to O
avoid O
getting O
caught O
in O
market O
fluctuations O
and O
become O
exposed O
to O
losses O
. O

As O
for O
the O
stagnation O
in O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
, O
it O
is O
not O
probable O
, O
because O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
and O
at O
the O
peak O
of O
the O
stock O
market O
collapse O
, O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
flourished O
and O
achieved O
a O
6 B-PERCENT
per I-PERCENT
cent I-PERCENT
growth O
, O
because O
there O
is O
a O
difference O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
and O
that O
of O
the O
stock O
market O
. O

He O
asserted O
that O
expectations O
indicate O
there O
will O
be O
no O
stagnation O
in O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
economy O
during O
the B-DATE
current I-DATE
year I-DATE
due O
to O
its O
strength O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
serious O
strong O
steps O
taken O
by O
the O
government O
to O
not O
to O
concentrate O
on O
the O
petroleum O
factor O
. O

Regarding O
the O
company O
's O
competition O
for O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
license O
to O
operate O
cell O
phones O
in O
the O
Kingdom B-GPE
, O
he O
said O
that O
they O
have O
an O
alliance O
with O
the B-ORG
Turkish I-ORG
Turkcell I-ORG
Company I-ORG
to O
compete O
for O
this O
license O
, O
and O
as O

, O
the O
company O

not O

such O
competition O

Regarding O

Al B-PERSON

Waleed I-PERSON
declared O
the O
pumping O
of O
ten B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
and O
specified O
companies O
that O
were O
" O
respectable O
" O
according O
to O
his O
claim O
. O

He O
won O
the O
confidence O
of O
some O
and O
small O
speculators O
entered O
the O
market O
, O
whereupon O
an O
artificial O
surge O
occurred O
, O
then O
they O
were O
caught O
in O
the O
collapses O
which O
followed O
that O
made O
- O
up O
surge O
and O
which O
have O
continued O
until O
today B-DATE
. O

Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
had O
lost O
his O
credibility O
on O
the O
market O
. O

He O
had O
to O
change O
his O
rhetoric O
if O
he O
wanted O
to O
restore O
his O
credibility O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
his O
mission O
of O
beating O
the O
market O
-LRB- O
as O
some O
believe O
-RRB- O
. O

Thus O
he O
had O
to O
specify O
in O
his O
present O
statement O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
names O
of O
the O
companies O
, O
the O

Speaking O
of O
the O
timing O
of O
this O
announcement O
and O
the O
reasons O
for O
it O
, O
Prince O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
said O
that O
the O
undertaking O
to O
pump O
10 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
into O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
was O
made O
last B-DATE
March I-DATE
. O
and O
that O
the O
investment O
he O
had O
undertaken O
was O
not O
completed O
till O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
being O
announced O
. O

It O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
believe O
that O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
had O
been O
" O
only O
" O
collecting O
since B-DATE
last I-DATE
March I-DATE
-LRB- I-DATE
almost I-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
ago I-DATE
-RRB- I-DATE
until I-DATE
now I-DATE
. O
Because O
, O
if O
that O
had O
happened O
, O
then O
the O
rates O
of O
his O
prices O
would O
be O
much O
higher O
than O
the O
current O
prices O
. O

This O
would O
be O
unreasonable O
behavior O
from O
an O
opportunist O
like O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
. O

And O
so O
this O
explanation O
of O
his O
is O
untruthful O
. O

" O
He O
expected O
that O
the B-DATE
current I-DATE
year I-DATE
would O
witness O
the O
restoration O
of O
equilibrium O
to O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
market O
after O
reaching O
a O
kind O
of O
sensibility O
. O
" O

This O
expression O
seems O
to O
have O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
to O
it O
: O

the O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
to O
send O
a O
signal O
to O
the B-ORG
Market I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
that O
he O
does O
not O
want O
to O
create O
a O
very O
strong O
imaginary O
surge O

and O
this O
might O
mean O
that O
the B-ORG
Market I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
is O
being O
informed O
that O
he O
will O
be O
satisfied O
with O
less O
profit O
than O
his O
-LRB- O
counterpart O
-RRB- O
and O
then O
get O
out O
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
: O
to O
win O
the O
dealers O
' O
belief O
that O
the O
market O
might O
have O
hit O
the O
bottom O
and O
that O
they O
should O
safely O
enter O
with O
their O
cash O
and O
begin O
raising O
its O
index O
. O

" O
He O
explained O
that O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
authorities O
were O
insistent O
on O
driving O
out O
the O
speculators O
who O
were O
pushing O
the O
market O
into O
harming O
them O
and O
the O
small O
investors O
. O
" O

In O
this O
clause O
of O
the O
statement O
he O
is O
assuring O
the O
minds O
of O
dealers O
that O
does O
not O
intend O
to O
dispose O
of O
his O
shares O
to O
them O
through O
this O
action O
of O
his O
, O
and O
so O
they O
should O
enter O
and O
raise O
up O
the O
index O
of O
his O
companies O
. O

" O
the B-ORG
Kingdom I-ORG
Holding I-ORG
Company I-ORG
is O
investing O
in O
the O
market O
to O
restore O
confidence O
in O
it O
. O
" O

And O
" O
more O
importantly O
, O
the O
investor O
must O
be O
educated O
to O
invest O
in O
companies O
that O
have O
a O
good O
future O
. O
" O

Here O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Waleed I-PERSON
confirms O
sowing O
of O
trust O
in O
the O
hearts O
of O
speculators O
but O
only O
if O
they O
enter O
and O
give O
a O
boost O
to O
his O
companies O
. O

That O
's O
why O
he O
finished O
by O
saying O
" O
educating O
the O
investor O
" O

It O
is O
the O
pinnacle O
of O
education O
when O
the O
speculators O
enter O
into O
Al B-PERSON

Waleed I-PERSON

They O

When O

, O
he O
could O
scarcely O

that O
today B-DATE
would O
really O

the B-DATE

when O
he O
would O
be O
taken O

the O

he O
so O

He O
was O
hopeful O

and O
his O
eyes O
were O
bright O

He O
talked O

some O

this O

see O
him O
since O
the O
explosion O
that O
killed O
his O
mother O
, O
father O
, O
brothers O

They O
were O
horrified O
by O
his O
injuries O
and O
pleaded O
for O
him O
to O
get O
specialist O
treatment O
outside O
Iraq B-GPE

His O
doctor O
, O
too O
, O
is O

too O
, O

It O

The O
part O

dreads O

In O

and O
far O
too O
traumatic O

Putting O

brave O

finally O
going O

-- O


Great O
. O

What O
should O
we O
talk O
about O
? O

Well O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Tell O
me O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
America B-GPE
. O

I O
have O
n't O
seen O
the O
news O
in O
ages O
. O

Really O
? O

You O
did O
d- O

In O
the O
American B-NORP
news O
I O
mean O

I O
know O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
Russia B-GPE

but O

yeah O
. O

Well O
let O
's O
see O
. O

What O
's O
going O
on O
? O
%uh O

You O
want O
me O
to O
just O
give O
you O
some O
headlines O
? O

yeah O
. O

Give O
me O
some O
headlines O
. O

What O
's O
Clinton B-PERSON
up O
to O
? O

up- O

yeah O
. O

I O
was O
just O
going O
to O
say O
Clinton B-PERSON
just O
came O
out O
yesterday O
with O
his O
%uh O
his O
statement O
concerning O
affirmative O
action O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
, O
and O
basically O
he O
has O
in O
the O
past O
said O
that O
he O
was O
not O
in O
favor O
of O
%uh O
you O
know O
of O
making O
%um O
al- O
allowances O
strictly O
based O
on O
race O

but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
%uh O
the O
analysis O
in O
the O
news O
shall O
we O
say O
the O
conservative O
analysis O
in O
the O
news O
is O
that O
Clinton O
just O
came O
out O
and O
said O
that O
he O
does O
n't O
believe O
in O
quota O
systems O
and O
in O
reverse O
discrimination O
but O
that O
he O
does O
believe O
that O
affirmative O
action O
is O
necessary O
to O
move O
%uh O
you O
know O
black O
Americans B-NORP
forward O
and O
to O
give O
them O
the O
opportunities O
that O
they O
've O
been O
denied O
. O

So O
he O
's O
trying O
to O
, O
k- O
kind O
of O
walking O
a O
tight O
rope O
. O

You O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
? O

Right O
. O

In O
other O
words O
l- O

He O
's O
trying O
to O
please O
everybody O
. O

yeah O
. O

Let O
's O
see O
if O
we O
can O
make O
everybody O
happy O

I O
think O
that O
he O
's O

Then O
he O
just O
ends O
up O
making O
nobody O
happy O
. O

I O
think O
you O
're O
right O
. O

Because O
you O
know O
affirmative O
action O
is O
really O
under O
attack O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
on O
, O
from O
many O
different O
quarters O
right O
now O
. O

And O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
big O
, O
it O
's O
a O
big O
issue O
because O
it O
's O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
gender O
, O
I O
mean O
not O
a O
gender O
a O
race O

%uh O
color O
blind O

we O
're O
supposed O
to O
be O
race O
color O
blind O

and O
yet O
it O
's O
like O
contractors O
that O
are O
bidding O
you O
know O
with O
a O
high O
bid O
or O
higher O
than O
-- O
the O
lowest O
bid O
are O
still O
getting O
the O
contracts O
only O
because O
they O
are O
of O
ethnic O
protected O
you O
know O
black O
or O
whatever O
. O

And O
it O
's O
really O
you O
know O

Right O
. O

And O
then O
, O
then O
so O
they O
're O
taking O
lawsuits O
to O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
and O
all O
of O
this O

so O
it O
's O

Wow O
. O

Another O
thing O
that O
just O
came O
up O
was O
that O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
said O
that O
the O
redistricting O
of O
the O
congressional O
districts O
one O
of O
which O
is O
in O
Georgia B-GPE
violated O
the O
Constitution B-WORK_OF_ART
because O
it O
was O
based O
primarily O
on O
race O
. O

There O
was O
you O
know O
a O
new O

What O
did O
they O
do O
i- O

They O
were O
doing O
it O
because O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
it O
more O
e- O
like O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
it O
less O
segregated O
? O

They O
were O
trying O
to O
make O
the O
district O
majority O
black O
Americans B-NORP

so O
therefore O
they O
drew O
it O
%uh O
all O
the O
way O
across O
the O
state O
. O

You O
see O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O
? O

oh O
right O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

a O
, O
a O
very O
narrow O
district O

and O
it O
created O
a O
majority O
black O
district O
which O
then O
elected O
a O
, O
a O
black O
representative O

and O
then O
it O
was O
challenged O
because O
it O
said O
well O
the O
only O
reason O
that O
it O
has O
been O
done O
this O
way O
is O
just O
to O
ensure O
that O
it O
was O
majority O
black O

and O
that O
's O
not O

right O

you O
know O

Hello O
? O

I O
'm O
here O
. O

okay O
. O

Anyway O

I O
'm O
mulling O
all O
this O
over O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
, O
it O

So O
it O
's O
interesting O
because O
today O
we O
had O
a O
discussion O
with O
students O
about O
%um O
because O
we O
're O
doing O
a O
pre-departure O
orientation O

so O
we O
were O
, O
we O
had O
our O
hot O
topics O
discussion O
today O
where O
we O
break O
in O
small O
groups O

and O
we O
talked O
about O
like O
political O
correctness O
and O
racial O
prejudice O
and O
sexual O
harrassment O
, O
feminism O
and O
just O
like O
different O
topics O
that O
they O
might O
encounter O
in O
America O
where O
the O
people O
have O
different O
attitudes O
than O
here O
in O
Russia B-GPE
. O

So O
that O
was O
one O
of O
the O
things O
kind O
of O
like O
that O

But O
I O
have O
I O
'm O
not O
really O
up O
on O
what O
the O
attitude O
is O
in O
America B-GPE
because O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
there O
in O
so O
long O
. O

Well O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
frustration O
I O
think O
over O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
're O
, O
there O
're O
a O
number O
of O
evidences O
that O
the O
affirmative O
action O
program O
is O
in O
fact O
discriminating O
in O
the O
other O
direction O

and O
people O
are O
saying O
wait O
a O
minute O
. O

Why O
do O
n't O
we O
just O
give O
everybody O
%uh O
%uh O
%uh O
an O
e- O
try O
to O
give O
everybody O
an O
equal O
shot O

and O
if O
someone O
feels O
that O
they O
've O
been O
discriminated O
against O
because O
of O
their O
race O
go O
at O
it O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
, O
of O
trying O
to O
remedy O
it O
through O
the O
courts O
rather O
than O
saying O
that O
government O
has O
to O
give O
X O
number O
of O
contracts O
to O
minority O
no O
matter O
what O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
as O
a O
result O
some O
%uh O
m- O
some O
people O
are O
getting O
contracts O
just O
because O
of O
the O
color O
of O
their O
skin O

and O
you O
know O
what O
I O
'm O
saying O

it O
's O
, O
it O
's O
, O
it O
's O
still O

When O
they O
might O
not O
even O
be O
the O
most O
qualified O
. O

e- O
either O
them O
they O
're O
, O
they O
're O
not O
even O
, O
they O
're O
not O
the O
low O
bid O

you O
know O
normally O
on O
contracts O
you O
take O
the O
low O
bid O
that O
meets O
the O
quality O
spec- O
specification O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
but O
now O
you O
've O
, O
there O
have O
been O
several O
cases O
where O
clearly O
you O
know O
it O
was O
, O
they O
did O
n't O
get O
it O
because O
they O
just O
did O
n't O
were O
n't O
the O
right O
color O
skin O
. O

So O
now O
is O
that O
Right O
. O
is O
that O
really O
remedying O
the O
situation O

or O
is O
it O
's O
creating O
a O
lot O
of O
%uh O
of O
%uh O
resentment O
? O

And O
%uh O
Right O
. O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
too O
bad O
. O

How O
long O

God O
what O
a O
mess O
. O

oh O
it O
's O
a O
mess O
. O

It O
really O
is O
. O

W- O
how O
long O
have O
you O
been O
there O
by O
the O
way O
? O

Over O
here O
? O

%um O
it O
'll O
be O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
November B-DATE
. O

Wow O
. O

So O
you O
really O
are O
out O
of O
touch O
are O
n't O
you O
? O

Well O
I O
like O
to O
think O
I O
'm O
not O
totally O
out O
of O
touch O

Well O
y- O
I O
know O
what O
it O
's O
like O
. O

I O
was O
never O
very O
in O
touch O
even O
when O
I O
was O
still O
America B-GPE

so O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

You O
're O
that O
type O
. O

I O
got O
you O
. O

I O
was O
always O
in O
my O
, O
in O
my O
own O
world O
anyway O

so O
. O

Well O
I O
know O
what O
it O
's O
like O
because O
I O
've O
went O
, O
having O
lived O
over O
in O
Korea B-GPE
for O
almost B-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
%um O
it O
's O
you O
know O
when O
you O
come O
back O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
the O
you O
know O
the O
society O
has O
changed O
a O
little O
bit O

the O
question O

. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
think O

might O

but O
I O
do O

it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
my O
particular O
area O
of O
expertise O
you O
know O
i- O

Right O
. O

that O
that O
's O
going O
to O
be O
regular O
program O

but O
still O
I O
would O
like O
to O
know O
so O
I O
can O
tell O
people O
like O
you O
. O

So O
were O
you O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
job O

or O
did O
they O
just O
like O
come O
to O
you O
? O

Well O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
new O
job O

and O
I O
've O
been O
looking O
for O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O

%uh O
. O

and O
%uh O
when O
I O
went O
to O
NASA B-ORG
in O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
you O
know O
the O
one O
that O
you O
missed O

I O
know O
the O
one O
, O
the O
great O
one O
that O
was O
so O
much O
fun O
. O

oh O
it O
was O
a O
blast O

but O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
it O
was O
more O
fun O
than O
Miami B-GPE
I O
mean O
you O
know O
. O

But O
it O
it O
was O
fun O
though O
. O

You O
would O
have O
enjoyed O
it O

and O
as O
I O
said O
to O
you O
in O
the O
email O
the O
%uh O
the O
Russians B-NORP
and O
the O
Siberians B-NORP
and O
all O
of O
these O
people O
were O
just O
hilarious O
. O

I O
mean O
we O
had O
a O
, O
we O
had O
a O
nice O
little O
visit O
. O

We O
really O
did O
. O

%uh O
it O
's O
too O
bad O
I O
did O
n't O

oh O
I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
they O
were O
calling O
her O
Lovie O
. O

We O
were O
in O
stitches O
to O
hear O
that O
she O
was O
calling O
herself O
Lovie O
. O

oh O
really O
? O

You O
did O
n't O
know O
that O
? O

Well O
because O
you O
would O
n't O
say O
that O
. O

Because O
in O
Russian B-NORP
it O
's O
just O
you O
know O
Lyubov B-PERSON

but O
it O
's O
just O
a O
Russian B-NORP
name O
. O

I O
mean O
you O
would O
n't O
think O
of O
translating O
it O
into O
English B-LANGUAGE

but O
the O
thought O
of O
people O
calling O
her O
Lovie O
in O
America B-GPE
is O
so O
funny O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
the O
, O
that O
's O
what O
she O
said O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
any O

Well O
then O
I O
mean O
it O
's O
so O
her O
like O
it O
's O
just O
so O
her O
to O
do O
that O
that O
I O
just O
I O
just O
think O
it O
's O
hysterical O
. O

Is O
it O
? O

yeah O
. O

You O
should O
have O
seen O
them O
dancing O
around O
with O
the O
crowd O
out O
there O
when O
they O
had O
this O
%uh O
%uh O
Carribean B-NORP
band O
or O
something O
%uh O
running O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
New B-GPE
Orleans I-GPE
. O

It O
was O
kind O
of O
interesting O
. O

uh-huh O

But O
%um O

yeah O

And O
we O
went O
, O
we O
went O

%um O
you O
know O
you O
got O
to O
sort O
of O
do O
that O
kind O
of O
weird O
stuff O
. O

%um O

So O
that O
's O
kind O
of O
how O
it O
got O
to O
where O
it O
was O
%uh O
you O
know O

that O

Shandong B-GPE

began O
to O

the O
policy O
of O
employee O
housing O
monetization O

within O
the O
bounds O
of O
the O
entire O

, O
meaning O
that O

employees O
can O
no O
longer O
get O

from O
the O

unit O
they O
work O
for O

Henceforth O
, O
using O

using O

Shandong B-GPE
is O
currently O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
province O
to O
implement O
the O
policy O
of O
housing O
monetization O

in O
China B-GPE
. O

Moreover O
, O
provinces O

such O

are O

and O

granted O
full O

to O
this O

At O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
China B-GPE
, O
at O
a O
series O
of O
meetings O
, O
pointed O
out O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
key O
tasks O
of O
the O
1998 B-DATE
reform O
is O
to O
accelerate O
housing O
system O
reform O
, O
to O
accelerate O
the O
process O
of O
transforming O
housing O
from O
a O
material O
allocation O
to O
a O
monetary O
allocation O
, O
and O
to O
establish O
a O
new O
method O
to O
monetize O
benefit O
allocations O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
decades I-DATE
, O
although O
housing O
was O
always O
a O
top O
matter O
of O
expense O
for O
China B-GPE
's O
countryside O
residents O
, O
but O
in O
the O
cities O
and O
towns O
, O
however O
, O
housing O
was O
treated O
as O
an O
employee O
benefit O
, O
freely O
allocated O
by O
work O
units O
, O
and O
only O
needing O
extremely O
low O
rent O
to O
be O
submitted O
every O
month O
. O

In O
1994 B-DATE
, O
after O
the B-ORG
" I-ORG
State I-ORG
Council I-ORG
's I-ORG
decision O
to O
deepen O
city O
and O
township O
housing O
system O
reform O
" O
was O
announced O
, O
city O
and O
township O
employee O
housing O
started O
to O
take O
steps O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
threefold B-CARDINAL
common O
responsibility O
, O
namely O
the O
State B-ORG
, O
the O
collective O
and O
the O
individual O
. O

An O
obvious O
sign O
of O
this O
is O
the O
housing O
accumulation O
fund O
system O
starting O
to O
be O
commonly O
established O
. O

According O
to O
what O
was O
revealed O
at O
the O
working O
forum O
on O
housing O
reform O
work O
in O
some O
provinces O
and O
cities O
held O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
recently O
, O
currently O
the O
total O
amount O
of O
national O
accumulation O
funds O
surpassed O
80 B-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
. O

This O
huge O
accumulation O
fund O
is O
playing O
an O
increasingly O
obvious O
role O
in O
supporting O
individuals O
to O
purchase O
housing O
and O
housing O
construction O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
there O
has O
been O
a O
big O
increase O
in O
the O
nation O
's O
monthly O
rent O
of O
public O
housing O
in O
cities O
and O
townships O
, O
with O
some O
regions O
increasing O
to O
account O
for O
about B-PERCENT
10 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
income O
of O
dual O
income O
families O
. O

Although O
the O
pace O
of O
housing O
reform O
is O
being O
accelerated O
, O
the O
old O
method O
of O
allocating O
housing O
through O
benefits O
has O
still O
has O
not O
been O
broken O
through O
. O

According O
to O
a O
recent O
survey O
conducted O

which O

This O

exactly O
why O

wins O
the O

from O

has O
been O

by O

In O
the O

the O

we O
emphasized O
were O
: O
conforming O
to O
classical O
requirements O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
art O
of O
calligraphy O
; O
healthy O

certain O

solid O

and O

establishing O
a O

artistic O
concept O
-- O
these O
are O
the O
characteristics O
of O
our O
Chinese B-NORP
art O
of O

, O
and O
because O
we O
have O
these O
characteristics O
, O
we O
won O
the O
attention O
of O
foreign O

. O

Therefore O
, O
any O
work O
that O
can O
follow O
tradition O
but O
not O
stagnate O
, O
and O
have O
new O
artistic O
concepts O
will O
be O
appraised O
well O

In O
a O
serious O

the O

decided O
this O
round O

outstanding O
entries O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
kind O
of O
situation O
embarrassed O
the O
judges O
, O
namely O
, O
that O
some O
works O
displayed O
really O
beautifully O
written O
characters O
, O
conformed O
to O
a O
certain O
calligraphy O
style O
, O
and O
showed O
signs O
of O
new O
achievement O
in O
art O
form O
, O
but O
regretfully O
, O
because O
the O
calligraphers O
have O
poor O
basic O
knowledge O
, O
they O
wrote O
some O
wrong O
characters O
, O
and O
since O
there O
was O
no O
remedy O
, O
finally O
lost O
in O
the O
selection O
. O

Everyone O
both O
felt O
pity O
for O
them O
, O
and O
felt O
that O
this O
is O
an O
issue O
very O
worth O
worrying O
about O
. O

Some O
young O
calligraphy O
lovers O
, O
just O
at O
the O
time O
when O
they O
should O
have O
been O
studying O
hard O
, O
were O
hindered O
. O

So O
basic O
knowledge O
was O
not O
enough O
, O
structure O
was O
not O
systematic O
, O
and O
the O
level O
was O
rather O
low O
. O

They O
have O
some O
ability O
in O
calligraphy O
, O
but O
eventually O
can O
not O
produce O
a O
final O
masterpiece O
at O
a O
higher O
level O
, O
and O
can O
not O
create O
works O
which O
may O
be O
used O
as O
teaching O
models O
. O

We O
sincerely O
hope O
that O
these O
friends O
will O
amend O
this O
aspect O
quickly O
, O
and O
hope O
future O
works O
will O
show O
both O
superior O
capability O
in O
calligraphy O
, O
and O
convey O
healthy O
and O
deep O
thoughts O
, O
and O
even O
reveal O
a O
clear O
, O
meaningful O
and O
elegant O
mind O
. O

This O
is O
the O
eager O
expectation O
that O
many O
older O

calligraphers O
have O
placed O
on O
us O
younger O

nearly O
40 B-PERCENT

contain O

. O

The O
random O
quality O
inspection O
of O
this O
time O
mainly O
involved O
the O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
batches O
of O
plastic O
wrap O
for O
food O
packaging O
and O
cutting O
boards O
manufactured O
by O
twelve B-CARDINAL
companies O
in O
Zhejiang B-GPE
Province O
. O

The O

rate O

the O
random O

is O
61.5 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

A O
total O
of O
five B-CARDINAL
batches O
of O
the O
products O
failed O
to O
pass O
, O
of O
which O
three B-CARDINAL
batches O
are O
plastic O
cutting O
boards O
. O

The O
main O
existing O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
residue O
after O
evaporation O
exceeds O
the O
limit O
. O

According O
to O
the O
information O
, O
the O
residue O
after O
evaporation O
refers O
to O
the O
chemical O
substances O
possibly O
produced O
by O
plastic O
products O
when O
coming O
into O
contact O
with O
water O
, O
vinegar O
, O
oil O
, O
and O
other O
liquids O
during O
use O
. O

These O
chemical O
substances O
are O
often O
harmful O
to O
the O
human O
body O
. O

Some O
individual O
production O
enterprises O
add O
excessive O
amounts O
of O
talc O
, O
calcium O
carbonate O
, O
and O
other O
substances O
into O
their O
products O
in O
order O
to O
increase O
the O
hardness O
of O
the O
plastic O
cutting O
boards O
. O

This O
is O
the O
main O
reason O
resulting O
in O
the O
failure O
of O
these O
products O
to O
pass O
. O

Experts O
suggest O
that O
when O
shopping O
for O
a O
plastic O
cutting O
board O
, O
choose O
the O
plastic O
cutting O
board O
that O
is O
evenly O
colored O
and O
has O
no O
impurities O
or O
pungent O
smell O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
during O
use O
, O
it O
is O
best O
not O
to O
use O
it O
to O
cut O
very O
hot O
food O
because O
high O
temperature O
will O
accelerate O
the O
decomposition O
of O
harmful O
chemical O
substances O
so O
that O
they O
will O
enter O
the O
food O
and O
affect O
people O

health O

For O
many O
overseas O

And O
passing O

one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O

. O

Recently O
, O

, O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Citizenship I-ORG
and I-ORG
Immigration I-ORG
Services I-ORG
has O
changed O
the O
format O
of O

. O

This O
decision O
has O
increased O
the O
difficulties O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
becoming O
U.S. B-GPE
citizens O
, O
and O
has O
resulted O
in O
quite O
some O
repercussions O
among O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
community O
. O

Let O
us O
look O
at O
a O
report O
from O
the O
American B-NORP
Chinese B-LANGUAGE
- O
language O
television O
. O

After O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Citizenship I-ORG
and I-ORG
Immigration I-ORG
Services I-ORG
announced O
the O
questions O
for O
the O
new O
citizenship O
exam O
, O
there O
were O
mixed O
reactions O
within O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
communities O
, O
in O
particular O
from O
some O
of O
the O
elderly O
who O
wished O
to O
become O
citizens O
. O

Some O
felt O
that O
it O
would O
be O
more O
difficult O
to O
become O
naturalized O
citizens O
from O
now O
on O
. O

Some O
citizenship O
classes O
are O
also O
forced O
to O
update O
their O
existing O
curricula O
. O

It O
is O
generally O
believed O
that O
the O
revised O
naturalization O
questions O
will O
increase O
the O
difficulty O
of O
the O
exam O
. O

Currently O
, O
most O
of O
the O
questions O
only O
require O
simple O
answers O
to O
be O
satisfactory O
. O

However O
, O
from O
the O
known O
portions O
of O
the O
new O
exam O
questions O
, O
future O
exams O
will O
assess O
naturalization O
applicants O
' O
knowledge O
in O
areas O
like O
American B-NORP
social O
and O
political O
history O
; O
and O
applicants O
need O
to O
extend O
and O
elaborate O
their O
answers O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
current O
applicants O
only O
need O
to O
know O
that O
the O
structure O
of O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
government I-ORG
is O
a O
separation O
of O
powers O
among O
the O
legislative O
, O
executive O
, O
and O
judicial O
branches O
, O
but O
future O
applicants O
will O
need O
to O
answer O
why O
there O
is O
a O
need O
for O
such O
a O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

So O
for O
those O
who O
do O
not O
have O
a O
good O
command O
of O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O
they O
will O
usually O
find O
it O
more O
difficult O
. O

（一） O

For O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
, O
today B-DATE
is O
a O
special O
day O
. O

This B-DATE
day I-DATE
came O
with O
great O
difficulty O
for O
China B-GPE
. O

Before O
the O
war O
, O
the O
gap O
between O
China B-GPE
and O
Japan B-GPE
was O
far O
greater O
than O
mere O
numbers O
. O

Before O
the O
war O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
steel O
production O
was O
less O
than O
200,000 B-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
-LRB- O
steel O
production O
in O
China B-GPE
was O
centered O
mainly O
in O
the O
northeast O
, O
and O
it O
was O
controlled O
by O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
-RRB- O
. O

Japan B-GPE
's O
was O
about O
9 B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
. O

The O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
Japan B-GPE
had O
a O
complete O
industrial O
system O
and O
was O
able O
to O
independently O
produce O
all O
its O
weapons O
, O
from O
handguns O
to O
aircraft O
carriers O
, O
and O
it O
had O
a O
formidable O
research O
production O
capacity O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
every O
year O
they O
were O
able O
to O
produce O
1,580 B-CARDINAL
airplanes O
, O
744 B-CARDINAL
large O
- O
bore O
cannon O
, O
330 B-CARDINAL
tanks O
, O
, O
more O
than O
9,500 B-CARDINAL
vehicles O
, O
with O
a O
shipbuilding O
capacity O
of O
more O
than O
400,000 B-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
and O
a O
naval O
construction O
capacity O
of O
50,000 B-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
. O

Compared O
to O
this O
, O
at O
the O
time O
China B-GPE
could O
only O
produce O
rifles O
and O
small O
cannon O
; O
its O
capacity O
to O
produce O
heavy O
weapons O
was O
zero B-CARDINAL
. O

The O
only O
munitions O
plant O
capable O
of O
producing O
heavy O
weapons O
in O
the O
northeast O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
. O

This O
means O
that O
China B-GPE
's O
consumption O
could O
not O
be O
met O
. O

Before O
the O
war O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
air O
force O
had O
some O
300 B-CARDINAL
airplanes O
; O
that O
may O
seem O
like O
quite O
a O
few O
, O
but O
they O
were O
all O
used O
up O
in O
just O
one B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
and O
afterward O
we O
could O
only O
watch O
as O
Japanese B-NORP
aircrafts O
ruled O
the O
skies O
over O
China B-GPE
. O

On O
the O
surface O
, O
China B-GPE
is O
a O
large O
country O
, O
and O
Japan B-GPE
was O
the O
little O
guy O
taking O
on O
the O
giant O
. O

The O
most O
obvious O
part O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
being O
a O
big O
country O
was O
its O
population O
advantage O
. O

In O
fact O
Japan B-GPE
's O
total O
population O
after O
it O
had O
taken O
over O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
the O
Northeast O
, O
and O
Korea B-GPE
was O
not O
so O
very O
much O
smaller O
than O
China B-GPE
's O
, O
with O
about O
200 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
, O
at O
best O
a O
2:1 B-CARDINAL
ratio O
. O

The O
important O
thing O
is O
that O
Japan B-GPE
had O
a O
complete O
reserve O
system O
, O
with O
more O
than O
four B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
reserves O
who O
had O
received O
basic O
military O
training O
. O

China B-GPE
had O
basically O
no O
reserve O
military O
personnel O
, O
and O
the O
" O
national O
army O
" O
relied O
primarily O
on O
seizing O
able O
- O
bodied O
men O
to O
fill O
its O
ranks O
. O

These O
so O
- O
called O
able O
- O
bodied O
men O
were O
sorely O
lacking O
in O
training O
; O
all O
they O
could O
do O
was O
learn O
to O
fight O
in O
battle O
. O

Therefore O
, O
in O
the O
field O
, O
it O
often O
happened O
that O
a O
Japanese B-NORP
battalion O
-LRB- O
battalion O
system O
-RRB- O
was O
able O
to O
defeat O
a O
whole O
division O
of O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
army O
; O
it O
was O
not O
just O
the O
difference O
in O
equipment O
: O
even O
more O
important O
were O
the O
differences O
in O
logistical O
supplies O
and O
training O
. O

-RAB- O
The O
training O
gap O
in O
particular O
can O
be O
said O
to O
have O
been O
the O
difference O
between O
earth O
and O
sky O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
the O
standards O
of O
Western O
armies O
, O
except O
for O
a O
few O
divisions O
, O
at O
the O
time O
for O
most O
of O
the O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
Chinese B-NORP
military O
units O
of O
every O
description O
it O
would O
be O
more O
appropriate O
to O
speak O
of O
militia O
, O
or O
mobs O
of O
bandits O
. O

What O
was O
even O
more O
disheartening O
was O
China B-GPE

disintegration O
: O

After O
ten B-DATE

of O
bloody O

the O

China B-GPE

vital O
organs O
were O
diseased O

and O
it O
was O
like O

But O
the O
miracle O
happened O
, O
and O
what O
is O
more O
, O
this O
miracle O
was O
created O
by O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
! O

In O
the O
face O
of O
an O
unprecedented O
national O
enemy O
, O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
race O
demonstrated O
rare O
courage O
and O
fortitude O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
their O
military O
strength O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
army O
taking O
on O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
army O
was O
like O
an O
egg O

But O
the O

advanced O
again O

and O

" O
; O
in O

it O
was O
all O
rather O
inconceivable O
. O

For O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
from B-DATE
1937 I-DATE
to I-DATE
1941 I-DATE
, O
China B-GPE
fought O
against O
Japan B-GPE
on O
its O

, O
and O
it O
even O
counterattacked O

China B-GPE
organized O
a O
winter B-DATE
offensive O
on O
the O
front O
in O
1939 B-DATE
. O

In O
1940 B-DATE
there O
were O
a O
hundred B-CARDINAL
battles O
in O
the O
enemy O

rear O
area O
, O
which O
let O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
army O
know O
that O
their O
enemy O
was O
still O
alive O
and O
kicking O
. O

In O
order O
to O
resolve O
the O
" O
China B-GPE
incident O
, O
" O
Japan B-GPE
sent O
in O
even O
young O
boys O
to O
fight O
; O
at O
the O
height O
of O
it O
, O
there O
was O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
division O
left O
in O
Japan B-GPE
. O

Of O
course O
if O
Japan B-GPE
had O
fully O
mobilized O
, O
it O
could O
have O
called O
up O
several B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
more O
troops O
, O
as O
in O
the O
later O
time O
when O
they O
knew O
they O
were O
about O
to O
be O
annihilated O
. O

But O
mobilizing O
troops O
at O
home O
and O
sending O
them O
off O
to O
another O
country O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
different O
things O
; O
it O
was O
just O
that O
their O
logistics O
could O
n't O
support O
it O
. O

Troops O
leaving O
the O
country O
to O

need O
to O
be O
lean O

It O
was O
n't O
that O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
did O
n't O
want O
to O
settle O
the O
" O
China B-GPE
incident O
, O
" O
it O
was O
that O
they O
could O

What O

this O
miracle O
in O

was O
the O
awakening O
of O
the O

of O

In O

the O

burned O
with O
an O

they O
demonstrated O
a O
fierce O
determination O

In O
their O
memoirs O

mention O
that O
when O

were O
wounded O
in O

no O

paid O
any O

This O

The O

U.S. B-GPE

Mr. O

at O

that O
three B-CARDINAL

lost O
their O

a O

But O
one B-CARDINAL
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
official O
knowledgeable O
about O
the O

plan O
cautioned O
against O

that O
there O
will O
be O
bold O
new O

economy O

`` O

Aside O
from O
the O
Soviet B-NORP
economic O

talks O
on O
cutting O
strategic O

, O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
issue O
the O
Soviets B-NORP
are O
likely O
to O
want O
to O
raise O

naval O

Western O
analysts O
say O
that O
, O
given O
the O
meeting O
's O
setting O
at O
sea O
, O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
is O
unlikely O
to O
pass O
up O
the O
opportunity O
to O
press O
once O
again O
for O
negotiated O
cuts O
in O

of O
both O
the B-ORG
North I-ORG
Atlantic I-ORG
Treaty I-ORG

That O
theme O
has O
been O
a O
recurring O
one O
for O
Soviet B-NORP
military O
officials O
for O
much O
of O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

They O
argue O
that O
as O
the O
Kremlin B-ORG
follows O
through O
on O
announced O
plans O
to O
cut O
land O
forces O
-- O
the O
Soviets B-NORP
' O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
reasons O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
aides O
are O
anxious O
to O
insist O
that O
the O
coming O
meeting O
will O
be O
informal O

comparisons O

the O

such O
loosely O
structured O
superpower O
gathering O
, O
former O
President O
Reagan B-PERSON
's O
1986 B-DATE
meeting O
with O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
in O
Reykjavik B-GPE
, O
Iceland B-GPE
. O

That O
meeting O
sent O
shivers O
through O
the O
Western O
alliance O
because O
Mr. O
Reagan B-PERSON
was O
pulled O
into O
discussing O
the O
possible O
elimination O
of O
nuclear O
weapons O
without O
consulting O
American B-NORP
allies O
. O

Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
said O
that O
he O
initiated O
talks O
with O
the O
Soviets B-NORP
on O
the O
informal O
meeting O
by O
sending O
a O
proposal O
to O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
last B-DATE
July I-DATE
, O
which O
the O
Soviet B-NORP
leader O
readily O
accepted O
. O

But O
word O
of O
the O
possible O
session O
was O
closely O
held O
by O
the O
president O
and O
a O
handful O
of O
top O
aides O
, O
and O
word O
of O
it O
did O

reach O
many O
second B-ORDINAL

level O
officials O
until O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

Indeed O
, O
many O
senior O
officials O
had O
been O
insisting O
for O
weeks B-DATE
that O
Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
was O
n't O
interested O
in O
such O
an O
informal O

Though O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
political O
critics O
at O
home O
have O
been O
urging O
him O
to O
open O
a O
more O
direct O
dialogue O
with O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
, O
it O
actually O
was O
the O
arguments O
of O
leaders O
within O
the O
Soviet B-NORP
bloc O
itself O
that O
led O
the O
president O
to O
seek O
the O
December B-DATE
meeting O
. O

Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
decided O
he O
wanted O
the O
meeting O
after O
talking O
in O
Europe B-LOC
in O
July B-DATE
with O
the O
leaders O
of O
Poland B-GPE

who O
urged O
him O

support O
Mr. O

a O

While O

Hsueh B-PERSON
then O
used O

The O
decision O
to O
close O
down O
the O
group O
is O
basically O
up O
to O
you O
. O

Maybe O
this O
decision O
will O
encourage O
some O
to O
create O
their O
own O
groups O
or O
participate O
more O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
. O

In O
all O
cases O
, O
the O
correspondence O
gave O
everyone O
including O
me O
the O
opportunity O

communicate O

learn O
about O
other O
different O
views O
. O

In O
this O
respect O

I O
am O
grateful O

this O

I O
would O
like O
to O
know O
the O
primary O
goal O
that O
you O
perceived O
when O
you O
decided O
to O
proceed O
with O
this O
initiative O

Maybe O
then O
I O
can O
understand O
your O
decision O
to O
close O
it O
, O
if O
that O
is O
what O
you O
want O
, O
of O
course O
. O

My O
view O
on O
this O
matter O
is O
that O
it O
has O
- O
the O
group O
- O
accomplished O
some O
sort O
of O
achievement O
. O

The O
obvious O
negativity O
from O
some O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
you O
will O
not O
face O
negativity O
in O
life O
, O
in O
the O
community O
. O

This O
is O
important O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
fear O
that O
some O
might O
have O
- O
from O
the O
security O
aspect O
- O
who O
are O
burdened O
with O
ideas O
rejecting O
the O
other O
, O
and O
maybe O
the O
desire O
to O
eliminate O
him O
and O
ca O
n't O
frankly O
and O
openly O
express O
their O
ideas O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
they O
desire O
. O

This O
is O
understandable O
. O

I O
previously O
informed O
those O
who O
want O
to O
participate O
in O
a O
blog O
I O
started O

but O
got O
no O

Later O
I O
learned O
that O
the O

I O
hope O
this O
is O
the O
reason O
and O
not O
the O
intellectual O
guardianship O
or O
the O
spiral O

Despite O
my O
feeling O
for O
several O

wish O

A O

The O

hoping O

The O

reported O
angrily O
on O
the O

which O
these O

Le B-ORG
Parisien I-ORG
did O
its O
best O
to O
explain O
that O
its O
complaints O
were O
not O
driven O
by O
racism O
but O
that O
traditionelles O
were O
as O
Parisian B-NORP
as O
steak O

, O
cheap O
red O

and O
Gauloises O

and O
, O
when O
they O

the O

lost O
a O
vital O

its O
underground O

The O

who O
had O
worked O
rue B-FAC

for O
nearly B-DATE

complained O
in O

that O
, O
not O
only O
was O
she O
being O
driven O
to O
penury O

but O
that O
the O
city O
was O
losing O
part O

its O

She O
clearly O
hit O
a O
nerve O
; O
the O

it O
was O
argued O
by O
those O

could O
be O
anywhere O
in O
Europe B-LOC

from O
Barcelona B-GPE

At O

, O
it O
was O
further O
argued O
as O
the O
old O
generation O
of O
whores O
began O
to O
leave O
the O
city O
in O
droves O
, O
was O
the O
very O
soul O
of O
Paris B-GPE
itself O
. O

It O
is O
easy O
to O
see O
this O
as O
a O
typically O
Gallic B-NORP
overstatement O
. O

It O
is O
a O
fact O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
history O
of O
prostitution O
in O
Paris B-GPE
is O
, O
for O
many O
, O
inextricably O
linked O
to O
the O
political O
fortunes O
of O
the O
city O
. O

This O
tradition O
can O
be O
traced O
to O
18th B-DATE
- I-DATE
century I-DATE
Enlightenment O
ideology O
and O
the O
rise O
of O
a O
new O
class O
of O
thinkers O
, O
the O
libertins O
, O
who O
were O
avowedly O
atheist O
and O
sceptical O
about O
all O
other O
entrenched O
beliefs O
such O
as O
the O
power O
of O

. O

During O
this O
period O
, O
the O
city O
swarmed O
with O
whores O
and O
to O
call O
for O
their O
suppression O
was O
to O
be O
in O
favour O
of O
Church O
and O
King O
and O
other O
superstitions O
. O

The O
growth O
of O
widespread O
prostitution O
in O
Paris B-GPE
was O
paralleled O
by O
the O
rise O
of O
the O
new O
literary O
genre O
of O
pornography O
. O

Much O
early O
pornography O
was O
entirely O
functional O
, O
providing O
a O

The O
genre O
soon O
became O
an O
entertainment O
in O
its O
own O
right O
and O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
police O
energy O
was O
wasted O
on O
pursuing O
printers O
, O
publishers O
and O
readers O
of O
work O
that O
was O
deemed O
to O
be O
anti-Christian B-NORP
and O
anti-social O
but O
which O
most O
Parisians B-NORP
found O
as O

This O
is O
also O
an O
argument O
made O
by O
the O

Ovidie B-PERSON

who O
came O
to O
national O
prominence O
in O
France B-GPE
in O
2002 B-DATE
with O
her O
book O
Porno B-WORK_OF_ART
Manifesto I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
a O
polemic O
in O
defence O
of O
porn O
. O

Ovidie B-PERSON
's O
big O
idea O
then O
was O
that O
everyday O
Parisian B-NORP
life O
had O
been O
invaded O
by O
`` O
porno O
chic O
'' O
- O
the O
use O
of O
pornographic O
imagery O
in O
advertising O
- O
and O
that O
this O
was O
a O
betrayal O
of O
the O
intentions O
of O
those O
who O
, O
like O
her O
, O
both O
used O
prostitutes O
and O
made O
`` O
real O
porn O
'' O
. O

I O
was O
then O
writing O
a O
book O
about O
Paris B-GPE
which O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
set O
out O
to O
cover O
the O
underground O
sexuality O
of O
the O
city O

and O
, O
inspired O
by O
her O
call O
for O
a O
return O
to O
older O
Parisian B-NORP
traditions O
of O
sexual O
experience O
, O
I O
went O
to O
speak O
to O
Ovidie B-PERSON
for O
the O
first O
time O
on O
a O
chilly O
September B-DATE
morning O
in O
a O
cafe O
near O
rue B-FAC
Saint I-FAC

Denis I-FAC
. O

In O
those O
days O
, O
Ovidie B-PERSON
was O
tiny O
, O
pierced O
and O
dressed O
in O
black O
pyjamas O
like O
a O
junior O
Maoist B-NORP
. O
She O
began O
by O
quoting O
the O
contemporary O
thinkers O
Jean B-PERSON
Baudrillard I-PERSON
, O
Georges B-PERSON
Bataille I-PERSON
and O
Guy O
Debord B-PERSON
, O
who O
, O
all O
in O
different O
ways O
, O
made O
the O
case O
for O
sexual O
freedom O
, O
and O
cited O
the O
popularity O
of O
porn O
in O
pre-Revolutionary O
Paris B-GPE
, O
before O
explaining O
her O
notion O
that O
, O
because O
it O
is O
based O
on O
a O
universal O
need O
, O
in O
the O
right O
hands O
, O
`` O
porn O
can O
set O
you O
free O
'' O
. O

Ovidie B-GPE
went O
on O
: O

pornography O
, O
she O
said O
, O
was O
about O
nothing O
more O
than O
the O
promise O
of O
human O
happiness O
. O

The O
physical O
and O
economic O
exploitation O
that O
are O
undeniably O
involved O
in O
the O
sex O
industry O
, O
she O
said O
, O
are O
wrong O
only O
because O
they O
are O
a O
betrayal O
of O
this O
original O
, O
quite O
innocent O
trust O
. O

The O
exploitation O
of O
women O
in O
particular O
, O
she O
said O
, O
was O
a O
betrayal O
of O
the O
original O
liberating O
aims O
of O
18th B-DATE

century I-DATE
pornography O
. O

It O
was O
this O
egalitarian O
philosophy O
that O
Ovidie B-PERSON
claimed O
to O
recapture O
in O
her O
work O
. O

This O
did O
not O
preclude O
payment O
: O
indeed O
quite O
the O
opposite O
. O

`` O
I O
have O
sex O
for O
money O

Ovidie B-PERSON
said O
, O

'' O

, O
of O

that O
demands O
respect O

I O
met O
Ovidie B-PERSON
again O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
in O
Neuilly B-LOC
, O
the O
posh O
part O
of O
Paris B-GPE
where O
she O
now O
lives O
- O
presumably O
having O
made O
a O
packet O
from O
her O
films O
with O
titles O
like O
Orgie B-WORK_OF_ART
en I-WORK_OF_ART
Noir I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
Lilith B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

It O
was O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
since O
we O
had O
last O
met O
and O
she O
was O
now O
a O
mother O
. O

She O
was O
also O
a O
little O
heftier O
around O
the O
edges O
but O
still O
with O
a O
definitive O
view O
on O
her O
own O
activities O
and O
the O
present O
state O
of O
sex O
in O
the O
city O
. O

`` O
The O
problem O
is O
with O
Paris B-GPE
itself O
, O
and O
probably O
France B-GPE
itself O
, O
'' O
she O
told O
me O
. O

`` O
They O
are O
both O
changing O
for O
the O
worse O
. O

Parisians B-NORP
are O
unhappy O

and O
that O
is O
expressed O
in O
their O
sexuality O
. O

A O
place O
like O
rue B-FAC
Saint I-FAC
- I-FAC
Denis I-FAC
represents O
everything O
that O
has O
gone O
wrong O
- O

it O
is O
not O
a O
place O
to O
go O
and O
have O
sex O
happily O
, O
as O
a O
person O
or O
as O
a O
couple O
. O

It O
is O
now O
just O
gangsters O
and O
girls O
who O
are O
sex O
slaves O
from O
Eastern B-LOC
Europe I-LOC

Africa B-LOC

The O
myths O
of O
the O
orgies O
to O
be O
found O
there O
, O
that O
you O
read O
in O
Georges B-PERSON
Bataille I-PERSON
, O
may O
not O
have O
been O
entirely O
true O

but O
they O
did O
correspond O
to O
some O
form O
of O
reality O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
practically O
impossible O
to O
have O
good O
sex O
with O
strangers O
in O
Paris B-PERSON
. O
'' O

We O
talked O
of O
the O
vogue O
for O
echangisme O
-LRB- O
'' O
swinging O
'' O
-RRB- O
which O
was O
in O
vogue O
in O
Paris B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
late I-DATE
1990s I-DATE
and O
- O
as O
famously O
documented O
in O
the O
memoirs O
of O
Catherine B-PERSON
Millet I-PERSON
and O
the O
novels O
of O
Michel B-PERSON
Houellebecq I-PERSON
- O
is O
far O
from O
being O
the O
naff O
and O
suburban O
activity O
that O
it O
is O
in O
Great B-GPE
Britain I-GPE
, O
was O
briefly O
the O
height O
of O
Parisian B-NORP
chic O
. O

`` O
I O
know O
of O
some O
echangistes O
clubs O
that O
are O
still O
charming O
and O
passionate O
, O
'' O
Ovidie B-PERSON
says O
, O

`` O
but O
really O
all O
that O
too O
has O
gone O
. O

Catherine B-PERSON
Millet I-PERSON
is O
intelligent O
but O
her O
work O
is O
boring O
. O

And O
Michel B-PERSON
Houellebecq I-PERSON
is O
not O
Georges B-PERSON
Bataille I-PERSON
- O

he O
is O
really O
a O
moralist O
and O
his O
work O
does O
not O
celebrate O
sex O
like O
Bataille B-PERSON
but O
condemns O
it O
. O

So O
why O
read O
Houellebecq B-PERSON
or O
Millet B-PERSON
? O

I O
think O
the O
problem O
is O
political O
. O

French B-NORP
people O
despair O
of O
the O
future O
- O
which O
is O
unstable O
and O
dark O
- O
and O
they O
are O
too O
morose O
to O
have O
sex O
properly O
. O
'' O

The O
conversation O
moves O
on O
to O
a O
discussion O
of O
rising O
violence O
in O
the O
suburbs O
, O
a O
disintegrating O
economy O
and O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
political O
solution O
. O

But O
notwithstanding O
the O
prevailing O
gloomy O
moods O
in O
the O
city O
, O
individual O
Parisians B-NORP
still O
take O
a O
chauvinistic O
pride O
in O
their O
horror O
of O
prudery O

They O
still O
lament O
on O
the O

Le B-ORG

not O
only O
how O
the O

how O
, O
over O

have O
been O
policed O
by O

for O

it O
was O
also O
governed O

The O
first O

this O

following O
measures O

The O
first B-ORDINAL

Tell O
me O
your O
opinion O
on O
the O
Baker B-ORG

Hamilton I-ORG

recommendations O
? O

First O
of O
all O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
, O
and O
as O
it O
is O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
the O
report O
is O
written O
for O
the O
US B-NORP
administration O
and O
not O
for O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
. O

It O
also O
seems O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
that O
it O
represents O
recommendations O
and O
reviews O
rather O
than O
decisions O
. O

The O
decision O
remains O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
US B-NORP
administration O
. O

And O
I O
know O
that O
much O
of O
its O
content O
does O
not O
represent O
the O
will O
and O
direction O
followed O
by O
the O
Administration B-ORG
. O

I O
can O
also O
say O
that O
it O
set O
off O
from O
shaky O
ground O
, O
because O
the O
review O
was O
not O
complete O
in O
covering O
the O
entire O
background O
and O
its O
outcome O
after O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
regime O
. O

And O
it O
should O
have O
reviewed O
events O
more O
accurately O
, O
and O
made O
them O
into O
a O
fertile O
ground O
for O
a O
solution O
. O

However O
, O
the O
report O
brought O
together O
contradictions O
in O
the O
vision O
and O
recommendations O
. O

The O
vision O
that O
we O
find O
at O
the O
beginning O
may O
differ O
from O
the O
vision O
towards O
the O
end O
and O
the O
initial O
recommendations O
differ O
from O
the O
recommendations O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
perhaps O
due O
to O
it O
being O
written O
by O
multiple O
authors O
or O
for O
having O
a O
muddled O
vision O
. O

But O
they O
expressed O
it O
and O
said O
there O
are O
no O
magic O
solutions O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
reality O
that O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
the O
region O
are O
going O
through O
may O
impose O
itself O
through O
the O
difficulties O
encountered O
by O
those O
who O
think O
they O
are O
providing O
the O
solution O
. O

But O
if O
I O
were O
asked O
to O
briefly O
, O
uh O
, O
evaluate O
the O
report O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
it O
is O
not O
lacking O
in O
good O
indications O
related O
to O
%pw O
the O
political O
course O
and O
the O
unity O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
devoid O
either O
of O
offences O
or O
negative O
trends O
regarding O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
course O
and O
the O

of O

To O
us O
, O
all O
of O
these O
are O
subject O
to O

%pw O
to O
examine O
the O
positive O

announced O
a O
90 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
devaluation O
of O
the O
ruble O
against O
the O
dollar O
for O
private O
transactions O
, O
in O
an O
apparent O
attempt O
to O
curb O
the O
nation O
's O
rapidly O
growing O
black O
market O
for O
hard O
currency O
. O

The O
measure O
, O
which O
will O
take O
effect O
next B-DATE
Wednesday I-DATE
, O
will O
create O
a O
two B-CARDINAL
- O
tier O
exchange O
rate O
. O

Commercial O
transactions O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
based O
on O
the O
official O
rate O
of O
about B-MONEY
0.63 I-MONEY
rubles I-MONEY
to O
the O
dollar O
. O

But O
for O
Soviet B-NORP
citizens O
who O
travel O
abroad O
for O
business O
or O
tourism O
, O
the O
rate O
will O
jump O
to O
6.26 B-MONEY

. O

Tass B-ORG

agency O
said O
the O
devaluation O
also O
will O
apply O
to O
foreigners O

transactions O
. O

But O
it O
did O
n't O
elaborate O
, O
and O
it O
remains O
unclear O
how O
far O
Western O
tourists O
and O
foreigners O
living O
in O
Moscow B-GPE
will O
be O
allowed O
to O
benefit O
from O
the O
sweeping O
rate O
cut O
. O

The O
current O
ruble O
rate O
has O
long O
been O
out O
of O
line O
with O
the O
black O
market O
. O

As O
Soviet B-NORP
leader O
Mikhail B-PERSON
Gorbachev I-PERSON
has O
opened O
up O
the O
country O
to O
foreign O
trade O
, O
the O
discrepancy O
has O
become O
ever O
greater O

. O

Even O
at O
such O
rates O
, O
black O
marketeers O
have O
been O
able O
to O
make O
big O
profits O
because O
of O
the O
dire O
shortage O
of O
consumer O
goods O
here O
. O

They O
use O
dollars O
to O
buy O
Western O
items O
such O
as O

then O

can O
fetch O
20 B-MONEY

more O

With O
more B-MONEY

300 I-MONEY

in O
savings O
accounts O
and O
little O
to O
spend O
them O
on O
, O
Soviet B-NORP
consumers O
grumble O
at O
the O
exorbitant O
black O
- O
market O
prices O
for O
such O
goods O
-- O
but O
they O
buy O
them O
anyway O
. O

Moscow B-GPE
has O
already O
tacitly O
admitted O
that O
the O
ruble O
is O
n't O
worth O
much O
, O
announcing O
in O
August B-DATE
that O
it O
will O
pay O
Soviet B-NORP
farmers O

the O

The O

also O
has O
been O
unwilling O

, O
using O
a O

would O
enable O
the B-ORG

would O
mop O
up O
some O

at O

But O
the O

most O
Soviet B-NORP
hotels O

for O

demand O

from O
Western O
visitors O

Unless O

rules O
are O
changed O
, O
the O
devaluation O
could O
cause O
difficulties O

only O

that O

These O

on O
the O

Senior O

I O
think O
it O

asking O

it O

The O
FDA B-ORG

it O

the O
FDA B-ORG
keeps O

Which O
worries O
some O

if O
creating O

The O

Mr. O
Gonzalez B-PERSON
also O
has O
split O
with O
the O
left O
in O
reaffirming O
Spain B-GPE
's O
NATO B-ORG
commitment O
and O
in O
renewing O
a O
defense O
treaty O
with O
the O
U.S. B-GPE

Mr. O
Gonzalez B-PERSON
is O
not O
quite O
a O
closet O
supply O
- O
side O
revolutionary O
, O
however O
. O

He O
did O
not O
go O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
have O
in O
tax O
reductions O
; O
indeed O
he O
combined O
them O
with O
increases O
in O
indirect O
taxes O
. O

Yet O
the O
best O
the O
far O
- O
left O
could O
do O
was O
not O
enough O
to O
deter O
the O
biggest O
voting O
bloc O
-- O
nearly B-PERCENT
40 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
-- O
from O
endorsing O
the O
direction O
Spain B-GPE
is O
taking O
. O

Now O
he O
can O
go O
further O
. O

He O
should O
do O
more O
to O
reduce O
tax O
rates O
on O
wealth O
and O
income O
, O
in O
recognition O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
those O
cuts O
yield O
higher O
, O
not O
lower O
, O
revenues O
. O

He O
could O
do O
more O
to O
cut O
public O
subsidies O
and O
transfers O
, O
thus O
making O
funds O
available O
for O
public O
services O
starved O

six B-DATE

The O
voters O
delivered O
Mr. O
Gonzalez B-PERSON
a O
third B-ORDINAL
mandate O

his O
successes O

They O
, O
as O
well O
as O
numerous O
Latin B-NORP

East B-NORP

countries O
that O

are O

It O
would O
be O
