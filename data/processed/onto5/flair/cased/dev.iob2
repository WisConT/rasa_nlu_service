I O
can O
not O
assume O
the O
personality O
a O
Lebanese B-NORP
, O
especially O
one O
from O
Hezbollah B-NORP
, O
but O
I O
will O
describe O
some O
of O
the O
daily O
features O
of O
the O
demonstrations O
. O

The O
crowd O
mixture O
of O
demonstrations O
is O
made O
up O
of O
Shiite B-NORP
Lebanese I-NORP
and O
some B-NORP
Christian I-NORP
followers I-NORP
of I-NORP
Aoun I-NORP
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
do O
not O
forget O
our O
Syrian B-NORP
brothers O
. O

A O
demonstrator O
is O
paid O
the O
sum O
of O
twenty B-MONEY
American I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
daily O
, O
equivalent O
to O
75 B-MONEY
riyals I-MONEY
per O
day O
. O

If O
we O
multiply O
that O
by O
30 B-DATE
days I-DATE
, O
it O
would O
be O
equivalent O
to O
the O
salary O
of O
a O
Saudi B-NORP
employee O
in O
a O
phone O
kiosk O
, O
maybe O
more O
. O

You O
do O
the O
math O
. O

It O
is O
notable O
that O
the O
demonstrations O
came O
just O
in O
time O
to O
ruin O
the O
holiday O
season O
in O
Lebanon B-LOC
, O
especially O
in O
the O
area O
of O
central O
Beirut B-LOC
, O
known O
by O
the O
Saudis B-NORP
as O
Solidaire B-LOC
. O

Investments O
in O
Solidaire B-LOC
are O
by O
Christians B-NORP
and O
Sunni B-NORP
Muslims I-NORP
. O

There O
are O
no O
Shiite B-NORP
investments O
, O
neither O
in O
tourism O
nor O
in O
Solidaire B-LOC
. O

Their O
investments O
are O
only O
in O
the O
mountain O
restaurants O
on O
the O
South O
. O

Our O
Gulf O
brothers O
are O
afraid O
to O
eat O
in O
Shiite B-NORP
restaurants O
. O

tourist I-DATE

lots O
in O
Solidaire B-LOC
turned O
into O
camps O
. O

The O
time O
of O
demonstrations O
came O
in O
winter B-DATE
, O
so O
the O
demonstrators O
needed O
heat O
. O

They O
could O
only O
find O
wood O
in O
the O
public O
parks O
, O
which O
were O
totally O
ruined O
. O

Lebanese B-NORP
people O
gather O
in O
the O
evening O
around O
water O
- O
pipes O
, O
and O
a O
majority O
of O
them O
smoke O
hashish O
. O

Syrians B-NORP
line O
up O
with O
carts O
selling O
bread O
and O
eggs O
. O

Look O
at O
the O
female O
demonstrators O
from O
Hezbollah B-NORP
. O

They O
look O
like O
they O
are O
from O
an O
actress O
' O
agency O
. O

Imagine O
how O
the O
mercenary O
hashish O
- O
smoking O

might O
bring O
down O
the O
government O

I O
will O

a O

tells O
how O
he O
had O
followed O
three B-CARDINAL
Arab B-NORP
Sunni B-NORP
men O
for O
a O
period O
of O
some B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
and O
detained O
them O

informed O
an O

army O
road O

close O
to O
the O
area O
that O
he O
was O
pursuing O
" O

" O
, O
then O
attacked O
the O
car O
of O
the O
group O
in O
question O
. O

He O
also O
told O
the B-ORG
British I-ORG
Guardian I-ORG
that O
he O
took O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
men O
to O
Sadr B-GPE
City I-GPE
where O
his O
group O
had O
interrogated O
them O
then O
executed O
them O
, O
indicating O
that O
the O
members O
of O
the B-ORG
Mahdi I-ORG
Army I-ORG
usually O
demanded O
a O
ransom O
from O
the O
families O
of O
the O
hostages O
in O
return O
for O
freeing O
their O
relatives O
, O
and O
would O
liquidate O
them O
anyway O
after O
they O
receive O
the O
ransom O
. O

The O
newspaper O
quoted O
another O
commander O
in O
the B-ORG
Mahdi I-ORG
Army I-ORG
as O
saying O
; O
" O
We O
have O
taken O
10 B-CARDINAL

, O
we O
will O
get O
a O
ransom O

we O
get O
50 B-MONEY

" O
and O
he O
considered O
it O
to O
be O
the O
best O
business O
a O
person O
could O
be O
running O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
now O
! O

The O
newspaper O
described O
" O
Fadil B-PERSON
" O
as O
a O
valuable O
commander O
to O
this O
squad O
because O
he O
is O
a O
Shiite B-NORP
who O
grew O
up O
in O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
area O
south O
of O
Baghdad B-GPE
. O

He O
speaks O
in O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
dialect O
and O
carries O
an O
identity O
card O
from O
the O
Yusufiyah B-GPE
Sunni B-NORP
village O
. O

He O
was O
quoted O
as O
saying O
: O
" O
I O
can O
enter O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
areas O
without O
anyone O
knowing O
that O
I O
am O
a O
Shiite B-NORP
. O
" O

It O
pointed O
out O
that O
Fadil B-PERSON
and O
the O
likes O
are O
responsible O
for O
the O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
corpses O
which O
are O
being O
found O
daily O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
Baghdad B-GPE
security O
plan O
will O
not O
be O
successful O
unless O
the O
Americans B-NORP
control O
squads O
such O
as O
these O
to O
put O
breaks O
on O
the O
civil O
war O
. O

" O
Fadil B-PERSON
" O
was O

as O
saying O
that O
the B-ORG

resorting O
in O
its O
operations O
to O
reinforcements O
from O
Iraqi B-NORP
army O
units O

by O

or O
sympathizers O
, O
and O
confirmed O
that O
all O
the O

He O
added O
that O
the B-ORG

is O
receiving O

that O
they O

not O
encountering O
any O
problems O
in O
getting O

through O
to O

the O

Mr. O

During O

The O
most O

Soviet B-GPE

The O
success O
of O
the O
British B-NORP

was O
due O
to O
independent O

common O

rather O
than O
the O

It O
is O
no O

that O
from O
1844 B-DATE

1914 I-DATE
, O
when O
the B-ORG
Bank I-ORG

the O

with O

One B-CARDINAL
way O

an- O
%uh O
some B-DATE

I O
've O
got O
it O
sitting O
here O

so O
I O
ca O
n't O
ignore O

but O
I O
really O

Sure O

You O
know O
that O

not O

've O
met O
her O
each O
time O
. O

He O
must O
be O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
salesman O
because O
both O
times O
I O
think O
he O
was O
in O
Texas B-GPE
which O
is O
n't O
far O
you O
know O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
mhm O
. O
when O
you O
're O
in O
that O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Sure O

right O

I O
know O
it O
's O
close O
. O

%um O
but O
always O
on O
business O

and O
I O
remember O
they O
told O
me O
that O
he O
's O
gone O
a O
lot O
so O
he O
's O
you O
know O
he O
's O
in O
and O
out O
but O
that O
she O
manages O
very O
well O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O
mhm O

They O
all O
felt O
she O
was O
just O
a O
great O
mother O
you O
know O
the O
way O
she O
took O
care O
of O
her O
kids O
. O

Th- O
That O
's O
wonderful O

%uh O
you O
know O
%uh O
I O
think O
you O
learn O
a O
lot O
when O
you O
have O
such O
a O
big O
family O

you O
learn O
how O
to O
juggle O
i- O
juggle O
it O
around O
you O
know O
. O

really O
. O

Real- O
really O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
apparently O
she O

%uh O
%eh O
my O
impression O
is O
they O
're O
not O
wealthy O
you O
know O

in O
fact O
I O
got O
the O
impression O
they O
're O
they O
were O
struggling O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
%uh O
that O
's O
Elsa B-PERSON
and O
her O
husband O
when O
the O
babies O
were O
little O

Well O
you O
know O
the O
big O
family O
like O
that O
right O
. O

yeah O

and O
she O
could O
n't O
have O
been O
working O
very O
much O
at O
that O
point O
if O
at O
all O
. O

Either O

right O
right O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
so O
probably O
one O
%uh O
income O
just O
you O
know O
was O
making O
it O

%eh O
makes O
it O
hard O
of O
course O
. O

yeah O

you O
know O
. O

Now O
is O
n't O
there O
another O
daughter O

or O
do O
n't O

Is O
is O
it O
another O
daughter O
or O
another O
son O
? O

oh O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
either O

What O
's O
there O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
've O
only O
met O
those O
two B-CARDINAL

but O
you O
're O
right O

there O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
chil- O

I O
think O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
another O
child O
. O

%uh O
I O
'm O
positive O
you O
're O
right O

%eh O
it O
just O
registered O
. O

Right O
. O

It O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
they O
may O
even O
have O
said O
something O
about O
him O

but O
I O
never O
met O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
one O

so O
you O
know O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O
it O
did O
n't O
r- O
i- O
stick O
with O
me O
whatever O
they O
said O
. O

That O
was O
nice O
to O
see O
family O
you O
know O
%uh O
over O
the O
years O

it O
's O
very O
interesting O
. O

mhm O
. O

Is O
n't O
it O
? O

mhm O
. O

Do O
you O
ever O
see O
Abe B-PERSON
? O

He O
also O
lives O
in O
Ann B-GPE
Arbor I-GPE
. O

He O
's O
very O
sick O
. O

oh O
. O

He O
had O
major O
surgery O
four B-CARDINAL
or O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE

and O
he O
walked O
around O
That O
I O
remember O
. O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
like O
a O
walking O
skeleton O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
the O
only O
time O
I O
see O
him O
now O
is O
if O
I O
call O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
come O

mhm O
. O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
now O
that O
you O
mention O
it O

it O
's O
been O
about O
a O
year O
. O

mhm O
. O

Before O
you O
know O
when O
he O
was O
still O
quite O
well O
he O
would O
occasionally O
drop O
in O
mhm O
. O
because O
their O
daughter O
lives O
mhm O
. O
I O
think O
actually O
on O
the O
eastern O
part O
of O
the O
city O
. O

mhm O
. O

y- O

Not O
in O
Detroit B-GPE
but O
you O
know O

it O
's O
not O
Warren B-GPE

Sterling B-GPE
Heights I-GPE

I O
do O
n't O
know O

something O
like O
that O
. O

w- O
yeah O
. O

yeah O

yeah O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

oh O

So O
if O
he O
was O
going O
to O
visit O
her O
he O
would O
you O
know O
occasionally O
stop O
in O
here O
on O
his O
way O
home O
. O

Sure O
. O

Sure O
. O

But O
since O
he O
's O
been O
ill O
he O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I O
think O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
whether O
Linda B-PERSON
g- O
that O

their O
daughter O
is O
Linda B-PERSON

Yes O

yes O
. O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
she O
got O
married O
or O
she O
's O
just O
been O
living O
with O
this O
man O
for O
a O
long O
while O

but O
they O
tell O
me O
he O
works O
at O
Chrysler B-ORG

and O
he O
makes O
nice O
money O

and O
they O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
very O
nice O
home O
mhm O
. O
mhm O
. O
you O
know O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
good O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

You O
know O
considering O
everything O
I O
say O
that O
's O
good O
. O

mhm O
. O

a- O

So O
we O
took O
care O
of O
them O
. O

yeah O
. O

Now O
%uh O
we O
did O
n't O
take O
care O
of O
your O
children O
yet O
. O

Well O
%uh O
I O
h- O
still O
have O
two B-CARDINAL
in O
San B-GPE
Jose I-GPE
. O

And O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
so O
angry O
at O
you O

you O
send O
me O
a O
card O

uh-huh O
. O

you O
never O
send O
me O
an O
address O
or O
a O
telephone O
number O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
to O
respond O
. O

%ah O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
left O
stymied O

and O
I O
read O
it O
and O
read O
it O

and O
I O
say O
why O
did O
n't O
she O
give O
me O
a O
telephone O
number O

I O
'd O
call O
her O
back O
. O

yeah O

I O
never O
even O
think O
of O
it O
. O

You O
will O
next O
time O
. O

yeah O

now O
that O
you O
said O
it O
I O
sure O
will O
. O

Sure O
it O
's O
the O

ge- O
%uh O
get O
me O
a O
telephone O
number O
on O
that O
card O
so O
I O
can O
call O
you O
back O

All O
right O
. O

You O
go O
there O
. O

You O
go O
there O
f- O
%uh O

do O
n't O
you O
start O
a O

Well O
I O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
the- O

once O
a O

In O
an O
age O
of O
specialization O
, O
the O
federal O
judiciary O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
last O
bastions O
of O
the O
generalist O
. O

A O
judge O
must O
jump O
from O
murder O
to O
antitrust O
cases O
, O
from O
arson O
to O
securities O
fraud O
, O
without O
missing O
a O
beat O
. O

But O
even O
on O
the O
federal O
bench O
, O
specialization O
is O
creeping O
in O
, O
and O
it O
has O
become O
a O
subject O
of O
sharp O
controversy O
on O
the O
newest O
federal O
appeals O
court O
. O

The B-ORG
Court I-ORG
of I-ORG
Appeals I-ORG
for I-ORG
the I-ORG
Federal I-ORG
Circuit I-ORG
was O
created O
in O
1982 B-DATE
to O
serve O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
as O
the O
court O
of O
last O
resort O
for O
most O
patent O
disputes O
. O

Previously O
, O
patent O
cases O
moved O
through O
the O
court O
system O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
12 B-CARDINAL
circuit O
appeals O
courts O
. O

There O
, O
judges O
who O
saw O
few O
such O
cases O
and O
had O
no O
experience O
in O
the O
field O
grappled O
with O
some O
of O
the O
most O
technical O
and O
complex O
disputes O
imaginable O
. O

A O
new O
specialty O
court O
was O
sought O
by O
patent O
experts O
, O
who O
believed O
that O
the O
generalists O
had O
botched O
too O
many O
important O
, O
multimillion B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
dollar I-MONEY
cases O
. O

Some O
patent O
lawyers O
had O
hoped O
that O
such O
a O
specialty O
court O
would O
be O
filled O
with O
experts O
in O
the O
field O
. O

But O
the O
Reagan B-PERSON
administration O
thought O
otherwise O
, O
and O
so O
may O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
. O

Since O
1984 B-DATE
, O
the O
president O
has O
filled O
four B-CARDINAL
vacancies O
in O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Circuit I-ORG
court O
with O
non-patent O
lawyers O
. O

Now B-DATE
only B-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
of O
the O
12 B-CARDINAL
judges O
-- O
Pauline B-PERSON
Newman I-PERSON
, O
Chief O
Judge O
Howard B-PERSON
T. I-PERSON
Markey I-PERSON
, O
68 B-DATE
, O
and O
Giles B-PERSON
Rich I-PERSON
, O
85 B-DATE
-- O
have O
patent O

law O
backgrounds O
. O

The O
latter O
two B-CARDINAL
and O
Judge O
Daniel B-PERSON
M. I-PERSON
Friedman I-PERSON
, O
73 B-CARDINAL
, O
are O
approaching O
senior O
status O
or O
retirement O
. O

Three B-CARDINAL
seats O
currently O
are O
vacant O
and O
three B-CARDINAL
others O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
filled O
within O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
so O
patent O
lawyers O
and O
research O
- O
based O
industries O
are O
making O
a O
new O
push O
for O
specialists O
to O
be O
added O
to O
the O
court O
. O

Several O
organizations O
, O
including O
the B-ORG
Industrial I-ORG
Biotechnical I-ORG
Association I-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
Pharmaceutical I-ORG
Manufacturers I-ORG
Association I-ORG
, O
have O
asked O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
and O
Justice B-ORG
Department I-ORG
to O
name O
candidates O
with O
both O
patent O
and O
scientific O
backgrounds O
. O

The O
associations O
would O
like O
the O
court O
to O
include O
between B-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
judges O
with O
specialized O
training O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
associations O
have O

Dr. O
Lourie B-PERSON
says O
the B-ORG
Justice I-ORG

interviewed O
him O
last B-DATE
July I-DATE
. O

Their O
effort O
has O
received O
a O
lukewarm O
response O
from O
the B-ORG
Justice I-ORG

. O

`` O
We O
do O
not O

'' O
says O
Justice B-ORG
spokesman O
David B-PERSON

who O
declines O

how O

a O

`` O

we O
will O
take O

The B-ORG

Michael B-PERSON

He O
makes O
even O

Jackson B-PERSON

the O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
easily O
one B-CARDINAL

the O

Every O
time O
he O

he O

where O

for O
his O

we O
can O
not O
account O
for O
the O
behavior O
if O
it O
were O
n't O
for O
an O
apparently O
overriding O
need O
to O
confess O
and O
proclaim O
-- O
over O

against O
what O
the O
outside O

the O

The O
on O
- O
going O
spectacle O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
increasingly O
bizarre O
conduct O
is O
his O
confession O
to O
the O
world O
that O
he O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
spectacularly O
psychologically O
- O
challenged O
dude O
. O

Like O
children O
who O
are O
incapable O
of O
dissimulating O
their O
basic O
wants O
and O
needs O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
manner O
of O
being O
in O
the O
world O
is O
uncensored O
and O
spontaneous O
, O

and O
to O
such O
an O
unsuspected O
extent O
I O
propose O
he O
deserves O
to O
be O
considered O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
authentic O
beings O
of O
this O
or O
any O
other O
century O
, O
and O
quite O
properly O
belongs O
to O
that O
exceptional O
society O
of O
authenticity O
- O
questers O
that O
would O
include O
Saint B-PERSON
Augustine I-PERSON
, O
Pascal B-PERSON
and O
Heidegger B-PERSON
. O

The O
facts O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
life O
have O
been O
well O
documented O
. O

We O
know O
that O
by O
the B-DATE
age I-DATE
of I-DATE
25 I-DATE
he O
was O
on O
top O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Thriller B-WORK_OF_ART
had O
sold O
an O
unprecedented O
50 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
copies O
and O
Billie B-WORK_OF_ART
Jean I-WORK_OF_ART
had O
become O
the O
musical O
drug O
of O
choice O
in O
every O
corner O
of O
the O
world O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
song O
's O
momentum O
and O
tension O
brilliantly O
crafted O
and O
fused O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
riveting O
, O
counterpoint O
choreography O
- O
which O
remains O
unsurpassed O
-- O
revolutionized O
the O
way O
we O
simultaneously O
look O
at O
and O
listen O
to O
music O
. O

Before O
disbelieving O
eyes O
, O
his O
torso O
, O
head O
and O
limbs O
supplied O
never O
- O
before O
- O
seen O
anatomical O
rejoinders O
to O
the O
notes O
-- O
like O
a O
guitarist O
filling O
in O
between O
the O
lyrics O
. O

But O
from O
here O
on O
in O
, O
it O
would O
be O
downhill O
for O
the O
genre O
's O
quintessential O
messenger O
, O
for O
Michael B-PERSON
could O
no O
longer O
sustain O
the O
' O
great O
lie O
' O
he O
was O
living O
. O

The O
child O
's O
' O
tin O
drum O
' O
was O
beating O
ever O
louder O
in O
his O
head O

and O
he O
intuitively O
understood O
that O
he O
was O
developmentally O
under O
- O
equipped O
to O
handle O
the O
adult O
pressures O
of O
stardom O
. O

Far O
more O
compelling O
than O
the O
promise O
of O
even O
greater O
fame O
and O
fortune O
was O
the O
example O
of O
Oskar B-PERSON
, O
from O
Gunther B-PERSON

' I-PERSON
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Tin I-WORK_OF_ART
Drum I-WORK_OF_ART
-LRB- O
1959 B-DATE
-RRB- O
, O
which O
tells O
the O
story O
of O
a O
boy O
who O
refuses O
to O
grow O
up O
, O
who O
, O
through O
his O
drumming O
, O
rejects O
the O
adult O
world O
and O
the O
horrors O
taking O
place O
in O
Nazi B-NORP
Germany B-GPE
. O

Like O
Oskar B-PERSON
, O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
witnessed O
firsthand B-ORDINAL
the O
abominations O
of O
adult O
behaviour O
and O
refused O
to O
sign O
up O
. O

From O
his O
earliest O
years O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
Jackson I-PERSON
was O
subjected O
to O
both O
extreme O
psychological O
and O
physical O
abuse O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
his O
status O
- O
obsessed O
father O
, O
who O
designated O
Michael B-PERSON
as O
the O
vessel O
into O
which O
he O
would O
mercilessly O
pour O
the O
acid O
of O
his O
unrealized O
ambitions O
. O

To O
this O
single O
end O
, O
Joe B-PERSON
Jackson I-PERSON
was O
ruthlessly O
single O
- O
minded O
. O

Michael B-PERSON
was O
terrified O
of O
him O
, O
whose O
mere O
presence O
could O
induce O
nausea O
. O

At O
the B-DATE
age I-DATE
of I-DATE
5 I-DATE
, O
the O
father O
yanked O
the O
son O
from O
his O
pail O
and O
sandbox O
existence O
and O
made O
him O
run O
Hollywood B-ORG
's O
grimmest O
gauntlets O
. O

The O
little O
mouse O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
was O
suddenly O
found O
himself O
in O
the O
rat O
race O
and O
quickly O
learned O
to O
hate O
it O
, O

and O
like O
Oskar B-PERSON
, O
who O
found O
respite O
in O
the O
beating O
of O
his O
tin O
drum O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
found O
solace O
on O
stage O
, O
performing O
his O
music O
. O

But O
the O
stage O
could O
not O
provide O
Michael B-PERSON
with O
immunity O
against O
the O
constant O
encroachment O
of O
the O
adult O
world O
. O

Listen O
to O
his O
rapid O
breathing O
in O
especially O
Off B-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Wall I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
Thriller B-WORK_OF_ART
: O
the O
staccato O
- O
like O
panting O
of O
a O
stalked O
animal O
, O
the O
desperate O
breath O
of O
human O
panic O
, O
and O
his O
small O
boy O
's O
voice O
hiding O
behind O
the O
mesmerizing O
slash O
and O
blur O
of O
arms O
and O
legs O
fending O
off O
an O
invisible O
attack O
. O

From O
one B-CARDINAL
track O
to O
the O
next O
, O
the O
lyrics O
are O
n't O
so O
much O
sung O
as O
frantically O
whispered O
, O
the O
vowels O
cut O
short O
to O
the O
quick O
. O

Michael B-PERSON
was O
announcing O
that O
he O
could O
no O
longer O
follow O
the O
course O
Father O
and O
Hollywood B-ORG
had O
staked O
out O
for O
him O
, O
that O
the O
disparity O
between O
his O
real O
self O
and O
the O
role O
he O
was O
thrust O
into O
had O
reached O
unsustainable O
incommensurability O
. O

Only O
the O
child O
within O
could O
save O
the O
defenceless O
adult O
from O
the O
depredations O
of O
the O
adult O
world O
, O

and O
from O
this O
point O
on O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
would O
reduce O
the O
project O
of O
his O
life O
to O
letting O
the O
world O
know O
the O
truth O
of O
who O
he O
was O
: O
a O
confused O
, O
fragile O
, O
lost O
soul O
in O
search O
of O
care O
and O
love O
. O

By O
the O
time O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
attained O
mythic O
status O
, O
he O
was O
so O
far O
removed O
and O
alienated O
from O
himself O
, O
he O
would O
have O
to O
shed O
, O
over O
a O
period O
of O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
still O
counting O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
skin O
after O
another O
before O
his O
true O
self O
could O
begin O
to O
emerge O
. O

As O
we O
might O
expect O
from O
someone O
so O
radically O
self O
- O
estranged O
, O
the O
result O
has O
been O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
metamorphosis O
. O

Michael B-PERSON
's O
journey O
of O
self O
- O
discovery O
is O
a O
work O
in O
progress O
like O
no O
other O
because O
it O
increasingly O
depends O
on O
the O
accommodation O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
irreconcilables O
: O
the O
child O
and O
adult O
as O
one B-CARDINAL
. O

More O
revealing O
of O
itself O
than O
its O
favorite O
target O
, O
public O
opinion O
has O
not O
seen O
fit O
to O
grant O
Michael B-PERSON
the O
inalienable O
right O
to O
his O
confused O
mental O
state O
and O
' O
off O
the O
wall O
' O
comportment O
. O

If O
most O
people O
subscribe O
to O
the O
notion O
that O
black O
and O
white O
are O
not O
only O
skin O
colors O
but O
states O
of O
mind O
, O
why O
are O
we O
baffled O
or O
offended O
when O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
introduced O
to O
the O
white O
ways O
of O
Hollywood B-ORG
at O
the B-DATE
age I-DATE

, O
tells O
us O
that O
he O
is O

sure O
what O
his O
true O
color O
is O
? O

Robbed O
of O
his O
childhood O
, O
abused O
by O
a O
psychotic O
father O
and O
then O
prematurely O
subjected O
to O
the O
adult O
pressures O
of O
the O
entertainment O

why O
are O
we O
surprised O
to O
learn O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
does O
n't O
want O
to O
grow O
up O
, O
that O
he O
prefers O
the O
company O
and O
community O
of O
children O
, O
that O
he O
wants O
to O
be O
protected O
and O

Every O

at O

a O

Either O
way O
, O
the O
overhang O
is O
big O
enough O
to O
keep O
delicately O
balanced O
oil O
markets O
on O
edge O
. O

Even O
modest O
amounts O
of O
additional O
output O
by O
those O
with O
the O
huge O
extra O
capacity O
and O
reserves O
, O
such O
as O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
and O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
could O
upset O
the O
market O
. O

The O
Iraqi B-NORP
oil O
minister O
and O
Saudi B-NORP
oil O
minister O
Hisham B-PERSON
Nazer I-PERSON
insisted O
in O
their O
comments O
to O
the O
conference O
that O
their O
countries O
would O
act O
responsibly O
to O
maintain O
a O
stable O
market O
. O

However O
, O
in O
interviews O
later O
, O
both O
ministers O
stressed O
that O
they O
expect O
future O
OPEC B-ORG
quotas O
to O
be O
based O
mainly O
on O
the O
production O
capacity O
and O
reserves O
of O
each O
member O
. O

Under O
that O
approach O
, O
countries O
with O
the O
most O
unused O
oil O
capacity O
would O
get O
bigger O
shares O
of O
any O
future O
increases O
in O
OPEC B-ORG
's O
production O
ceiling O
than O
they O
would O
under O
the O
current O
system O
. O

`` O
If O
you O
are O
already O
producing O
at O
95 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
or O
100 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
your O
capacity O
, O
what O
's O
the O
good O
to O
be O
told O
you O
can O
produce O
at O
105 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
capacity O
? O
'' O
asked O
Mr. O
Al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Chalabi I-PERSON
. O

At O
an O
inconclusive O
Geneva B-GPE
meeting O
late B-DATE
last I-DATE
month I-DATE
, O
OPEC B-ORG
's O
oil O
ministers O
halfheartedly O
approved O
another O
increase O
of O
one B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
barrels I-QUANTITY
a O
day O
in O
their O
production O
ceiling O
. O

They O
doled O
it O
out O
using O
the O
existing O
formula O
, O
however O
, O
which O
meant O
that O
even O
those O
countries O
that O
could O
n't O
produce O
more O
received O
higher O
official O
allotments O
. O

The O
main O
effect O
of O
the O
ceiling O
boost O
was O
to O
`` O
legitimize O
'' O
some O
of O
the O
overproduction O
already O
coming O
from O
the O
quota O
cheaters O
. O

Still O
, O
there O
was O
a O
breakthrough O
at O
Geneva B-GPE
. O

Previously O
, O
no O
OPEC B-ORG
member O
had O
been O
willing O
to O
accept O
a O
reduction O
in O
its O
percentage O
share O
of O
the O
group O
's O
total O
output O
target O
, O
or O
ceiling O
. O

But O
the O
concept O
of O
disproportionate O
quotas O
for O
those O
with O
unused O
capacity O
, O
advanced O
there O
in O
an O
Iranian B-NORP
proposal O
, O
was O
generally O
endorsed O
by O
the O
ministers O
. O

In O
the O
end O
politics O
got O
in O
the O
way O
. O

Libya B-GPE
accepted O
Iran B-GPE
's O
proposal O
only O
so O
long O
as O
it O
was O
promised O
production O
parity O
with O
Kuwait B-GPE
. O

And O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
Arab I-GPE
Emirates I-GPE
, O
a O
chronic O
quota O
cheater O
, O
refused O
to O
give O
any O
guarantee O
it O
would O
change O
its O
ways O
. O

But O
the O
oil O
ministers O
continue O
to O
study O
the O
plan O
, O
and O
it O
will O
probably O
be O
the O
basis O
for O
discussion O
at O
next B-DATE
month I-DATE
's I-DATE
meeting O
. O

It O
's O
understood O
several O
compromises O
already O
have O
been O
worked O
into O
the O
plan O
. O

The O
ceiling O
would O
be O
lifted O
to O
21.5 B-QUANTITY
million I-QUANTITY
barrels I-QUANTITY
to O
provide O
Kuwait B-GPE
and O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
Arab I-GPE
Emirates I-GPE
much O
higher O
official O
quotas O
while O
reducing O
percentage O
shares O
of O
some O
others O
. O

Libya B-GPE
's O
previous O
conditions O
are O
no O
longer O
considered O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
Arab I-GPE
Emirates I-GPE
is O
still O
an O
issue O
. O

Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
, O
OPEC B-ORG

kingpin O
, O
also O
has O
surfaced O
as O
a O
possible O
obstacle O
, O
some O
OPEC B-ORG

said O
. O

Insisting O
on O
a O
24.5 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
share O
of O
any O

, O
Saudi B-NORP
officials O
have O
long O
pressed O
for O
the O
pro O

distribution O
of O
increases O
to O
all O
members O
. O

In O
Geneva B-GPE
, O
however O
, O
they O
supported O
Iran B-GPE
's O
proposal O
because O
it O
would O
have O
left O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
percentage O
of O
the O
OPEC B-ORG
total O
intact O
, O
and O
increased O
actual O
Saudi B-NORP

to O
nearly B-QUANTITY
5.3 I-QUANTITY

from O
five B-CARDINAL

Mr. O

the O

The O

the O

the B-ORG

of I-ORG
Grand I-ORG
Justices I-ORG
in O
this O
case O

the O
crux O
of O
the O

is O
about O
the O
use O
of O
democratic O

in O

and O
should O
not O
be O
seen O
as O
an O

The O
role O
of O
the O
judiciary O
in O
this O
case O
, O
says O
Su B-PERSON
, O
was O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O

the O
authority O
to O
suspend O

of O
a O

. O

In O
industrialized O

, O
changes O
in O
policy O

nuclear O

are O
a O
common O
occurrence O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O

Hsu B-PERSON
notes O
that O
while O
the O
ruling O
pointed O
to O
procedural O
flaws O
in O
the O
Cabinet B-ORG

action O
, O
the O
ruling O
said O
nothing O
about O
any O
violation O
of O
the O
constitution O
or O
the O
law O
. O

The O
Grand O
Justices O
, O
argues O
Hsu B-PERSON
, O
felt O
that O
the O

could O
be O
resolved O
by O
having O
the O

present O

the O

, O
or O
through O
consultations O
between O
the O

However O
, O
said O
Hsu B-PERSON
, O
since O
the O

has O
not O
necessarily O
built O
up O
a O
consensus O
in O
support O
of O
its O

against O

, O
another O
option O
might O

to O
have O
the O

resign O

disband O
the O

and O
elect O
a O

so O
that O

If O

it O

flooded O
in O
Al B-LOC

Rashidiya I-LOC
in O

The O
reason O
for O
the O
flooding O
was O
n't O
the O
rain O
that O
fell O
in O
the O
Emirates B-GPE

rather O
because O
of O

My O

Well O
, O
five B-TIME

how O
do O
you O
two O
experts O
appraise O
our O
, O
um O
, O
Chinese B-NORP
companies O
and O
foreign O
companies O
at O

What O
kind O

description O
is O
applied O
to O
them O
. O

Can O
they O
still O
be O
described O
as O
wolves O
. O

Director O
Zhang B-PERSON
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
. O

Er O
, O
I O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
like O
this O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
I O
think O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
wolves O
as O
%pw O
, O
description O
and O
appraisal O
, O
is O
, O
I O
think O
, O
a O
very O
good O
appraisal O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
after O
the O
wolves O
have O
arrived O
-- O
it O
actually O
describes O
a O
so O
- O
called O
arrival O
of O
the O
wolves O
, O
which O
is O
also O
the O
arrival O
of O
powerful O
competitors O
, O
right O
. O

So O
I O
think O
this O
appraisal O
is O
still O
quite O
good O
. O

Yeah O
. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
uh O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
um O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
five I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
uh O
, O
following O
our O
accession O
to O
the O
WTO B-ORG
, O
we O
have O
been O
dancing O
with O
wolves O
. O

That O
is O
, O
since O
the O
wolves O
' O
arrival O
, O
uh O
, O
we O
have O
been O
actually O
adapting O
ourselves O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
wolves O
while O
dancing O
with O
them O
, O
as O
well O
as O
growing O
bigger O
and O
more O
powerful O
ourselves O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
I O
find O
, O
um O
, O
this O
very O
, O
er O
, O
interesting O
, O
and O
it O
also O
just O
occurred O
to O
me O
, O
that O
, O
a O
, O
a O
few O
days O
ago O
we O
went O
to O
some O
Chinese B-NORP
companies O
to O
do O
some O
surveys O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Haier B-ORG
, O
when O
companies O
like O
Haier B-ORG
, O
Lenovo B-ORG
, O
and O
Huawei B-ORG
go O
abroad O
, O
in O
fact O
others O
also O
see O
it O
as O
an O
arrival O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
wolves O
, O
who O
are O
seen O
as O
immature O
yet O
equally O
capable O
of O
biting O
people O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

So O
this O
, O
uh O
, O
personally O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
arrival O
of O
, O
um O
, O
the O
wolves O
to O
be O
that O
horrible O
, O
though O
it O
is O
indeed O
wolf O
- O
like O
. O

It O
also O
reminds O
me O
of O
something O
that O
I O
experienced O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
also O
related O
to O
an O
airport O
and O
meeting O
people O
. O

A B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
my O
neighbor O
approached O
me O
to O
borrow O
my O
car O
, O
saying O
he O
was O
meeting O
his O
parents O
at O
the O
airport O
. O

He O
also O
said O
both O
his O
wife O
and O
children O
wanted O
to O
go O
. O

As O
his O
car O
was O
too O
small O
and O
mine O
was O
big O
, O
it O
could O
make O
his O
parents O
more O
comfortable O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
would O
only O
use O
it O
for O
one B-TIME
morning I-TIME
and O
would O
return O
it O
to O
me O
before O
noon B-TIME
. O

Although O
there O
was O
only O
a O
nodding O
acquaintance O
between O
the O
neighbor O
and O
me O
, O
we O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
apartment O
building O
after O
all O
and O
were O
both O
Chinese B-NORP
. O

So O
I O
discussed O
with O
my O
wife O
back O
home O
and O
lent O
him O
the O
car O
as O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
not O
be O
using O
the O
car O
until O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O

And O
then O
something O
happened O
... O

At O
1:00pm B-TIME
, O
the O
neighbor O
called O
me O
, O
saying O
he O
took O
his O
parents O
to O
a O
buffet O
and O
would O
probably O
not O
to O
be O
back O
until O
around O
3:00pm B-TIME
. O

I O
of O
course O
agreed O
and O
asked O
them O
not O
to O
rush O
. O

This O
wait O
lasted O
till O
5:30pm B-TIME
, O
when O
the O
neighbor O
told O
me O
in O
a O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
crying O
tone O
that O
there O
was O
an O
accident O
, O
and O
everyone O
else O
was O
intact O
, O
except O
his O
father O
, O
who O
was O
in O
hospital O
for O
fractures O
. O

I O
comforted O
him O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
asked O
my O
friend O
to O
rush O
me O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

My O
neighbor O
showed O
me O
the O
police O
report O
at O
the O
hospital O
, O
which O
indicated O
it O
was O
all O
my O
neighbor O
's O
fault O
. O

He O
clashed O
into O
a O
truck O
going O
straight O
when O
he O
made O
a O
left O
turn O
. O

My O
car O
was O
completely O
damaged O
and O
had O
been O
towed O
away O
. O

I O
forced O
myself O
to O
refrain O
from O
the O
grief O
of O
loosing O
my O
beloved O
car O
-LRB- O
mine O
was O
liability O
- O
only O
coverage O
-RRB- O
and O
asked O
the O
friend O
to O
send O
their O
family O
home O
. O

And O
then O
the O
nightmare O
began O
. O

The B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
my O
neighbor O
called O
me O
, O
saying O
his O
father O
needed O
to O
undergo O
an O
operation O
in O
hospital O
and O
asked O
where O
the O
money O
would O
come O
from O

I O
told O
him O
part O
would O
be O
covered O
by O
my O
car O
insurance O
. O

After O
a O
while O
, O
he O
called O
again O
, O
saying O
the O
operation O
charge O
was O
high O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
afford O

I O
tried O
my O
best O
to O
comfort O
him O
then O
and O
told O
him O
to O
think O
of O
a O
way O
slowly O

Just O
then O
, O
a O
nearly O
crazy O
voice O
of O
a O
woman O
came O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
line O
, O
saying O
her O
family O
had O
just O
saved O
several B-MONEY
dozen I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
bucks I-MONEY
for O
the O
down O
payment O
of O
a O
house O
; O
where O
would O
they O
live O
afterwards O
if O
they O
spent O
this O
. O

She O
also O
said O
my O
car O
was O
a O
Japanese B-NORP
one O
, O
which O
had O
poor O
safety O
performance O
and O
it O
was O
my O
car O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
car O
accident O
. O

She O
added O
that O
I O
should O
pay O
the O
money O
because O
the O
car O
was O
mine O
. O

I O
hung O
up O
the O
phone O
angrily O
as O
the O
dialog O
could O
not O
go O
on O
. O

My O
wife O
-LSB- O
pw% O
-RSB- O
had O
been O
persuading O
me O
aside O
, O
saying O
some O
women O
would O
easily O
lose O
mind O
once O
in O
fury O
. O

She O
asked O
me O
to O
take O
no O
heed O
of O
them O
and O
let O
them O
calm O
down O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

So O
I O
did O
n't O
take O
their O
words O
seriously O
but O
still O
felt O
angry O
. O

Out O
of O
my O
expectation O
, O
a O
phone O
call O
on O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
day O
completely O
changed O
my O
original O
idea O
. O

The O
telephone O
rang O
just O
as O
I O
was O
about O
to O
go O
to O
work O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
sales O
call O
and O
was O
prepared O
to O
end O
it O
perfunctorily O
. O

Unexpectedly O
, O
coming O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
line O
was O
a O
deep O
and O
resolute O
voice O
of O
a O
middle O
- O
aged O
man O
. O

He O
said O
in O
an O
incontestable O
tone O
that O
my O
neighbor O
had O
a O
car O
accident O
as O
a O
result O
of O
borrowing O
my O
car O
, O
which O
traumatized O
them O
both O
physically O
and O
mentally O
and O
harmed O
their O
economic O
interests O
, O
and O
as O
the O
car O
owner O
, O
they O
would O
not O
sue O
me O
if O
I O
compensated O
them O
for O
the O
hospital O
charge O
and O
the O
costs O
of O
missing O
work O
hours O
-LRB- O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
-RRB- O
, O
otherwise O
they O
would O
see O
me O
in O
court O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
was O
certain O
about O
the O
case O
as O
a O
lawyer O
in O
business O
for O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
the O
compensation O
he O
requested O
could O
double O
in O
court O
. O

As O
a O
great O
Chinese B-NORP
guy O
, O
how O
could O
I O
be O
scared O
by O
a O
few O
remarks O
of O
the O
lawyer O
? O

I O
also O
took O
up O
the O
weapon O
of O
law O
for O
justice O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
also O
retained O
a O
lawyer O
. O

Out O
of O
my O
expectation O
, O
my O
lawyer O
solved O
the O
problem O
by O
merely O
making O
two B-CARDINAL
phone O
calls O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
was O
to O
the O
police O
station O
, O
asking O
for O
any O
additional O
findings O
in O
the O
investigation O
report O
of O
the O
accident O
. O

There O
was O
additional O
findings O
unexpectedly O
, O
which O
were O
against O
them O
. O

Someone O
at O
the O
junk O
yard O
found O
a O
bottle O
of O
unfinished O
wine O
without O
the O
lid O
inside O
the O
car O
and O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
police O
station O
. O

The O
police O
found O
they O
put O
the O
bottle O
of O
unfinished O
wine O
in O
the O
car O
without O
the O
lid O
after O
lunch O
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
call O
was O
to O
their O
lawyer O
. O

So O
their O
lawyer O
dropped O
the O
lawsuit O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
would O
not O
stop O
it O
there O
and O
came O
to O
discuss O
with O
me O
several O
times O
, O
sometimes O
honey O
- O
tongued O
and O
sometimes O
threatening O
. O

The O
most O
classic O
one O
was O
: O
Do O
n't O
ever O
dream O
of O
living O
a O
life O
back O
to O
China B-GPE
, O
as O
we O
have O
people O
across O
the O
country O
. O

Disgusting O
! O

Here O
comes O
the O
old O
topic O
again O
, O
are O
you O
going O
to O
lend O
your O
car O
if O
your O
neighbor O
or O
friend O
asks O
. O

I O
think O
many O
people O
will O
say O
they O
wo O
n't O
. O

I O
would O
suggest O
not O
to O
lend O
online O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Internet O
is O
after O
all O
virtual O
. O

Words O
sometimes O
have O
no O
emotions O
. O

When O
your O
seemingly O
nice O
neighbor O
, O
seemingly O
close O
friend O
, O
or O
a O
girl O
whose O
eyes O
can O
speak O
asks O
for O
it O
in O
the O
real O
world O
, O
how O
many O
people O
will O
answer O
with O
a O
" O
no O
? O
" O

Anyhow O
, O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I O
lent O
my O
car O
to O
some O
people O
in O
need O
after O
that O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
there O
are O
not O
many O
people O
like O
my O
former O
neighbor O
couple O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
here O
is O
a O
summery O
of O
the O

Saddam B-PERSON
's O
last B-ORDINAL
days O
and O
what O
is O
said O
he O
was O
like O

Bu B-PERSON
Thari I-PERSON

What O
we O
know O
about O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
is O
that O
he O
had O
changed O
a O
lot O
. O

He O
had O
Islamic B-NORP
tendecies O
and O
acts O
which O
many O
Iraqis B-NORP
mentioned O
, O
saying O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
supported O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
the O
building O
of O
mosques O
centers O
for O
memorizing O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
charities O
, O
and O
the O
dancer O
's O
punishment O
was O
death O
. O

He O
had O
many O
works O
. O

But O
some O
explained O
his O
Islamic B-PERSON
tendency O
by O
saying O
that O
he O
was O
currying O
favor O
with O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
as O
if O
they O
were O
reading O
his O
mind O
. O

I O
have O
followed O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
, O
especially O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
I O
noticed O
about O
him O
was O
that O
there O
was O
religion O
but O
there O
was O
injustice O
and O
coarseness O
. O

And O
his O
punishment O
was O
unjust O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
dancer O
would O
be O
killed O
after O
second B-ORDINAL
offence O
. O

I O
did O
not O
expect O
anyone O
to O
kill O
the O
dancer O
unless O
good O
would O
come O
of O
it O
, O
but O
like O
the O
most O
idiots O
his O
aim O
was O
correct O
but O
the O
method O
was O
wrong O
. O

Another O
example O
- O
after O
his O
son O
Udai B-PERSON
harmed O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
and O
attacked O
women O
and O
other O
matters O
, O
Saddam B-PERSON
ordered O
him O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
he O
was O
fired O
on O
but O
survived O
miraculously O
, O
after O
being O
hit O
with O
several O
fatal O
shots O
some O
of O
which O
hit O
his O
spine O
. O

This O
is O
a O
sign O
that O
there O
was O
good O
in O
him O
otherwise O
he O
would O
not O
have O
ordered O
the O
killing O
of O
his O
son O
, O
his O
own O
child O
. O

But O
he O
was O
not O
a O
scholar O
nor O
feared O
in O
God O
. O

I O
myself O
heard O
from O
some O
people O
who O
were O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
about O
the O
things O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
used O
to O
do O
, O
and O
could O
not O
be O
reasonably O
done O
by O
anyone O
other O
than O
a O
good O
Moslem B-NORP
To O
the O
extent O
that O
many O
said O
of O
his O
actions O
that O
they O
were O
only O
to O
gain O
favor O
amongst O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
and O
the O
religious O
. O

But O
we O
judge O
by O
the O
appearances O
and O
his O
end O
was O
in O
line O
with O
the O
appearance O
. O

In O
his O
last B-ORDINAL
days O
during O
the O
fall O
of O
Baghdad B-GPE
and O
his O
disappearance O
, O
an O
old O
woman O
or O
man O
said O
on O
TV O
on O
al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Jazeera I-ORG
channel O
that O
he O
was O
hiding O
in O
her O
house O
and O
had O
had O
his O
prayer O
mat O
with O
him O
and O
was O
always O
praying O
and O
reading O
the O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Do O
we O
say O
no O
, O
this O
is O
hypocrisy O
? O

Bear O
in O
mind O
that O
many O
have O
said O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
prayed O
regularly O
especially O
after O
he O
was O
put O
in O
prison O
by O
the O
Rafida B-PERSON
and O
their O
masters O
. O

Some O
of O
those O
who O
said O
that O
he O
was O
always O
praying O
and O
reading O
the O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
are O
the O
Christians B-NORP
who O
visited O
him O
in O
his O
prison O
cell O
. O

Finally O
, O
during O
his O
hanging O
, O
the O
Rafida B-PERSON
tried O
to O
distract O
him O
and O
keep O
him O
from O
saying O
the O
Creed O
before O
his O
death O
. O

They O
were O
trying O
everything O
they O
could O
but O
we O
say O
that O
God O
made O
him O
steadfast O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
to O
see O
that O
he O
died O
acknowledging O
God O
. O

The O
Rafida B-PERSON
were O
shouting O
provocative O
words O
such O
as O
Muqtada B-PERSON
and O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
so O
that O
he O
would O
lose O
control O
and O
curse O
them O
, O
then O
they O
would O
have O
killed O
him O
. O

So O
they O
could O
show O
the O
clip O
in O
which O
there O
is O
cursing O
and O
insults O
from O
Saddam B-PERSON
and O
cut O
the O
rest O
. O

However O
he O
remained O
steadfast O
in O
saying O
the O
creed O
and O
was O
killed O
whilst O
saying O
it O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
this O
could O
n't O
have O
happened O
without O
God O
making O
him O
steadfast O
otherwise O
God O
would O
not O
have O
made O
him O
steadfast O
in O
it O
. O

As O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
sheikhs O
says O
, O
many O
people O
when O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
say O
the O
creed O
and O
were O
being O
dictated O
the O
creed O
by O
those O
present O
would O
murmur O
" O
Did O
love O
see O
drunkards O
? O
" O

Other O
people O
say O
, O
I O
have O
not O
said O
it O
while O
I O
was O
alive O
and O
you O
want O
me O
to O
say O
it O
when O
I O
am O
dying O
... O
the O
truth O
is O
what O
is O
apparent O
. O

But O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
was O
reasonable O
in O
that O
he O
repented O
and O
turned O
to O
his O
creator O
who O
receives O
the O
repentance O
from O
his O
slave O
. O

And O
he O
committed O
himself O
to O
the O
worship O
of O
God O
. O
And O
remained O
loyal O
to O
God O
. O

I O
ask O
God O
to O
have O
mercy O
on O
him O
and O
to O
forgive O
him O
and O
to O
give O
him O
an O
ample O
dwelling O
in O
his O
paradise O
and O
guide O

rest O

I O
recall O
the O
Republican B-NORP
and O
Readjuster B-NORP
movement O
failed O
then O
, O
too O
. O

The O
beauty O
of O
democracy O
is O
that O
people O
get O
the O
government O
they O
deserve O
. O

We O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
drank O
the B-PRODUCT
Kool I-PRODUCT

aid I-PRODUCT
and O
elected O
a O
bunch O
of O

warrior O
idealogues O
instead O
of O
good O
, O
pragmatic O
stewards O
. O

We O
get O
what O
we O
deserve O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
imperil O
our O
bond O
rating O
than O
to O
pass O
a O
budget O
that O
continues O
the O
taxation O
practices O
of O
the O
past O
two B-CARDINAL
general B-ORG
assemblies I-ORG
. O

I O
patently O
reject O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
only O
way O
out O
of O
this O
morass O
is O
to O
pass O
a O
budget O
that O
has O
a O
net O
tax O
increase O
. O

We O
have O
to O
get O
off O
this O
tax O
and O
spend O
merry O
- O
go O
- O
round O
. O

It O
's O
time O
we O
Republicans B-NORP
return O
to O
our O
roots O
of O
fiscal O
conservancy O
. O

Anon O

I O
was O
being O

that O

I O
agree O

that O

the B-DATE

The O

It O
just O
gave O

up O

Update O
: O
Reason O
prevailed O
on O
the B-LAW

the O

off O
a O

at O

that O

Otherwise O
that O

To O

, O
it O
sounds O
like O
a O

to O
me O

After O
seeing O
the O
list O
of O
what O
would O
not O
be O
open O
and O
/ O
or O
on O
duty O
... O
which O
I O
'm O
also O
quite O
sure O
is O
not O
complete O
... O
I O
'll O
go O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
.... O
and O
predict O
... O
that O
this O
will O
not O
happen O

and O
what O
is O
really O
going O
on O
is O
the O
GA B-ORG
equivalent O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
cars O
speeding O
towards O
each O
other O
until O
someone O
blinks O
. O

I O
'll O
also O
predict O
... O
that O
the O
classic O
fall O
- O
back O
position O
for O
Virginia B-GPE
is O
the O
same O
one O
used O
by O
the O

- O

continue O
the O

using O
last O
budget O

... O
continuing O
resolution O
and O
all O
that O
stuff O
. O

On O
the O
actual O
issue O
of O
how O
much O
tax O
is O
enough O
- O
I O
find O
myself O
influenced O
by O
both O
sides O
' O
arguments O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O

but O
I O
guess O
what O
I O
can O
not O
understand O
is O
that O
all O
things O
being O
equal O
.. O
does O
n't O
population O
growth O
result O
in O
MORE O
tax O
revenues O
that O
would O
be O
allocated O
presumedly O
as O
they O
were O
before O
- O
in O
other O
words O
priorities O
remain O
the O
same O
in O
terms O
of O
allocations O
? O

If O
everyone O
- O
those O
already O
here O
plus O
our O
population O
growth O
is O
to O
pay O
HIGHER O
taxes O
- O
should O
there O
be O
an O
expectation O
on O
the O
part O
of O
taxpayers O
to O
receive O
MORE O
services O
... O
and O
of O
course O
.... O
what O
about O
those O
that O
are O
opposed O
to O
the O
government O
providing O
services O
that O
private O
industry O
could O
do O
- O
for O
less O
. O

This O
certainly O
goes O
for O
transportation O
where O
we O
talk O
about O
a O
`` O
crisis O
'' O
that O
can O
ONLY O
be O
solved O
by O
higher O

more O

believe O
that O

rise O
this B-DATE

the O

once O

Also O

be O
gainfully O
employed O
. O

But O
anyway O
, O

a- O
and O
you O
can O
think O
about O
that O
pregnancy O
thing O

oh O
yeah O

that O
pregnancy O
thing O

yeah O

that O

do O
the O

Maybe O
that O
's O
your O
there O
's O
your O
hormones O
calling O
. O

yeah O

well O
no O

the O
funny O
thing O
is O
it O
's O
like O
ten O
years O
ago O
I O
would O
've O
said O
oh O
yeah O
that O
was O
what O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
be O
doing O
is O
having O
a O
baby O
you O
know O

but O
like O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
we O
're O
going O
to O
do O
it O
because O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
%uh O
%eh O
you O
know O
in B-DATE
the I-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
we O
'd O
regret O
it O
you O
know O

we O
we O
figure O
it O
's O
something O
we O
'd O
want O
to O
do O

it O
's O
not O
like O
we O
're O
doing O
it O
because O
we O
have O
to O
do O
it O
or O
there O
's O
peer O
pressure O

or O
well O
a O
little O
%mm O
little O
peer O
pressure O

oh O
no O
no O
no O

I O
yea- O
I O
know O
exactly O
where O
you O
're O
at O
because O
I O
think O
about O
that O
too O

I O
got O
about O
like O
six B-CARDINAL
or O
seven B-DATE
years I-DATE

I O
figure O
my O
body O
is O
a O
very O
slow O
%um O
yeah O
**maturer** O

you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O

like O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
my O
period O
until O
I O
was O
sixteen B-DATE

I O
do O
n't O
look O
yeah O
%mm O
e- O
I O
mean O
I O
look O
like O
about O
%uh O
%uh O
at O
least O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
younger O
than O
I O
actually O
am O

-- O
and O
I O
'm O
just O
starting O
to O
get O
my O
period O
actually O
now O
-- O
yeah O
yeah O
as O
an O
adult O
. O

So O
I O
kind O
of O
figure O
well O
I O
must O
I O
I O
'm O
probably O
I O
'm O
probably O
good O
until O
at O
least O
some O
time O
in O
the B-DATE
early I-DATE
forties I-DATE

and O
I O
could O
probably O
go O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
that O

I O
know O
there O
's O
a O
risk O
and O
all O
that O
bullshit O

yeah O
. O

but O
%um O
yeah O
I O
think O
about O
that O
too O
because O
it O
's O
like O
I O
mean O
I O
I O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
way O
things O
are O
going O
in O
the O
in O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
responsibility O
. O

I O
know O

well O
I O
mean O
that O
's O
the O
thing O

kids O
are O
cute O
and O
all O
that O

and O
I O
was O
just O
we O
we O
%mm O
slept O
until O
noon B-TIME

we O
got O
up O
about B-TIME
ten I-TIME
and O
was O
like O
oh O
we O
have O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
played O
with O
the O
cats O
fell O
back O
to O
sleep O

okay O
I O
mean O
we O
're O
talking O
total O
slackers O

%mm O

and O
I O
thought O
gee O
you O
know O
if O
we O
had O
a O
kid O
w- O
we O
could O
n't O
do O
this O
you O
know O

and O

%mm O

No O

you O
got O
to O
be O
focused O
on O
that O

and O
I O
wa- O
I O
mean O
there O
's O
a O
lots O
of O
other O
things O
that O

I O
mean O
as O
far O
as O
like O
living O
situation O
I O
I O
was O
feeling O
kind O
of O
settled O
you O
know O
like O
-- O
Right O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
be O
like O
traipsing O
around O

but O
I O
mean O
I O
could O
say O
that O
for O
the O
next O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
even O
eight B-CARDINAL
or O
maybe O
-- O
y- O
yeah O
. O
-- O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
alright O

ev- O
even O
if O
I O
could O
project O
that O
far O
which O
I O
really O
ca O
n't O

yeah O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
got O
a O
kid O
you O
ca O
n't O
do O
fucking O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
w- O
-- O

I O
know O
. O

-- O
it O
's O
like O
cool O
I O
think O
I O
'll O
go O
off O
to O
the O
Orient B-LOC
and O
start O
like O
bouncing O
from O
country O
country O
. O

I O
know O

well O
and O
I O
mean O
okay O
Emory B-PERSON

to O
get O
his O
doctorate O

so O
we O
'll O
know O
next O
Spring O
if O
he O
can O
get O
at O
least O
accepted O
into O
the O
program O
which O
hopefully O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
you O
know O

and O
then O
then O
there O
's O
four B-CARDINAL
or O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
doing O
the O
damn O

%mm O
. O
He O
's O
crazy O

he O
wants O
it O

that O
's O
fine O

he O
can O
do O
it O

no O
problem O

but O
%um O
that O
sort O
of O
ties O
us O
up O
here O
although O
we O
like O
the O
place O

we O
're O
in O
no O
hurry O
to O
leave O
it O

yeah O
. O

and O
that O
would O
be O
good O

But O
then O
you O
know O
what O
if O
he O
could O
get O
a O
position O
overseas O
again O
which O
is O
something O
both O
of O
us O
have O
said O
would O
be O
pretty O
darn O
good O
because O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
%um O
you O
know O
we O
're O
a- O
after O
after O
coming O
back O
from O
Spain O
from O
those B-DATE
two I-DATE
and I-DATE
half I-DATE
years I-DATE
it O
was O
n't O
so O
much O
an O
adjustment O
to O
the O
way O
things O
were O

it O
's O
just O
asking O
the O
question O
gee O
do O
we O
really O
like O
%um O
the O
way O
things O
are O
over O
here O
with O
the O
lifestyle O
the O
nine B-CARDINAL
to O
five B-CARDINAL
kind O
of O
thing O

I O
mean O
I O
'm O
really O
in O
the O
nine B-CARDINAL
to O
five B-CARDINAL
thing O
more O
so O
than O
he O
is O

he O
you O
know O
he O
should O
be O
there O
by O
oh O
oh O
well O
let O
's O
say O
eight B-TIME
thirty I-TIME
to O
nine B-TIME

but O
yeah O

he O
does O
n't O
care O
when O

well O
okay O

%um O
and O
his O
professor O
is O
obviously O
%uh O
%uh O
a O
great O
person O
to O
work O
for O

so O
I O
'm O
I O
'm O
envious O

but O
%um O
whatever O

I O
'm O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
caught O
up O
%mm O
. O
-- O
in O
it O

and O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
you O
know O

too O
many O
days O
I O
'm O
I O
'm O
working O
and O
and O
eating O
at O
my O
desk O
at O
about B-TIME
twelve I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME

and O
I O
'm O
thinking O
%mm O
. O
This O
is O
crazy O
you O
know O

in O
Spain B-GPE
%uh O
we O
had O
this O
break O

and O
you O
sat O

you O
talked O
to O
people O
you O
know O

you O
enjoyed O
your O
food O

you O
relaxed O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
you O
know O

and O
it O
's O
a O
fairly O
productive O
nation O
right O
you O
know O

What O
's O
going O
on O
here O
? O

yeah O

you O
have O
to O
yeah O
. O
I O
mean O
you O
have O
to O
like O
look O
at O
like O
both O
ad- O
I O
mean O
they O
both O
have O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O

what O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
concentrate O
on O
the O
advantages O
in O
what O
oth- O
ever O
place O
you O
're O
in O
-- O
mhm O
-- O
and O
think O
about O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
the O
place O
that O
you O
're O
not O
in O
. O

yeah O

Otherwise O
you O
go O
nuts O
right O
? O

That O
's O
true O
, O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
Laura B-PERSON
tried O
to O

%uh O
because O
we O
have O
email O
and O
and O
so O
she O
sent O
me O
a O
letter O
back O
saying O
you O
know O
remember O
how O
crowded O
the O
transportation O
is O
and O
%uh O
what O
else O
-- O
%mm O
. O
how O
expensive O
everything O
is O

and O
%uh O
I- O
you O
know O
I O
remember O
those O
things O
of O
course O
you O
know O
-- O

And O
you O
work O
you O
know O
possibilities O
were O
a O
lot O
more O
limited O

True O
. O

and O
the O
language O
you O
know O
yeah O
. O
constantly O
like O
kind O
of O

like O
I O
mean O
those O
could O
be O
p- O
considered O
positive O
things O
as O
well O

yeah O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
mind O
as O
well O
think O
of O
them O
in O
a O
negative O
vie- O
rather O
than O

mhm O
sure O

They O
just O
like O
worrying O
over O
them O
. O

Well O
you O
know O
and O
that O
's O
why O
I O
'm O
I O
I O
it O
helps O
to O
have O
kind O
of O
a O
glimpse O
into O
the O
future O
right O
? O

And O
that O
's O
how O
that O
's O
how O
we O
got O
to O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
Spain B-GPE
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
is O
we O
said O
we O
wanted O
to O
live O
abroad O
and O
we O
would O
try O
to O
do O
it O
you O
know O
as O
teachers O

and O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
way O
because O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
we O
had O
this O
idea O
of O

and O
I O
I O
really O
feel O
that O
that O
's O
important O

and O
so O
what O
I O
'm O
having O
an O
idea O
of O
now O
is O

okay O
you O
know O
Emory B-PERSON
works O
on O
his O
doctorate O

it O
takes O
about O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE

we O
have O
the O
kid O
probably O

we O
he O
gets O
a O
research O
position O
somewhere O
in O
France B-GPE
or O
in O
Spain B-GPE
%um O

and O
then O
we O
move O
over O
there O

and O
you O
know O
I O
take O
care O
of O
the O
kid O
and O
and O
do O
some O
you O
know O
little O
day O
labor O
whatever O
you O
know O

we O
'll O
see O

%mm O
. O

%um O
and O
we O
have O
relatively O
mellow O
life O
for O
who O
knows O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE

and O
then O
we O
take O
it O
from O
there O
. O

yeah O

because O
even O
like O
you O
know O
I O
mean O
all O
that O
stuff O
right O
is O
is O
all O
so O
subject O
to O
whatever O
change O
in O
the O
weather O
that O
happens O
to O
be O
right O
? O

mhm O
. O

oh O
I O
know O

I O
know O

And O
and O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
what O
I O
think O
because O
I O
get O
like O
the O
same O
I O
get O
the O
same O
as O
you O

like O
some O
days O
it O
's O
just O
kind O
of O
like O
you O
know O
what O
the O
hell O
am O
I O
doing O
not O
not O
with O
my O
life O
but O
ge- O

but O
I O
mean O
just O
what O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O
like O
what O
like O
where O
do O
I O
get O
the O
animal O
to O
to O
just O
you O
know O
to O
do O
anything O
you O
know O

I O
just O
lay O
in O
bed O
and O
dream O
for O
for O
the O
whole O
day O
easily O

yeah O

I O
know O
. O

Well O
I O
I O
know O

I O
know O
what O
you O
're O
saying O

I O
I O
feel O
there O
's O
sort O
of O
a O
a O
line O
to O
cross O
too O
between O
really O
planning O
it O
out O
and O
worry O
and O
stressing O
over O
it O
because O
for O
a O
while O
a O
couple O
months O
back O
there O
I O
was O
thinking O
in O
terms O
of O
oh O
gosh O
you O
know O
can O
we O
ever O
afford O
a O
house O

%mm O
. O

and O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
sort O
of O
looked O
at O
it O
financially O
and O
said O
is O
this O
what O
we O
really O
want O
to O
be O
worrying O
about O
right O
now O

and O
you O
know O
I O
realize O
no O

yeah O
absolutely O
. O

and O
and O
so O
you O
know O
you O
can O
sort O
of O
focus O
too O
much O
on O
the O
future O

or O
I O
I O
know O
I O
have O
this O
tendency O
to O
do O
that O
. O

And O
miss O
the O
present O
completely O

I O
mean O
miss O
like O
you O
know O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
goddamn O
onions O
frying O
in O
the O
pan O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O
and O
e- O
each O
little O

I O
mean O
i- O
it O
's O
like O
as O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
there O
's O
like O
no O
pleasure O
that O
's O
as O
intense O
as O
the O
one O
that O
you O
are O
experiencing O
at O
that O
moment O
you O
know O

you O
can O
think O
about O
what O
something O
might O
be O
like O
or O
reminisce O
about O
the O
past O

but O
like O
when O
you O
're O
there O
in O
that O
moment O
it O
's O

I O
mean O
everything O
else O
just O
kind O
of O
like O

it O
's O
almost O
like O
time O
does O
n't O
exist O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O
know O

yeah O

Well O
I O
I O
know O
one O
of O
the O
best O
moments O
I O
can O
recall O
in O
these B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
months I-DATE
is O

okay O
I O
get O
the O
late O
I O
get O
to O
work O
a O
little O
bit O
late O
which O
is O
common O

and O
they O
do O
n't O
really O
care O
since O
I O
'm O
an O
hourly O
you O
know O

you O
have O
to O
be O
within O
a O
certain O
time O
frame O

%mm O
. O

and O
so O
everyone O
else O
is O
parked O
. O

I O
'm O
way O
out O
there O
in O

parking O
lot O
closer O
to O
where O
the O
trees O
are O

and O
I O
you O
know O

close O
the O
door O

I O
just O
take O
a O
deep O
breath O
as O
I O
go O
okay O
another O
day O

and O
I O
hear O
the O
birds O
singing O
-- O

yeah O
. O

and O
I O
just O
stop O
for O
a O
minute O
and O
listen O
to O
the O
birds O

and O
that O
's O
that O
it O
sort O
of O
cheers O
me O
up O

it O
I O
you O
know O
I O
realize O
what O
a O
minute O
okay O

that O
nasty O
sterile O
office O
where O
the O
windows O
do O
n't O
even O
open O
-- O

%eh O
%um O
I O
will O
be O
for O
the O
next B-TIME

but O
out O
here O
there O
still O
is O
some O
life O
going O
on O

and O
just O
sort O
of O
cheers O
me O
up O
to O
know O
that O

okay O

I O
can O
come O
back O
to O
it O
you O
know O

So O
that O
's O
that O
's O

yeah O

in O
that O
moment O
I O
mean O
nobody O
is O
going O
to O
like O

with O
that O
at O

There O
you O
are O

And O
every O

a O
little O
bit O
worried O
a- O
at O
first O
you O
know O
that O
when O
you O
got O
back O
there O
because O
the O
th- O
the O
money O
would O
run O
out O
probably O
in O
April B-DATE
or O
so O

and O
you O
know O

yeah O

And O
I O
knew O
you O
know O
I O
knew O
I O
'd O
get O
a O
job O
right O
I O
I O
mean O
I O
knew O
I O
would O
get O
a O
job O

but O
a- O
and O
I O
after O
I O
just O
stopped O
thinking O
about O
it O
I O
just O
started O
th- O
thought O
well O
fuck O
it O

I O
am O
going O

it O
's O
like O
inevitable O

and O
I O
'm O
I O
'm O

some- O
I O
want O
something O

I O
have O
to O
get O
something O

and O
I O
will O

uh-huh O

%um O
%huh O

But O
I O
did O
n't O
say O
I O
I O
just O
thought O
that O
you O
know O
I O
'll O
get O
a O
job O

and O
at O
this O
point O
if O
I O
get O
desperate O
I O
'll O
just O
have O
to O
take O
anything O

yeah O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
like O
kind O
of O
fell O
into O
something O
that O
's O
Fairly O
sweet O

I O
mean O
%eh O
in O
the O
beginning O
everything O
kind O
of O
starts O
out O
nice O

but O
I O
'm O
changing O
my O
attitude O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
get O
stressed O
out O
about O
it O
too O
much O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
try O
to O
change O
anything O

Good O

good O
time O
uh-huh O
. O
you O
know O

i- O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
not O
the O
same O

I O
'm O
either O

like O

Admiral O
John B-PERSON

said O
that O
the O

investigating O
the O

. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
whether O
it O
was O
terrorism O
or O
not O
. O

It O
was O
an O
act O
of O
certainly O
a O
severe O
belligerence O
but O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
the O
source O
, O
nor O
can O
I O
comment O
any O
further O
on O
that O
. O

But O
in O
Washington B-GPE
, O
Pentagon B-ORG
officials O
went O
further O
saying O
that O
they O
had O
every O
reason O
to O
suspect O
that O
the O
blast O
was O
caused O
by O
terrorists O
. O

The O
officials O
said O
that O
reports O
from O
the O
scene O
, O
including O
one B-CARDINAL
from O
an O
Army B-ORG
officer O
working O
in O
Aden B-FAC

, O
suggested O
that O
a O
small O
rubber O
craft O
that O
was O
helping O
the O
Cole B-PRODUCT
dock O
came O
alongside O
the O
destroyer O
and O
caused O
the O
blast O
. O

Many O
, O
including O
retired O
Admiral O
Eugene B-PERSON
Carroll I-PERSON
, O
are O
suspicious O
that O
the O
small O
boat O
may O
have O
been O
loaded O
with O
high O
- O
power O
explosives O
and O
that O
the O
attack O
was O
planned O
. O

That O
craft O
that O
approached O
the O
Cole B-PRODUCT
is O
a O
rubber O
boat O
, O
not O
a O
big O
craft O
, O
but O
they O
would O
have O
had O
to O
pack O
it O
fully O
with O
explosives O
to O
do O
the O
amount O
of O
damage O
that O
they O
did O
to O
the O

that O

that O

Yemen B-GPE

the O

, O
Secretary O

Madeleine O
Albright O
urged O
caution O
saying O
it O
was O
too O
early O
to O
jump O
to O
any O
conclusions O
. O

Still O
, O
she O
promised O
that O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
would O
take O
appropriate O
action O
if O
terrorists O
were O
found O
to O
be O
behind O
the O
blast O
, O
a O
sentiment O
echoed O
later B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME

by O
President O

. O

If O
, O
as O
it O
now O
appears O
, O
this O
was O
an O

, O
it O
was O
a O

We O

One O

to O
recall O
the O
bombing O
of O
the O
US B-NORP
Marine I-NORP
barracks O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
in O
1983 B-DATE
, O
also O
a B-DATE
month I-DATE

also O
at O
a O
time O
when O
Israel B-GPE
was O
involving O
suitable O
ferment O
at O
that O
point O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
now O
with O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP

where O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

was O
also O
attempting O
actively O
to O
provide O
some O
stabilizing O
influence O
and O
unfortunately O
and O
tragically O
got O
caught O
up O
in O
the O
maelstrom O
and O
that O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
salient O
fact O
of O
this O
attack O

And O
if O
this O
attack O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
the O
work O
of O

, O
Hoffman B-PERSON
says O
it O
would O
signal O
a O
dangerous O

Maritime O

are O
actually O
quite O

That O

it O
could O

We O

I O

attacking O
their O

using O
their O
more O
conventional O

` O

Previously O
an O

about O
the O
conduct O
of O

was O
published O
in O
this O
forum O
. O

The O
posting O
of O
the O
article O
revealed O
other O
aspects O
. O

He O
published O
copies O
of O
legal O
documents O
because O
he O
wanted O
to O
use O
them O
to O
prove O
that O
the O
issue O
was O
not O
based O
on O
inequality O
in O
lineage O
, O
but O
that O
it O
was O
related O
to O
behavioral O
aspects O
of O
the O
man O
, O

foremost O
among O
them O
is O
desertion O
and O
abandonment O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Now O
the O
newspapers O
, O
which O
I O
do O
not O
trust O
, O
still O
declare O
that O
inequality O
in O
lineage O
is O
the O
reason O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
is O
circulating O
among O
people O
about O
this O
issue O
, O
because O
accepting O
the O
notion O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
separating O
a O
wife O
from O
her O
husband O
by O
a O
decision O
outside O
the O
relationship O
-LRB- O
or O
even O
inside O
it O
-RRB- O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
disparity O
in O
the O
relative O
streams O
is O
a O
matter O
that O
robs O
the O
society O
of O
sleep O
and O
causes O
an O
exploding O
moral O
and O
social O
crisis O
which O
will O
have O
no O
end O
. O

If O
what O
was O
previously O
published O
in O
the O
forum O
is O
true O
, O
that O
the O
man O
was O
separated O
from O
her O
for O
other O
reasons O
, O
that O
would O
be O
reassuring O
. O

ِAnyway O
, O
transforming O
tradition O
and O
calling O
ignorance O
a O
legitimate O
basis O
for O
a O
verdict O
in O
a O
certain O
case O
is O
a O
matter O
which O
can O
not O
be O
accepted O
, O
believed O
, O
or O
trusted O
to O
be O
connected O
with O
Sharia B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Sharia B-WORK_OF_ART
is O
unequivocal O
and O
straightforward O
. O

No O
one O
was O
forced O
to O
accept O
and O
consent O
to O
any O
marriage O
. O

The O
glorious O
legislator O
would O
not O
have O
placed O
the O
decision O
of O
matrimony O
in O
the O
hand O
of O
the O
guardian O
and O
put O
conditions O
on O
it O
, O
and O
facilitate O
a O
legitimate O
alternative O
for O
him O
in O
case O
of O
his O
absence O
, O
unless O
the O
decision O
was O
final O
. O

Then O
would O
someone O
come O
afterwards O
to O
annul O
this O
and O
lean O
on O
the O
-LRB- O
Revelation B-WORK_OF_ART
-RRB- O
in O
such O
a O
thing O
??? O

As O
I O
said O
: O
if O
it O
was O
true O
that O
equality O
in O
lineage O
was O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
separation O
then O
may O

that O

But O
there O

It O

If O
the O

who O
undertook O
the O

his O

But O
as O
usual O
they O
do O
not O
know O

Rather O
it O
is O
incredibility O

the O

issue O
by O
asking O
the O
groom O
about O
his O
lineage O
before O
finalizing O
the O
contract O
. O

He O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
so O
as O
long O
as O
this O
issue O
has O
such O
a O
level O
of O
consideration O

It O
can O
threaten O
the O
family O
life O
of O
the O
bride O
and O
groom O
at O
any O
future O
moment O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
educational O
and O
religious O
institutions O
in O
the O
country O
are O
obliged O
socially O
to O
educate O
the O
society O
in O
a O
more O
profound O
way O
. O

There O
is O
no O
stronger O
evidence O
of O
the O
ignorance O
by O
a O
large O
sector O
of O
the O
possibility O
of O
separation O
because O
of O
inequality O
in O
lineage O
than O
the O
social O
debate O
stirred O
up O
by O
this O
issue O
, O
which O
was O
not O
limited O
to O
the O
common O
people O
but O
extended O
to O
writers O
, O
cultured O
people O
, O
and O
lawyers O
, O
foremost O
among O
them O
the O
defense O
lawyer O
who O
issued O
a O
statement O
after O
the O
verdict O
was O
issued O
by O
the B-ORG

of I-ORG
Appeals I-ORG
expressing O
that O
he O
would O
continue O
to O
stick O
to O
his O
position O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
verdict O
that O
was O
issued O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
also O
the O
duty O
of O
our O
media O
institutions O
which O
presented O
this O
case O
to O
the O
public O
opinion O
by O
following O
the O
verdict O
issued O
by O

with O
intensive O
interviews O
with O
a O
number O
of O
jurists O
and O

concerning O
this O

. O

This O

revealed O
that O
there O
are O
many O
things O
that O
we O
lack O
knowledge O
about O

Assuming O
that O
the O
couple O
's O
order O
of O
separation O
is O
traced O
to O
what O
are O
referred O
to O
as O
" O
behavioral O
aspects O
" O
such O
as O
the O
desertion O
of O
the O
husband O
and O
a O
long O
- O
term O
conditional O
divorce O
, O
what O
should O
the O
wife O
do O
, O
I O
wonder O
. O

Hold O
on O
to O
her O
husband O
and O
prefer O
prison O
to O
going O
with O
her O
mother O
and O

? O

Then O
... O
is O
the O
court O
entitled O
to O
interfere O
between O
a O
husband O
and O
his O
wife O
for O
flimsy O
" O
behavioral O
" O
reasons O
which O
the O

accepts O
? O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
supposition O
to O
which O
you O
referred O
in O
your O
participation O
is O
illogical O
. O

And O
what O
is O
" O
behind O
the O
hill O
" O
is O
the O
issue O
of O
" O
equality O
in O
lineage O
, O
" O
nothing O
else O
... O

I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
there O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
Muslim B-NORP
who O
accepts O
the O
verdict O
of O
the B-ORG

because O
it O
is O
a O
racist O
verdict O
and O
blatant O
interference O
between O
a O

his O

for O
trivial O
reasons O
. O

It O
is O
really O
shameful O
that O
the O
judiciary O

our O

works O
to O
entrench O

in O
the O

The O
Islamic B-NORP
religion O
is O
innocent O
of O
this O

as O
we O

It O
is O
also O
shameful O
that O
the O

alone O
in O

The O
former O
wife O
is O
not O
a O
trusted O
source O
of O
information O
for O
a O
very O
simple O
reason O
, O
namely O
that O
she O
most O
likely O
still O
bears O
some O
grudge O
against O
her O
former O
husband O
and O
against O
the O
woman O
who O
" O
stole O
" O
that O
husband O
from O
her O
. O

Really O
, O
what O
would O
urge O
this O
woman O
to O
say O
what O
she O
said O
about O
her O
former O
husband O
in O
a O
program O
watched O
by O
everyone O
? O

Does O
her O
conduct O
have O
any O
connection O
with O
noble O
morality O
? O

The O
ones O
who O
defamed O
the O

, O
my O

are O
undoubtedly O

This O

A O

The O

As O
we O
understand O
it O
, O
the O
man O
had O
the O

It O
was O
inside O

the O
city O

Police O
surrounded O
this O

The O

came O

did O
the O

Just O
as O
he O
did O
that O

that O

when O
you O

the O

They O

they O

That O
was O
after O

that O

the O

In O

concluded O

whether O

that O

A O

so I-CARDINAL
Democratic B-NORP
senators O
has O
been O
working O

The O
plan O
was O

, O

Wednesday B-DATE

again O

Sen. O
Mitchell B-PERSON
urged O
them O
to O
desist O
. O

Afterward O
, O
leaders O
of O
the O
dissident O
Democrats B-NORP
relented O
, O
and O
said O
they O
would O
n't O
offer O
their O
own O

as O
they O

The O
decision O
is O
a O

President O

who O

only O

, O
predicted O
that O
the O
tax O

be O
enacted O
this B-DATE

. O

He O
said O
a O
clear O
majority O
of O
senators O
back O
the O
tax O
reduction O
and O
that O
ultimately O
there O
would O
be O
enough O
senators O
to O
overcome O
any O
procedural O
hurdle O
the O
Democratic B-NORP
leadership O
might O
erect O
. O

But O
Sen. O
Mitchell B-PERSON
, O
buoyed O
by O
his O
victory O
among O
fellow O
Democrats B-NORP
, O
strongly O
disagreed O
. O

Mr. O
Mitchell B-PERSON
has O
been O
predicting O
that O
the O
president O

initiative O
would O
fail O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Yesterday B-DATE
, O
in O
an O
interview O
, O
he O
added O
that O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
' O
decision O
`` O
increases O
the O
likelihood O
that O
a O
capital O

gains O
tax O
cut O
will O
not O
pass O
this B-DATE

. O
'' O

Mr. O
Mitchell B-PERSON
's O
first O
victory O
came O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
when O
the O
Senate B-ORG
passed O
a O
deficit O
- O
reduction O
bill O
that O
did O
n't O
contain O
a O
capital O
- O
gains O
provision O
. O

That O
vote O
made O
it O
unlikely O
that O
a O
capital O
- O
gains O
tax O
cut O
would O
be O
included O
in O
the O
final O
bill O
, O
now O
being O
drafted O
by O
House B-ORG
and O
Senate B-ORG
negotiators O
. O

The O
House B-ORG
version O
of O
the O
bill O
does O
include O
the O
tax O
cut O
. O

Now O
Republican B-NORP
leaders O
are O
concentrating O
on O
attaching O
a O
capital O
- O
gains O
amendment O
to O
some O
other O
bill O
, O
perhaps O
a O
measure O
raising O
the O
federal O
borrowing O
limit O
or O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
tax O
bill O
that O
would O
follow O
on O
the O
heels O
of O
the O

legislation O

To O
help O
lay O
the O
groundwork O
for O
that O

, O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
plans O
early B-DATE
next I-DATE
week I-DATE
to O
meet O
at O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG

some O
20 B-CARDINAL
Democratic B-NORP
senators O
who O
favor O
cutting O
the O
capital O

are O
undecided O
on O
the O
issue O

at O

some O

it O

`` O
I O

a O

those O

The O
Packwood B-PERSON
plan O
, O
as O
expected O
, O
would O
allow O

to O
exclude O

5 B-PERCENT

the O

from O
the O
sale O
of O
a O
capital O
asset O

for O
more B-DATE

one I-DATE

The O
exclusion O
would O
rise O
five B-CARDINAL

points O
for O
each B-DATE

the O
asset O
was O
held O
, O
until O
it O
reached O
a O
maximum O
of O
35 B-PERCENT

seven B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

The O
exclusion O
would O
apply O
to O
assets O
sold O
after O
Oct. B-DATE
1 I-DATE
. O

As O
an O
alternative O
, O
taxpayers O
could O
chose O
to O
reduce O
their O
gains O
by O
an O
inflation O
index O
. O

For O
corporations O
, O
the O
top O
tax O
rate O
on O
the O
sale O
of O
assets O
held O
for O
more B-DATE

three I-DATE

would O
be O
cut O
to O
33 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
from O
the O
current O
top O
rate O
of O
34 B-PERCENT

That O

The O

Without O

the O

Some O

A O
glance O

the O

people O
with O
a O
little O
political O
sensitivity O
may O
roughly O
understand O
the O
core O
topic O
of O
this O
article O
: O
the O
rule O
of O
benign O
interaction O
between O
planned O
economy O
and O
market O
economy O
, O
and O
between O
public O
ownership O
and O
private O
ownership O
-- O
because O
only O
their O
relationships O
are O
those O
between O
a O
father O
and O
a O
son O
, O
and O
it O
is O
only O
between O
them O
are O
there O
different O
conflicts O

human O
relations O

" O
" O
rules O
" O
and O

science O

as O

bloody O
wrestling O
between O
classes O
, O
factions O
and O
individuals O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
morality O
and O
interests O
. O

Comparing O
planned O
economy O
and O
public O
ownership O
to O
a O
father O
is O
tantamount O
to O
comparing O
market O
economy O
and O
private O
ownership O
to O
a O
son O
, O
which O
holds O
water O
principally O
and O
historically O
no O

you O
put O
it O
this O
way O
or O
another O

This O
is O
because O
the O
former O
two B-CARDINAL

are O
indeed O
the O
most O
essential O

the O
socialist B-NORP
new O
China B-GPE
, O
while O
the O
latter O
two O
dubbed O
" O
son O
" O
in O
this O
article O
-- O
are O
indeed O
the O
ideological O
outcomes O
derived O
after O
the O
death O
of O
China B-GPE
's O
founder O
Comrade O
Mao B-PERSON
Zedong I-PERSON
under O
tremendous O
international O
and O
domestic O
political O
pressures O
on O
planned O
economy O
and O
public O
ownership O
, O
which O
grew O
into O
today B-DATE
's O
para-system O
after O
about O
30 B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
reform O
and O
opening O
up O
. O

Regarding O
this O
, O
the O
factual O
development O
process O
of O
political O
civilization O
that O
the O
Marxist B-NORP
ideology O
has O
been O
increasingly O
marginalized O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
or O
so O
is O
a O
strong O
evidence O
. O

By O
sorting O
out O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
above O
historical O
background O
and O
conceptual O
relationships O
, O
we O
will O
have O
a O
pretty O
thorough O
, O
comprehensive O
and O
systematic O
knowledge O
framework O
about O
the O
benign O
inevitable O
trends O
and O
development O
guidelines O
of O
the O
future O
society O
dependent O
on O
the O
rule O
of O
society O
, O
so O
that O
the O
associated O
impression O
captured O
may O
be O
more O
concrete O
. O

Regarding O
this O
, O
my O
standpoint O
is O
: O
because O
the O
socialism O
underpinned O
by O
planned O
economy O
, O
public O
ownership O
and O
the O
people O
's O
democratic O
dictatorship O
is O
indeed O
a O
really O
" O
fresh O
" O
systemic O
thing O
for O
China B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
mid I-DATE
and I-DATE
late I-DATE
20th I-DATE
century I-DATE
-- O
without O
a O
model O
or O
sufficient O
experience O
or O
theories O
to O
refer O
to O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
scientific O
its O
kernel O
is O
, O
it O
is O
hard O
not O
to O
have O
certain O
superficial O
and O
local O
problems O
. O

However O
, O
this O
should O
not O
provide O
an O
excuse O
to O
overthrow O
it O
by O
fair O
means O
or O
foul O
, O
as O
he O
is O
our O
father O
and O
the O
common O
choice O
of O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
laboring O
people O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
it O
" O
finally O
became O
our O
national O
character O
and O
main O
system O
after O
over O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
century I-DATE
of O
international O
and O
domestic O
political O
transformation O
" O
is O
a O
stronger O
proof O
that O
it O
is O
the O
milestone O
for O
a O
new O
civilization O
resulted O
from O
the O
blood O
and O
sweat O
of O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
proletarian O
revolutionary O
martyrs O
. O

Therefore O
, O
no O
matter O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
average O
citizens O
or O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
the O
founder O
of O
the O
new O
government O
, O
we O
should O
respect O
and O
develop O
her O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
inheritance O
, O
innovation O
and O
improvement O
. O

Is O
my O
opinion O
above O
correct O
? O

I O
believe O
you O
will O
naturally O
obtain O
a O
relatively O
fair O
and O
just O
conclusion O
if O
you O
could O
understand O
and O
treat O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
" O
father O
" O
system O
and O
" O
son O
" O
system O
with O
impartiality O
and O
sufficient O
goodwill O
. O

For O
example O
, O
based O
on O
the O
existing O
institutional O
cultural O
heritage O
in O
the O
human O
history O
, O
we O
could O
see O
: O
the O
" O
father O
" O
system O
mentioned O
herein O
has O
the O
majority O
in O
mind O
or O
it O
is O
established O
in O
the O
fundamental O
and O
long O
- O
term O
interests O
of O
the O
majority O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
need O
for O
sustainable O
and O
sound O
development O
of O
the O
country O
, O
the O
nation O
, O
and O
the O
overall O
society O
-- O
while O
the O
" O
son O
" O
system O
mentioned O
herein O
is O
ignorant O
and O
sick O
in O
the O
company O
of O
such O
behavioral O
characteristics O
as O
exploitation O
, O
fraudulence O
, O
pernicious O
influence O
and O
robbery O
. O

So O
, O
we O
can O
not O
urge O
the O
son O
to O
throttle O
the O
essentially O
healthy O
and O
scientific O
" O
father O
" O
system O
by O
fair O
mean O
or O
foul O
without O
considering O
the O
consequences O
, O
because O
there O
are O
problems O
in O
its O
practice O
and O
development O
-- O
such O
as O
state O
monopoly O
for O
purchases O
and O
sales O
, O
lower O
efficiency O
due O
to O
centralized O
management O
, O
and O
inhibition O
of O
the O
will O
of O
productivity O
by O
undue O
political O
pressure O
resulting O
from O
class O
struggles O
during O
the O
new O
deal O
. O

It O
is O
because O
that O
will O
not O
only O
make O
the O
society O
increasingly O
ignorant O
and O
sick O
as O
it O
violates O
the O
rule O
of O
benign O
social O
development O
, O
distorts O
normal O
" O
human O
relations O
" O
and O
the O
ethic O
and O
prevalent O
value O
and O
the O
rule O
of O
civilization O
update O
rooted O
in O
it O
, O
but O
the O
humanity O
will O
retrogress O
as O
people O
's O
thoughts O
and O
behaviors O
become O
increasingly O
ridiculous O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
the O
case O
. O

My O
opinion O
above O
is O
not O
absurd O
and O
delusive O
at O
all O
, O
because O
this O
is O
true O
not O
only O
in O
theory O
, O
but O
also O
to O
the O
rule O
of O
social O
development O
as O
demonstrated O
by O

as O
well O
as O
from O
the O

" O

All O

are O
directed O
at O
the O

symptoms O
such O
as O

for O

how O
empty O
, O

. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
want O
to O
say O
to O
the O
world O
and O
the O
age O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
article O
: O
when O
the O

, O
we O
should O
try O
our O

to O
treat O

, O

open O
up O
a O

, O
obeying O

, O

and O
carrying O
on O
the O
legacy O
-- O
if O
the O
present O
capitalist O
followers O
frantically O
urge O
the O
son O
to O
kill O
him O
by O
all O
means O
, O
the O
result O
could O
only O
be O
a O
tragedy O
! O

And O
these O
happen O
to O
be O
the O
core O
of O
the O
destiny O
where O
the O
capitalist O
roaders O
" O
will O
inevitably O
bury O
themselves O
due O
to O
their O
ignorance O
and O
insanity O
, O
and O
more O
or O
less O
harm O
the O
human O
society O
! O
" O

At O
last O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
admonish O
sincerely O
and O
earnestly O
those O
who O
blindly O
oppose O
, O
hate O
and O
even O
suppress O
planned O
economy O
, O
public O

of O
the O

especially O
the O

who O
insist O

your O

The O
result O
is O
definitely O
a O
tragedy O

because O
even O
if O
you O

the O

since O
November B-DATE

According O
to O
Li B-PERSON
, O
the O
newsletter O
is O
extremely O
important O
to O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
area O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
reasons O
. O

Firstly B-ORDINAL
, O
it O
enables O
people O
to O
share O
information O
. O

People O
can O
see O
that O
they O
are O
not O
alone O
in O
their O
suffering O
, O
and O
that O
they O
must O
address O
their O
situation O
from O
a O
collective O
standpoint O
instead O
of O
chasing O
after O
individual O
problems O
one B-CARDINAL
at O
a O
time O
. O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
area O
need O
information O
from O
the O
outside O
world O
, O
and O
now O
that O
the O
news O
media O
have O
shifted O
their O
attention O
to O
other O
matters O
, O
the O
local O
people O
need O
an O
avenue O
by O
which O
to O
get O
their O
message O
out O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

The O
newsletter O
is O
just O
the O
thing O
to O
accomplish O
these O
objectives O
. O

This O
newsletter O
has O
also O
helped O
to O
spur O
increased O
contact O
between O
the O
people O
of O
Peipu B-GPE
and O
Shihkang B-GPE
. O

According O
to O
Li B-PERSON
Chieh I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
ying I-PERSON
, O
they O
distribute O
3,000 B-CARDINAL
copies O
of O
the B-ORG
Shihkang I-ORG
Newsletter I-ORG
in O
Shihkang B-GPE
, O
500 B-CARDINAL
in O
Tungshih B-GPE
and O
Shinshe B-GPE
, O
and O
1,000 B-CARDINAL
in O
Peipu B-GPE
, O
which O
enables O
the O
people O
of O
Peipu B-GPE
to O
truly O
get O
a O
feel O
for O
what O
is O
needed O
in O
the O
disaster O
area O
. O

By O
sending O
a O
person O
to O
serve O
full O
- O
time O
at O
the B-ORG
Shihkang I-ORG
Work I-ORG
Station I-ORG
, O
TCAC B-ORG
has O
managed O
to O
quickly O
integrate O
itself O
into O
the O
local O
community O
in O
Shihkang B-GPE
, O
and O
to O
see O
where O
assistance O
is O
most O
urgently O
needed O
. O

The O
children O
of O
Shihkang B-GPE
, O
for O
example O
, O
are O
in O
especially O
great O
need O
of O
psychological O
counseling O
, O
so O
TCAC B-ORG
asked O
the B-ORG
Hsiuh I-ORG
- I-ORG
li I-ORG
Liuh I-ORG
Memorial I-ORG
Foundation I-ORG
to O
provide O
therapy O
for O
children O
and O
teachers O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the B-ORG
Shihkang I-ORG
Work I-ORG
Station I-ORG
is O
also O
helping O
to O
build O
prefab O
shelters O
. O

The B-ORG
Far I-ORG
Eastern I-ORG
group I-ORG
only O
donated O
50 B-CARDINAL
prefab O
units O
, O
and O
people O
in O
less O
than O
privileged O
situations O
-LRB- O
such O
as O
renters O
and O
those O
living O
in O
illegally O
constructed O
residences O
-RRB- O
were O
not O
even O
eligible O
to O
apply O
for O
them O
, O
so O
TCAC B-ORG
has O
been O
working O
hard O
to O
put O
up O
prefab O
units O
for O
the O
residents O
of O
Tzu B-FAC

yun I-FAC
Lane I-FAC
. O

Several O
old O
residences O
collapsed O
there O
, O
causing O
numerous O
deaths O
and O
injuries O
. O

The O
work O
on O
the O
prefab O
units O
has O
been O
a O
race O
against O
time O
, O
for O
as O
Shu B-PERSON

points O
out O
, O
some O
people O
in O
the O
disaster O
area O
have O
died O
of O
cold O
over O
the O
winter O
. O

To O
survive O
the O
great O
earthquake O
only O
to O
die O
because O
of O
an O
inadequate O
relief O

seems O
the O
height O

main O
project O
was O
the O
publication O

The B-ORG

provided O

" O
I O
used O
to O

a O

in O
another O

every O
time O
I O
came O
back O
to O

I O
would O
go O
straight O
to O
the O

wolf O
down O
a O

even O
before O

keeping O
the O

for O
two B-DATE

has O
been O
no O
small O
accomplishment O

" O
These O

do O

write O

A O

might O
spend O
four B-TIME

" O

In O

goes O
on O

" O
says O
Shu B-PERSON

adding O
that O
when O
help O
is O
needed O
the O
locals O
are O
likely O
to O
contribute O
not O
just O
money O
but O
something O
even O
more O
valuable O
- O
their O
time O
and O
energy O
. O

When O
TCAC B-ORG
puts O
on O
an O
activity O
, O
for O
example O
, O
if O
someone O
notices O
that O
an O
event O
organizer O
is O
getting O
thirsty O
they O
will O
immediately O
bring O
him O
a O
bottle O
of O
mineral O
water O
. O

When O
a O
musical O
performance O
is O
scheduled O
, O
someone O
will O
always O
take O
it O
upon O
themselves O
to O
set O
out O
seats O
for O
the O
audience O
. O

" O
If O
the O
local O
residents O
agree O
with O
what O
you O
're O
doing O
, O
they O
're O
sure O
to O
pitch O
in O
and O
help O
, O
" O
says O
Shu B-PERSON
, O
who O
considers O
this O
spirit O
of O
volunteerism O
much O
more O
valuable O
than O
monetary O
donations O
. O

That O
is O
why O
TCAC B-ORG
has O
been O
able O
to O
carry O
out O
so O
many O
activities O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
three I-DATE

without O
spending O
any O

post-harvest O

of O

have O
begun O
to O
sense O
the O
value O
of O
what O
they O
've O
got O
in O
their O
community O
. O

The O
campaign O
to O
beautify O
Peipu B-GPE

Hsia B-FAC

is O
an O
excellent O
case O
in O
point O
. O

Seven B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
in O
order O
to O
ease O
the O
problem O
of O
increasing O
traffic O
congestion O
, O
the O
township O
widened O
Hsia B-FAC
Street I-FAC
. O

The O
project O
required O
demolition O
of O
all O
the O
covered O
walkways O
that O
used O
to O
stand O
outside O
the O
stores O
there O
. O

It O
seemed O
like O
a O
laudable O
move O
toward O
modernization O
at O
the O
time O
, O
but O
people O
living O
along O
the O
street O
came O
to O
rue O
the O
loss O
of O
their O
covered O
walkways O
. O

Cars O
came O
roaring O
down O
in O
great O
numbers O
along O
the O
widened O
street O
, O
while O
the O
residents O
lost O
the O
space O
in O
front O
of O
their O
homes O
where O
they O
had O
once O
enjoyed O
many O
a O
leisurely O
hour O

According O
to O
Chiang B-PERSON
Yi I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
sen I-PERSON
, O
whose O
store O
is O
located O
on O
Hsia B-FAC
Street I-FAC
, O
everybody O
used O
to O
congregate O
in O
the O
cool O
shade O
of O
the O
walkways O
in O
the O
summer O
. O

Neighbors O
were O
more O
involved O
with O
each O
other O
, O
and O
his O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
always O
had O
a O
place O
to O
play O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
covered O
walkways O
have O
been O
replaced O
by O
parking O
spaces O
, O
people O
scarcely O
leave O
their O
homes O
. O

The O
old O
folks O
stay O
inside O
watching O
television O
, O
while O
the O
young O
people O
only O
emerge O
briefly O
on O
their O
way O
to O
work O
. O

People O
rarely O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
speak O
to O
each O
other O
anymore O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
the O
people O
of O
Peipu B-GPE
quickly O
realized O
their O
mistake O
. O

Last B-DATE

for O
authorization O
to O

a O
campaign O

The O

did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
restore O
something O
of O
their O
former O

. O

They O
erected O
street O

put O
out O

could O
sit O

have O
succeeded O

creating O
a O
very O

The O
gaily O

seems O
almost O
to O

It O
might O
be O
impossible O
for O
Hsia B-FAC

to O
ever O
be O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
it O
once O
was O

but O
the O
beautification O
campaign O
taught O
the O
people O
of O
Peipu B-GPE
the O
value O
of O
what O
they O
have O
. O

When O

replace O
them O

asking O

but O
at O

it O

At O

it O
has O
a O
little O

. O

Most O
of O

have O
to O
spend O
our O
time O
on O
pursuits O
that O
afford O
neither O

But O
sooner O
or O

, O
most O
of O

have O
to O
think O
about O

just O
as O

would O
do O
but O
having O
no O
idea O
of O
what O
kind O
of O

I O
wanted O
, O
I O
looked O
at O
the O
myriad O
products O
of O
a O
dozen B-CARDINAL
companies O
-- O
and O
plunged O
into O
a O
jungle O
of O
gibberish O
. O

Over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
decade I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
, O
while O
I O
was O
thinking O
about O
fox O
hunting O
, O
the O
insurance O
industry O
has O
spawned O
an O
incredible O
number O
of O
products O
, O
variations O
on O
products O
, O
and O
variations O
on O
the O
variations O
. O

Besides O
term O
life O
and O
whole O

-LRB- O
the O
old O

-RRB- O
, O
we O
now O
have O
universal O
life O
, O
universal O
variable O
life O
, O
flexible O
adjustable O
universal O
life O
, O
policies O
with O
persistency O
bonuses O
, O
policies O
festooned O
with O
exotic O
riders O
, O
living O
benefit O
policies O
, O
and O
on O
and O
on O
. O

What O
to O
do O
? O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
generalize O
. O

Shorn O
of O
all O
their O
riders O
, O
special O
provisions O
, O
and O
other O
bells O
and O
whistles O
, O
insurance O
policies O
can O
still O
be O
grouped O
under O
two B-CARDINAL
broad O
categories O
: O
so O
- O
called O
pure O
insurance O
, O
which O
amasses O
no O
cash O
value O
in O
the O
policy O
and O
pays O
off O
only O
upon O
death O
, O
and O
permanent O
insurance O
, O
which O
provides O
not O
only O
a O
death O
benefit O
but O
also O
a O
cash O
value O
in O
the O
policy O
that O
can O
be O
used O
in O
various O
ways O
while O
the O
insured O
is O
still O
alive O
. O

If O
all O
you O
want O
is O
death O
- O
benefit O
coverage O
, O
pure O
insurance O
-- O
a O
term O
policy O
-- O
gives O
you O
maximum O
bang O
for O
your O
buck O
, O
within O
limits O
. O

It O
's O
much O
cheaper O
than O
permanent O
insurance O
bought O
at O
the O
same O
age O
. O

But O
`` O
term O
'' O
means O
just O
that O
; O
the O
policy O
is O
written O
for O
a O
specific O
time O
period O
only O
and O
must O
be O
renewed O
when O
it O
expires O
. O

It O
may O
also O
stipulate O
that O
the O
insured O
must O
pass O
another O
medical O
exam O
before O
renewal O
; O
if O
you O
flunk O
-- O
which O
means O
you O
need O
insurance O
more O
than O
ever O
-- O
you O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
're O
healthy O
and O
can O
renew O
, O
your O
premium O
will O
go O
up O
sharply O
because O
you O
're O
that O
much O
older O
. O

So O
term O
insurance O
may O
not O
be O
as O
cheap O
as O
it O
looks O
. O

There O
are O
all O
sorts O
of O
variations O
on O
term O
insurance O
: O
policies O
structured O
to O
pay O
off O
your O
mortgage O
debt O
, O
term O
riders O
tacked O
on O
to O
permanent O
insurance O
, O
and O
many O
others O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
variation O
that O
appealed O
to O
me O
at O
first B-ORDINAL
was O
the O
`` O
Money O
Smart O
Term O
Life O
'' O
policy O
offered O
by O
Amex B-ORG
Life I-ORG
Insurance I-ORG
Co. I-ORG
, O
the O
American B-ORG
Express I-ORG
unit O
, O
to O
the O
parent O
company O
's O
credit O
- O
card O
holders O
. O

Upon O
examination O
, O
however O
, O
I O
wondered O
whether O
the O
plan O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
. O

Amex B-ORG
said O
it O
would O
charge O
me O
$ O
576 B-MONEY
a O
year O
for O
$ O
100,000 B-MONEY
of O
coverage O
-- O
and O
would O
pay O
me O
back O
all O
the O
premiums O
I O
put O
in O
if O
I O
canceled O
the O
policy O
after O
10 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Sounds O
great O
-- O
or O
does O
it O
? O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
if O
I O
canceled O
, O
I O
'd O
have O
no O
more O
insurance O
, O
a O
not O
insignificant O
consideration O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
$ O
5,760 B-MONEY
I O
'd O
get O
back O
would O
be O
much O
diminished O
in O
purchasing O
power O
by O
10 B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O
inflation O
; O
Amex B-ORG
, O
not O
I O
, O
would O
get O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
investment O
income O
on O
my O
money O
, O
income O
that O
would O
have O
exceeded O
the O
inflation O
rate O
and O
thus O
given O
the O
company O
a O
real O
profit O
. O

Third B-ORDINAL
and O
most O
important O
, O
Amex O
would O
charge O
me O
a O
far O
higher O
premium O
than O
other O
reputable O
companies O
would O
on O
a O
straight O
term O
policy O
for O
the O
same O
amount O
; O
I O
'd O
be O
paying O
so O
heavily O
just O
to O
have O
the O
option O
of O
getting O
my O
premiums O
back O
that O
I O
'd O
almost O
have O
to O
cancel O
to O
make O
the O
whole O
thing O
worthwhile O
. O

That O
would O
be O
all O
right O
with O
Amex B-ORG
, O
which O
could O
then O
lock O
in O
its O
investment O
profit O
, O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
add O
up O
to O
a O
`` O
smart O
money O
'' O
move O
for O
me O
. O

Which O
goes O
to O
show O
that O
the O
First B-ORDINAL
Law O
applies O
in O
insurance O
as O
in O
anything O
else O
: O
There O
is O
no O
free O
lunch O
, O
there O
is O
only O
marketing O
. O

And O
the O
Second B-ORDINAL
Law O
, O
unique O
to O
insurance O
? O

If O
I O
die O
early O
, O
I O
win O
-- O
a O
hollow O
victory O
, O
since O
I O
ca O
n't O
enjoy O
it O
-- O
and O
if O
I O
live O
long O
, O
the O
insurer O
wins O
. O

Always O
. O

This O
is O
worth O
remembering O
when O
insurers O
and O
their O
salesmen O
try O
to O
sell O
you O
permanent O
insurance O
, O
the O
kind O
that O
amasses O
cash O
value O
. O

The O
word O
`` O
death O
'' O
can O
not O
be O
escaped O
entirely O
by O
the O
industry O
, O
but O
salesmen O
dodge O
it O
wherever O
possible O
or O
cloak O
it O
in O
euphemisms O
, O
preferring O
to O
talk O
about O
`` O
savings O
'' O
and O
`` O
investment O
'' O
instead O
. O

The O
implication O
is O
that O
your O
permanent O
- O
insurance O
policy O
is O
really O
some O
kind O
of O
CD O
or O
mutual O
- O
fund O
account O
with O
an O
added O
feature O
. O

That O
is O
gilding O
the O
lily O
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
as O
a O
savings O
or O
investment O
vehicle O
, O
insurance O
generally O
runs O
a O
poor O
second B-ORDINAL
to O
any O
direct O
investment O
you O
might O
make O
in O
the O
same O
things O
the O
insurance O
company O
is O
putting O
your O
money O
into O
. O

That O
's O
because O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
insurance O
portion O
of O
the O
policy O
and O
the O
effort O
required O
to O
sell O
and O
service O
the O
whole O
package O
. O

Again O
, O
no O
free O
lunch O
. O

This O
is O
reflected O
in O
a O
built O
- O
in O
mortality O
cost O
-- O
in O
effect O
, O
your O
share O
of O
the O
company O
's O
estimated O
liability O
in O
paying O
off O
beneficiaries O
of O
people O
who O
had O
the O
effrontery O
to O
die O
while O
under O
its O
protection O
. O

And O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
a O
huge O
hunk O
of O
your O
premium O
in O
the B-DATE
initial I-DATE
year I-DATE
or I-DATE
two I-DATE
of O
the O
the O
policy O
is O
, O
in O
effect O
, O
paying O
the O
salesman O
's O
commission O
as O
well O
; O
investment O
returns O
on O
most O
policies O
are O
actually O
negative O
for O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
largely O
because O
of O
this O
. O

So O
view O
permanent O
insurance O
for O
what O
it O
is O
-- O
a O
compromise O
between O
pure O
insurance O
and O
direct O
investment O
. O

The O
simplest O
, O
most O
traditional O
form O
of O
permanent O
insurance O
is O
the O
straight O
whole O
life O
policy O
. O

You O
pay O
a O
set O
premium O
for O
a O
set O
amount O
of O
coverage O
, O
the O
company O
invests O
that O
premium O
in O
a O
portfolio O
of O
its O
choosing O
, O
and O
your O
cash O
value O
and O
dividends O
grow O
over O
the B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

One B-CARDINAL
newer O
wrinkle O
, O
so O
called O
single O
- O
premium O
life O
-LRB- O
you O
pay O
for O
the O
whole O
policy O
at O
once O
-RRB- O
, O
has O
been O
immensely O
popular O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
for O
tax O
reasons O
; O
the O
insured O
could O
extract O
cash O
value O
in O
the O
form O
of O
policy O
`` O
loans O
, O
'' O
and O
none O
of O
the O
proceeds O
were O
taxable O
even O
though O
they O
included O
gains O
on O

Mass. B-GPE
, O
has O
developed O
a O
`` O
combination O
plan O
'' O
of O
annuity O
and O
insurance O
coverage O
that O
it O
says O
does O
not O
violate O
the O
new O
regulations O
and O
that O
allows O
policy O
loans O
without O
tax O
consequences O
. O

But O
the O
percentage O
of O
your O
cash O
reserve O
that O
you O
can O
borrow O
tax O
- O
free O
is O
very O
small O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
prepared O
in O
any O
case O
to O
put O
that O
much O
money O
into O
a O
policy O
immediately O
, O
so O
I O
look O
into O
the O
broad O
category O
called O
universal O
life O
. O

Hugely O
popular O
, O
it O
is O
far O
more O
flexible O
than O
straight O
whole O
life O
. O

I O
can O
adjust O
the O
amount O
of O
insurance O
I O
want O
against O
the O
amount O
going O
into O
investment O
; O
I O
can O
pay O
more O
or O
less O
than O
the O
so O
- O
called O
target O
premium O
in O
a B-DATE
given I-DATE
year I-DATE
; O
and O
I O
can O
even O
skip O
payments O
if O
my O
cash O
reserves O
are O
enough O
to O
cover O
the O
insurance O
portion O
of O
the O
policy O
. O

In O
looking O
at O
these O
and O
other O
policies O
, O
I O
learn O
to O
ask O
pointed O
questions O
about O
some O
of O
the O
assumptions O
built O
into O
`` O
policy O
illustrations O
'' O
-- O
the O
rows O
of O
numbers O
that O
show O
me O
the O
buildup O
of O
my O
cash O
values O
over O
the B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

They O
commonly O
give O
two B-CARDINAL
scenarios O
: O
One B-CARDINAL
is O
based O
on O
interest O
rates O
that O
the O
company O
guarantees O
-LRB- O
usually O
4 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
to I-PERCENT
4.5 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
-RRB- O
and O
the O
other O
on O
the O
rate O
it O
is O
currently O
getting O
on O
investment O
, O
often O
8.5 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
or O
more O
. O

Projecting O
the O
latter O
over O
several B-DATE
decades I-DATE
, O
I O
find O
my O
cash O
buildup O
is O
impressive O
-- O
but O
can O
any O
high O
interest O
rate O
prevail O
for O
that O
long O
? O

Not O
likely O
, O
I O
think O
. O

Also O
, O
some O
policy O
illustrations O
assume O
that O
mortality O
costs O
will O
decline O
or O
that O
I O
will O
get O
some O
sort O
of O
dividend O
bonus O
after O
the B-DATE
10th I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

These O
are O
not O
certain O
, O
either O
. O

Companies O
`` O
are O
n't O
comfortable O
playing O
these O
games O
, O
but O
they O
realize O
they O
're O
under O
pressure O
to O
make O
their O
policies O
look O
good O
, O
'' O
says O
Timothy B-PERSON
Pfiefer I-PERSON
, O
an O
actuarial O
consultant O
at O
Tillinghast B-ORG
, O
a O

, O
the O
big O
New B-GPE

consulting O

. O

Another O
factor O
to O
consider O
: O
Some O
of O
the O
companies O
currently O
earning O
very O
high O
yields O
are O
doing O
so O
through O
substantial O
investment O
in O
junk O
bonds O
, O
and O
you O
know O
how O
nervous O
the O
market O
has O
been O
about O
those O
lately O
. O

There O
are O
seemingly O
endless O
twists O
to O
universal O
life O
, O
and O
it O
pays O
to O
ask O
questions O
about O
all O
of O
them O
. O

At O
a O
back O
- O
yard O
barbecue O
, O
for O
example O
, O
a O
friend O
boasts O
that O
she O
'll O
only O
have O
to O
pay O
premiums O
on O
her O
John B-ORG
Hancock I-ORG
policy O
for O
seven B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
that O
her O
death O
benefits O
will O
then O
be O
`` O
guaranteed O
. O
'' O

I O
call O
her O
agent O
, O
David B-PERSON
Dominici I-PERSON
. O

Yes O
, O
he O
says O
, O
premiums O
on O
such O
variable O
- O
rate O
coverage O
can O
be O
structured O
to O
`` O
vanish O
'' O
after O
a O
certain O
period O
-- O
but O
usually O
only O
if O
interest O
rates O
stay O
high O
enough O
to O
generate O
sufficient O
cash O
to O
cover O
the O
annual B-DATE
cost O
of O
insurance O
protection O
. O

If O
interest O
rates O
plunge O
, O
the O
insurer O
may O
be O
knocking O
on O
my O
door O
, O
asking O
for O
steeper O
premium O
payments O
to O
maintain O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
protection O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O
sound O
of O
that O
. O

Some O
insurers O
have O
also O
started O
offering O
`` O
persistency O
bonuses O
, O
'' O
such O
as O
extra O
dividends O
or O
a O
marginally O
higher O
interest O
yield O
, O
if O
the O
policy O
is O
maintained O
for O
10 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

But O
Glenn B-PERSON
Daily I-PERSON
, O
a O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
- O
based O
financial O
consultant O
, O
warns O
that O
many O
of O
these O
bonuses O
are O
`` O
just O
fantasies O
, O
'' O
because O
most O
are O
n't O
guaranteed O
by O
the O
companies O
. O

And O
the O
feature O
is O
so O
new O
, O
he O
adds O
, O
that O
no O
insurer O
has O
yet O
established O
a O
track O
record O
for O
actually O
making O
such O
payments O
. O

So O
- O
called O
living O
- O
benefits O
provisions O
also O
merit O
a O
close O
inspection O
. O

insurers O

, O
these O
policy O
riders O
let O
me O
tap O
a O
portion O
of O
my O
death O
benefits O
while O
I O
'm O
still O
alive O
. O

Some O
provisions O
would O
let O
me O
collect O
a O
percentage O
of O
the O
policy O
's O
face O
value O
to O
pay O
for O
long O
- O
term O
care O
such O
as O
nursing O
- O
home O
stays O
; O
others O
would O
allow O
payments O
for O
catastrophic O
illnesses O
and O
conditions O
such O
as O
cancer O
, O
heart O
attarcks O
, O
renal O
failure O
and O
kidney O
transplants O
. O

But O
the O
catastrophic O
events O
for O
which O
the O
policyholder O
can O
collect O
are O
narrowly O
defined O
, O
vary O
from O
policy O
to O
policy O
, O
and O
generally O
permit O
use O
of O
only O
a O
small O
fraction O
of O
the O
face O
amount O
of O
insurance O
. O

Also O
, O
financial O
planners O
advising O
on O
insurance O
say O
that O
to O
their O
knowledge O
there O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
a O
tax O
ruling O
exempting O
these O
advance O
payments O
from O
taxes O
. O

And O
considering O
the O
extra O
cost O
of O
such O
provisions O
, O
some O
figure O
that O
people O
interested O
in O
, O
say O
, O
paying O
for O
extended O
nursing O
- O
home O
care O
would O
be O
better O
off O
just O
buying O
a O
separate O
policy O
that O
provides O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
more O
favorably O
impressed O
by O
`` O
no O
- O
load O
life O
, O
'' O
even O
though O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
low O
- O
load O
life O
. O

Insureres O
selling O
these O
policies O
market O
them O
directly O
to O
the O
public O
or O
otherwise O
do O
n't O
use O
commissioned O

; O
there O
is O
still O
a O
load O
-- O
annual B-DATE
administrative O
fees O
and O
initial O
`` O
setup O
'' O

-- O
but O
I O
figure O
that O
the O
lack O
of O
commission O
and O
of O
`` O
surrender O
fees O
'' O
for O
dropping O
the O
policy O
early O
still O
saves O
me O
a O
lot O
. O

I O

Mr. O
Azam B-PERSON
Al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Ahmed I-PERSON
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
international O
community O
is O
actually O
demanding O
Hamas B-ORG
to O
recognize O
Israel B-GPE
and O
reject O
violence O
, O
we O
hear O
some O
of O
your O
colleagues O
actually O
criticizing O
Hamas B-ORG
, O
that O
its O
members O
have O
not O
fired O
one O
shot O
at O
the O
Israelis B-NORP
since O
the O
truce O
agreement O
. O

How O
ah O
I O
mean O
, O
can O
we O
reconcile O
these O
two O
subjects O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
maybe O
some O
statements O
are O
released O
inaccurately O
but O
amid O
ah O
the O
skirmishes O
and O
harassment O
, O
some O
statements O
come O
out O
, O
I O
mean O
ah O
that O
the O
only O
aim O
behind O
them O
in O
my O
estimation O
is O
harassment O
, O
not O
more O
than O
that O
. O

We O
say O
yes O
, O
Hamas B-ORG
was O
the O
regiment O
most O
committed O
to O
the O
truce O
that O
was O
announced O
in O
Cairo B-GPE
, O
and O
this O
is O
not O
at O
all O
a O
fault O
, O
but O
rather O
we O
rather O
respect O
this O
position O
. O

Ok O
, O
Mr. O
Azam B-PERSON
al I-PERSON

Ahmed I-PERSON
, O
from O
another O
perspective O
, O
ah O
as O
you O
know O
Fatah B-ORG
formed O
all O
, O
if O
not O
most O
, O
of O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP

, O
I O
mean O
, O
have O
existed O
since O
the B-LAW

; O
Fatah B-ORG
also O
complied O
with O
international O
standards O
, O
as O
foreign O

say O
. O

But O
what O
was O
the O
outcome O
of O
that O
? O

I O
mean O
, O
we O
signed O
an O
agreement O
as O
a B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG

and O
ah O
the O
governments O
committed O
by O
the O

ah O
%pw O
-- O
we O
were O
continuously O

The O
outcome O
: O
we O
signed O
a O
principle O
agreement O
%pw O
for O
a O
three O

period O
. O

Israel B-GPE
ah O
was O
%pw O
setting O

We O
succeeded O

Yes O
. O

About O
a O
quarter O
million O
Palestinians B-NORP
returned O

to O
the O
agreement O
that O
was O
signed O
. O

And O
when O
Israel B-GPE
started O

disclaim O
the O

we O
clashed O

" O

out O
that O

When O

the O

" O

And O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
key O
is O
that O
when O
you O

with O
Taiwanese B-NORP
companies O
, O
you O
do O

Many O
Taiwanese B-NORP
believe O
that O
at O
a O
time O
of O
cross-strait O
tension O
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
firms O
have O
made O
their O
own O
decisions O
to O
invest O

therefore O
should O
bear O
the O

And O
by O

are O
they O
not O
to O

abandoning O

? O

TBAD B-ORG

this O

H.D. B-PERSON
Yeh I-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
in O
1998 B-DATE
Taiwan B-GPE
had O
an O
overall O
trade O
surplus O
of O
US$ B-MONEY
5.9 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
, O
and O
a O
surplus O
of O
US$ B-MONEY
12.76 I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
with O
mainland O
China B-GPE
. O

If O
not O
for O
its O
trade O
with O
the O
PRC B-GPE
, O
therefore O
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
would O
have O
had O
a O
trade O
deficit O
. O

" O
We O
make O
our O
money O
here O
, O
but O
we O
pay O
taxes O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
and O
most O
of O
our O

do O
most O

Former O

Jason B-PERSON

defends O
foreign O
aid O
by O
arguing O
that O
there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
kinds O
of O
countries O
in O
the O
world O
: O
those O
that O
help O
and O
those O
that O
need O
help O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
Taiwan B-GPE
was O
a O
recipient O
of O
American B-NORP
aid O
, O
so O
now O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
the O
economic O
power O
to O
return O
the O
favor O
to O
the O
international O
community O
, O
it O
should O
do O
so O
. O

Moreover O
, O
explains O
Hu O
, O
" O
In O
fact O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
Taiwan B-GPE
spends O
on O
foreign O
assistance O
is O
very O
limited O
. O

Currently O
the O
UN B-ORG
asks O
that O
OECD B-ORG
countries O
try O
to O
spend O
0.7 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
their O
GNP O
on O
foreign O
aid O
. O

Although O
most O
countries O
do O
not O
reach O
this O
level O
, O
most O
spend O
at B-PERCENT
least I-PERCENT
0.2 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

Taiwan B-GPE
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
spending O
only O
about B-PERCENT
0.1 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
! O
" O

Since O
there O
is O
a O
basic O
obligation O
to O
help O
all O
countries O
in O
need O
, O
and O
Taiwan B-GPE
is O
already O
doing O
less O
than O
it O
should O
, O
it O
is O
all O
the O
more O
understandable O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
gives O
aid O
to O
countries O

which O
it O

formal O

Relations O

Chang B-PERSON
continues O
: O
" O
It O
is O
shallow O
to O
see O
the O
maintenance O

relations O
between O
the O
ROC B-GPE

its O
diplomatic O
partners O
as O
depending O
only O
on O

some O
Latin B-NORP
American I-NORP
countries O
go O
back O
40 B-DATE
or I-DATE
50 I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Such O
a O
long O
period O
of O
friendship O
can O
not O
be O
explained O
only O
by O
the O
size O
or O
wealth O
of O
the O
countries O
involved O
. O

" O
In O
fact O
, O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
the O
PRC B-GPE
has O
spent O
much O
larger O
sums O
of O
money O
than O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
trying O
to O
woo O
away O
the O
ROC B-GPE

diplomatic O
partners O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
it O
often O
dangles O
its O
enormous O
domestic O
market O
before O
them O
as O
an O
inducement O
. O

Take O
for O
example O
the O
so O
- O
called O
" O
banana O
diplomacy O
" O
the O
PRC B-GPE
employed O
toward O
Costa B-GPE
Rica I-GPE
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

Attempting O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
bananas O
are O
Costa B-GPE
Rica I-GPE
's I-GPE
main O
export O
, O
the O
PRC B-GPE
, O
through O
private O
channels O
, O
indicated O
that O
it O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
purchase O
Costa B-NORP
Rican I-NORP
bananas O
at O
a O
high O
price O
. O

However O
, O
because O
the O
PRC B-GPE
has O
no O
formal O
diplomatic O
relations O
with O
Costa B-GPE
Rica I-GPE
, O
they O
would O
have O
to O
add O
a O
40 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
customs O
tax O
. O

This O
was O
clearly O
an O
effort O
to O
use O
commercial O
incentives O
to O
force O
the O
Costa B-NORP
Rican I-NORP
government O
's O
hand O
. O

As O
it O
turned O
out O
, O
Costa B-NORP
Rican I-NORP
bananas O
had O
been O
contracted O
out O
early O
to O
large O
corporations O
, O
and O
also O
some O
of O
the O
companies O
commissioned O
by O
the O
PRC B-GPE
failed O
to O
pay O
up O
as O
promised O
, O
causing O
Costa B-NORP
Rican I-NORP
farmers O
to O
lose O
confidence O
in O
them O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
PRC B-GPE
goal O
was O
not O
achieved O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
from O
this O
case O
you O
can O
see O
that O
PRC B-GPE
diplomacy O
has O
been O
extended O
to O
cover O
the O
commercial O
field O
as O
well O
. O

Learning O
from O
this O
, O
President O
Chen B-PERSON
says O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
must O
deepen O
its O
economic O
diplomacy O
. O

The O
government O
must O
take O
the O
lead O
in O
negotiating O
the O
construction O
of O
markets O
and O
the O
creation O
of O
business O
opportunities O
with O
other O
countries O

Meanwhile O
, O
businesses O
must O
collectively O
move O
to O
the O
front O

Only O
in O
this O
way O
can O
a O
win O
- O
win O
situation O
for O
both O
diplomacy O
and O
trade O
be O
created O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
been O
engaged O
in O
economic O
diplomacy O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
now O
, O
yet O
the O
results O
are O
not O

Jason B-PERSON

The O
number O
of O

diplomatic O

is O
far O
behind O
that O
of O
the O

, O
which O
seriously O
impedes O
Taiwan B-GPE

efforts O
to O

repeatedly O

it O
has O
met O
with O

the O

bear O
in O

ensure O
that O

However O
, O
because O

on O

have O
not O

believes O
that O

still O

room O
to O

But O
he O
suggested O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
should O
reconsider O
its O
tactical O

otherwise O
repeated O

" O
economic O
diplomacy O
, O
and O
entry O
into O

- O
differ O
little O
from O
the O
past O
, O
you O
must O
remember O
that O
diplomacy O
is O
a O
long O
- O
term O
game O
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O
details O
, O
the O
new O
foreign O
policy O

has O
already O
brought O
in O
some O
fresh O
air O
. O

For O
example O
, O
she O
notes O
, O
recently O
the O
MOFA B-ORG
, O
through O
its O
" O
virtual O
diplomacy O
institute O
, O
" O
has O
begun O
offering O
a O

The O
aim O
is O
to O
develop O
the O
capability O
to O
participate O
in O
international O
affairs O
among O
a O
wider O
public O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
government O
is O
continuing O
to O
encourage O
and O
assist O
private O
groups O
to O
participate O
in O
nongovernmental O
organizations O
, O
is O
eliminating O
the O
units O
abroad O
which O
have O
proven O
ineffective O
, O
and O
is O
promoting O
" O
human O

" O

All O
of O
these O
are O
new O
approaches O
in O

relates O
that O
, O
though O
there O
is O
no O
direct O
and O
immediate O
impact O
on O
inter-state O
relations O
as O
a O
result O
of O
private O
participation O
in O
nongovernmental O
organizations O
, O
nevertheless O
such O
participation O
can O
strengthen O
communication O
and O

between O

. O

The B-ORG

intends O
to O
establish O
a O

, O
led O
by O

to O
provide O

Lo B-PERSON
explains O
that O
in O
democratic O
countries O
, O
with O
whom O
Taiwan B-GPE
would O
like O
to O
strengthen O

, O
public O
opinion O
is O
the O

So O
over O
the O
long O

will O
definitely O
have O
a O
positive O

the O

" O

By O
emphasizing O
the O
government O

concern O
for O
human O

on O
the O
international O
stage O
, O
not O
only O
can O
Taiwan B-GPE
make O
its O
own O
democratization O
experience O
available O
for O
other O
countries O
currently O
going O
through O
the O

process O
, O
it O
can O
bring O
itself O
closer O
to O
those O
countries O
which O
also O
place O
a O
strong O
emphasis O
on O
human O

. O

Besides O
promoting O
new O
ideas O
, O
says O
Lo B-PERSON
, O
the O
MOFA B-ORG
is O
also O
undertaking O

In O

As O
Lo B-PERSON

" O
The O

move O

besides O

all O

which O

formal O

with O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

This O
visit O
, O
which O
has O
been O
called O
" O
soft O
diplomacy O
, O
" O
breaks O
the O
previous O
mold O
of O
focusing O
on O
political O
and O
economic O
power O
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
vice O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O
male O
way O
of O

, O
in O
which O
priority O
has O
always O
been O
given O
to O
considerations O

, O
Annette B-PERSON
Lu I-PERSON
has O
emphasized O
" O
soft O
national O
power O
. O
" O

Before O
her O
departure O
she O
stated O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
advocates O
human O
rights O
, O
democracy O
, O
high O
- O
technology O
, O
compassion O
, O
and O
peace O

If O
Taiwan B-GPE
can O
further O
develop O
foreign O

using O
such O
" O
soft O
power O
, O
" O
one O
day O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
will O
turn O
around O
and O
want O
Taiwan B-GPE
to O
join O
. O

Diplomats O
are O
anxious O
for O
a O
breakthrough O
that O
will O
reverse O
negative O
trends O
. O

But O
many O
people O
say O
that O
the O
root O
of O
the O
ROC B-GPE
's O
foreign O
policy O
difficulties O
is O
still O
in O
the O
relationship O
with O
the O
PRC B-GPE
. O

Right O
now O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
are O
at O
an O
impasse O
. O

It O
is O
unlikely O
there O
will O
be O
any O
progress O
on O
diplomatic O
or O
cross-strait O
issues O
between O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
sides O
. O

Before O
departing O
on O
his O
trip O
, O
President O
Chen B-PERSON
repeatedly O
stressed O
that O
, O
despite O
the O
tremendous O
pressure O
coming O
from O
the O
mainland O
, O
there O
are O
other O
considerations O
in O
foreign O
policy O
. O

Indeed O
, O
says O
Joanne B-PERSON
Chang I-PERSON
, O
it O
is O
precisely O
because O
diplomatic O
and O
cross-strait O
issues O
are O
inextricably O
intertwined O
that O
foreign O
policy O
breakthroughs O
are O
needed O
. O

If O
more O
states O
support O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
Taipei B-GPE
will O
have O
more O
cards O
to O
play O
in O
cross-strait O
negotiations O
, O
and O
domestic O
morale O
will O
be O
bolstered O
and O
people O
's O
fears O
alleviated O
. O

As O
President O
Chen B-PERSON

The O

the O

When O

Mr. O

he O
told O

that O
the O

`` O
made O

I O
regard O

a O
first B-ORDINAL

'' O

The O
communication O
Mr. O

brought O
represents O
the O
softer O
line O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
has O
been O
hoping O
to O
hear O
from O
Chinese B-NORP
officials O
since O
the O
June B-DATE

massacre O
of O
pro-democracy O

in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

The O
Chinese B-NORP
leader O
, O
Mr. O
Lee B-PERSON
informed O
Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
, O
expressed O
some O
regret O
for O
what O
had O
happened O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
and O
conceded O
that O
China B-GPE

officials O
bore O
some O
responsibility O
. O

Mr. O
Lee B-PERSON
says O
Mr. O
Deng B-PERSON
told O
him O
: O
`` O
We O
should O
not O
mind O
those O

on O
hunger O

'' O

Mr. O
Deng B-PERSON
added O
, O
says O
Mr. O

, O
that O
`` O
we O
really O
made O
mistakes O

We O
must O
not O
shirk O
our O
responsibility O
and O
we O
can O
not O
just O
blame O
the O

. O
'' O

Mr. O
Lee B-PERSON
also O
reported O
to O
the O
president O
that O
, O
in O
a O
separate O
meeting O
, O
Communist B-ORG
Party I-ORG
chief O
Jiang B-PERSON
Zemin I-PERSON
said O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
leadership O
`` O
looked O
kindly O
on O
the O
students O
who O
took O
part O
in O
the O
demonstrations O

'' O

Mr. O
Jiang B-PERSON
also O
pledged O
that O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
Red B-ORG
Cross I-ORG
would O
publish O
`` O
very O
soon O
'' O
a O
list O
of O
those O

And O
he O
told O
the O
physicist O
that O
China B-GPE

leaders O
were O
`` O
very O
much O
concerned O
'' O
about O
the O
deaths O

had O
arranged O
aid O
for O
the O
victims O

`` O
I O
transmitted O
my O

to O
the B-ORG

'' O
Prof. O

says O

But O
, O
he O
adds O
, O
`` O
I O
was O
not O
acting O
as O
a O
messenger O

'' O

He O
says O
that O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
never O
asked O
him O
to O
convey O
their O
statements O
to O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
, O
but O
that O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
spontaneously O
invited O
him O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Mr. O
Lee B-PERSON
concedes O
the O
statements O
made O
to O
him O
are O
far O
different O
from O
others O
being O
issued O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
but O
attributes O
that O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
situation O
in O
China B-GPE
is O
`` O
very O
complex O
. O
'' O

According O
to O
U.S. B-GPE
sources O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
the O
administration O
hopes O
Mr. O
Deng B-PERSON
's O
fairly O
conciliatory O
comments O
will O
prod O
Congress B-ORG
to O
be O
cautious O
about O
further O
sanctions O
against O
Beijing B-GPE

`` O

does O

says O
a O
U.S. B-GPE

`` O
But O
he O
may O

from O

, O
Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
may O
be O
unable O
to O
prevent O
new O

Beijing B-GPE
officials O
have O
said O
they O
will O
step O
up O
the O
campaign O
of O
arrests O
and O
intimidation O
against O
those O
who O

Mr. O

Before O

repeatedly O

KGB B-ORG
Border I-ORG
Guards I-ORG
, O
ethnically O
indistinguishable O
from O
Afghans B-NORP
and O
wearing O
unmarked O
uniforms O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
Kabul B-GPE
regime O
is O
increasingly O
successful O
at O
portraying O
the O
resistance O
as O
bloody O
- O
minded O
fanatics O
. O

In O
this O
they O
are O
aided O
by O
years B-DATE
of O
American B-NORP
, O
European B-NORP
, O
Pakistani B-NORP
and O
Saudi B-NORP
support O
for O
the O
most O
extreme O
factions O
-- O
radical O
Islamic B-NORP
fanatics O
with O
leaders O
whose O
policies O
are O
anathema O
to O
the O
Afghan B-NORP
public O
. O

This O
heavy O
outside O
support O
for O
the O
worst O
has O
undermined O
better O
, O
moderate O
leaders O
. O

In O
autumn B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
regime O
garrison O
at O
Kandahar B-GPE
was O
prepared O
to O
surrender O
the O
city O
to O
resistance O
moderates O
. O

At O
the O
last O
minute O
, O
however O
, O
Pakistani B-NORP
officials O
sent O
in O
Gulbuddin B-PERSON
Hekhmatyar I-PERSON
, O
perhaps O
the O
most O
hated O
and O
feared O
of O
the O
extremists O
, O
with O
a O
demand O
that O
the O
surrender O
be O
made O
to O
his O
forces O
. O

The O
deal O
fell O
through O
, O
and O
Kandahar B-GPE
remains O
a O
major O
regime O
base O
. O

The O
resistance O
lacks O
not O
only O
air O
power O
, O
armor O
and O
expertise O
but O
often O
such O
essentials O
as O
maps O
, O
mine O
detectors O
, O
or O
even O
winter B-DATE
gloves O
. O

Experienced O
resistance O
commanders O
wanted O
to O
use O
guerrilla O
action O
and O
siege O
tactics O
to O
wear O
down O
the O
regime O
. O

Instead O
, O
they O
were O
pressured O
by O
Pakistan B-GPE
's O
ISI B-ORG
, O
the O
channel O
for O
their O
support O
, O
into O
attacking O
Jalalabad B-GPE
. O

They O
took O
more O
than O
25 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
casualties O
; O
journalists O
report O
that O
they O
faced O
minefields O
without O
mine O
detectors O
. O

The O
wonder O
is O
not O
that O
the O
resistance O
has O
failed O
to O
topple O
the O
Kabul B-GPE
regime O
, O
but O
that O
it O
continues O
to O
exist O
and O
fight O
at O
all O
. O

Last B-DATE
summer I-DATE
, O
in O
response O
to O
congressional O
criticism O
, O
the B-ORG
State I-ORG
Department I-ORG
and O
the O
CIA B-ORG
said O
they O
had O
resumed O
military O
aid O
to O
the O
resistance O
months B-DATE
after O
it O
was O
cut O
off O
; O
but O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
how O
much O
is O
being O
sent O
or O
when O
it O
will O
arrive O
. O

For O
months B-DATE
the O
resistance O
has O
been O
defenseless O
against O
air O

Thus O
far O
there O
is O
no O
indication O
that O
they O
have O
been O
re-supplied O
with O
Stingers B-PRODUCT
or O
other O
anti-aircraft O
weapons O
. O

Indeed O
, O
U.S. B-GPE
officials O
have O
indicated O
to O
the O
press O
that O
the O
continuation O
of O
aid O
depends O
on O
what O
success O
the O
weakened O
resistance O
achieves O
by O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Moscow B-GPE
and O
Kabul B-GPE
must O
have O
found O
that O
information O
useful O
. O

For O
a B-DATE
decade I-DATE
U.S. B-GPE
policy O
has O
been O
incoherent O
, O
based O
on O
miscalculation O
and O
the O
defense O
of O
bureaucratic O
and O
political O
turf O
. O

No O
settlement O
negotiated O
by O
others O
can O
force O
the O
Afghan B-NORP
people O
to O
give O
up O
their O
struggle O
. O

A O
cutoff O
of O
U.S. B-GPE
military O
aid O
would O
merely O
abandon O

Creation O

Although O
Yeh B-PERSON

has O
worked O
in O
the O

industry O
, O
his O
field O
is O

. O

After O
graduating O
from O
college O
, O
Yeh B-PERSON
opened O
the B-ORG
Mingli I-ORG
Plastics I-ORG
Factory I-ORG
. O

Their O
first B-ORDINAL
product O
was O
a O
plastic O
cigarette O
case O
. O

Back O
in O
those O
days O
farmers O
would O
always O
put O
cigarettes O
in O
their O
pockets O
when O
they O
went O
to O
the O
fields O
, O
but O
they O
would O
often O
find O
that O
their O
cigarettes O
would O
get O
crushed O
before O
they O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
smoke O
them O
. O

Both O
the O
cases O
and O
the O
machines O
to O
make O
them O
sold O
well O
all O
over O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

Noting O
that O
glass O
baby O
bottles O
often O
cracked O
when O
boiled O
for O
sterilization O
, O
Yeh B-PERSON
then O
came O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
replacing O
glass O
with O
polyethylene O
. O

His O
factory O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
in O
the O
world O
to O
produce O
plastic O
baby O
bottles O
. O

Yeh B-PERSON
also O
made O
the O
sterilizers O
, O
and O
both O
lines O
proved O
to O
be O
very O
profitable O
. O

In O
was O
in O
this O
period O
that O
he O
met O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
factory O
across O
from O
his O
, O
who O
was O
a O
National B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
member O
. O

Through O
him O
, O
Yeh B-PERSON
reestablished O
connections O
with O
BCC B-ORG
and O
once O
again O
threw O
himself O
into O
the O
recording O
industry O
. O

Yeh B-PERSON
recalls O
a O
" O
beautiful O
accident O
" O
: O
He O
bought O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
- O
hand O
electroplater O
from O
a O
Japanese B-NORP
and O
tried O
to O
plate O
various O
plastic O
products O
with O
chrome O
so O
as O
to O
make O
them O
more O
resilient O
. O

Only O
after O
repeated O
failures O
and O
much O
frustration O
did O
he O
think O
about O
electroplating O
his O
black O
plastic O
albums O
with O
nickel O
and O
copper O
to O
make O
them O
stronger O
. O

This O
thrust O
him O
into O
the O
realm O
of O
media O
storage O
. O

" O
The O
times O
change O
faster O
with O
each O
wave O
, O
" O
says O
Yeh B-PERSON
. O

He O
explains O
that O
it O
took O
100 B-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
Edison B-PERSON
invented O
phonograph O
records O
for O
something O
better O
- O
laser O

. O

Their O

are O
now O
cresting O
, O
soon O
to O
be O
vanquished O
by O

, O
which O
though O
next O

are O
already O

Competing O
in O
the O

age O
, O
Yeh B-PERSON
has O
seen O
industries O
rise O
and O
fall O
. O

Resilient O
and O
flexible O
, O
he O
never O
recoils O
from O
challenges O
. O

Back O
when O
CDs O
were O
still O
in O
their O
infancy O
, O
Yeh B-PERSON
relied O
on O
his O
old O
relationship O
with O
Sony B-ORG
and O
found O
a O
team O
of O
engineers O
associated O
with O
the B-ORG
Industrial I-ORG
Technology I-ORG
Research I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
before O
he O
made O
a O
push O
into O
CD O
production O
. O

Starting O
from O
simple O
pieces O
of O
compressed O
plastic O
, O
they O
went O
one B-CARDINAL
step O
at O
a O
time O
, O
building O
a O
sturdy O
foundation O
of O
technical O
knowledge O
that O
Ritek B-ORG
still O
enjoys O
today B-DATE
. O

In O
1990 B-DATE
Ritek B-ORG
started O
to O
press O
CDs O
, O
becoming O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
mass O
- O
production O
manufacturer O
of O
CDs O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

Back O
then O
, O
it O
cost O
Japanese B-NORP
manufacturers O
about O
NT$ O
80 B-MONEY
to O
press O
one O
CD O
. O

Ritek B-ORG
garnered O
market O
share O
by O
undercutting O
the O
competition O
and O
charging O
only O
NT$ B-MONEY
50 I-MONEY
. O

With O
the O
support O
that O
Yeh B-PERSON
had O
long O
enjoyed O
in O
the O
recording O
industry O
here O
, O
Ritek B-ORG
was O
easily O
able O
to O
market O
its O
goods O
. O

What O
really O
brought O
Ritek B-ORG
into O
the O
realm O
of O
high O
- O
technology O
was O
developing O
its O
own O
CD O
- O
Rs O
-LRB- O
recordable O
CDs O
-RRB- O
. O

Taking O
a O
different O
tack O
from O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
, O
who O
were O
plating O
CD O
- O
Rs O
with O
a O
thin O
gold O
layer O
, O
Ritek B-ORG
instead O
developed O
a O
cheap O
and O
high O
- O
quality O
process O
for O
coating O
them O
with O
silver O
or O
aluminum O
. O

These O
allowed O
for O
a O
much O
lower O
price O
that O
in O
turn O
created O
more O
demand O
. O

It O
is O
yet O
another O
example O
of O
a O
Taiwanese B-NORP
company O
starting O
a O
global O
price O
war O
. O

Marching O
forward O

Being O
competitive O
in O
terms O
of O
price O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
Ritek B-ORG
's O
strong O
points O
, O
but O
it O
's O
not O
the O
whole O
story O
behind O
the O
company O
's O
success O
. O

Another O
important O
factor O
is O
that O
at O
key O
moments O
Yeh B-PERSON
has O
not O
hesitated O
to O
invest O
the O
necessary O
sums O
when O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
bring O
the O
technology O
to O
the O
next O
level O
. O

" O
Ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
when O
we O
first B-ORDINAL
started O
producing O
CDs O
, O
one O
machine O
required O
five B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
persons O
to O
operate O
, O
" O
Yeh B-PERSON
recalls O
. O

" O
When O
a O
flood O
of O
orders O
came O
in O
, O
we O
'd O
have O
everyone O
working O
overtime O
with O
shifts O
going O
around O
the O
clock O
, O
but O
we O
still O
were O
n't O
able O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
demand O
. O

That O
's O
when O
the O
workers O
took O
the O
initiative O
to O
suggest O
that O
we O
automate O
. O
" O

Now O
everything O
from O
ordering O
and O
production O
to O
storage O
and O
shipping O
is O
computerized O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
person O
is O
typically O
responsible O
for O
about B-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
machines O
. O

The O
whole O
process O
has O
been O
shortened O
, O
and O
quality O
is O
high O
. O

The O
amount O
that O
the O
same O
3,000 B-CARDINAL
workers O
can O
produce O
has O
exploded O
from O
200,000 B-CARDINAL
a O
month O
to O
200 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
a O
month O
. O

Automation O
has O
meant O
that O
the O
workers O
have O
had O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
operate O
sophisticated O
machinery O
and O
computers O
, O
so O
that O
Ritek B-ORG
has O
advanced O
out O
of O
the O
ranks O
of O
the O
traditional O
plastic O
disc O
pressers O
. O

Automation O
has O
also O
allowed O
the O
company O
to O
lower O
costs O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
price O
of O
data O
storage O
media O
has O
been O
plummeting O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
third I-DATE
quarter I-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
the O
price O
of O
a O
CD O
- O
ROM O
suddenly O
fell O
from O
60 B-MONEY
US I-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
to O
40 B-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
, O
which O
is O
n't O
far O
from O
the B-MONEY
30 I-MONEY
cents I-MONEY
it O
costs O
to O
make O
. O

It O
's O
a O
long O
way O
from O
the O
US$ O
14 B-MONEY
that O
they O
cost O
when O
they O
first B-ORDINAL
hit O
the O
market O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

Yet O
Ritek B-ORG
has O
still O
managed O
to O
maintain O
operating O
profits O
of O
22 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
and O
the O
falling O
prices O
have O
n't O
crushed O
it O
. O

The O
coming O
wave O
of O
technology O
will O
focus O
on O
light O
and O
small O
portable O
data O
devices O
such O
as O
PDAs O
and O
MP3 O
players O
, O
so O
the O
challenge O
for O
Ritek B-ORG
is O
allowing O
devices O
that O
are O
becoming O
smaller O
and O
smaller O
to O
have O
larger O
data O
capacities O
and O
higher O
fidelity O
. O

Yeh B-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
the O
patent O
rights O
for O
mini-discs O
are O
owned O
entirely O
by O
big O
Japanese B-NORP
companies O
, O
but O
Ritek B-ORG
is O
the O
only O
company O
manufacturing O
them O
. O

Ritek B-ORG
is O
also O
part O
of O
a O
group O
-LRB- O
which O
includes O
Dataplay B-ORG
, O
Samsung B-ORG

Toshiba B-ORG
-RRB- O
that O
is O
researching O

developing O
a O
data O
storage O
device O
no O
larger O
than O
a O
wrist O
watch O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
applications O
for O
it O
. O

Ritek B-ORG
will O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
production O
of O
the O
disk O
. O

A B-DATE

and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE

Ritek B-ORG
invested O

the O

Currently O
Ritek B-ORG

This O

" O
In O
the O

" O
I O
study O

He O
often O

As O

that O

'' O

Mr. O

said O
the O

Mr. O

Dennis B-PERSON

JP B-ORG

Clinic I-ORG
strikes O
a O
cautionary O
note O
: O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
education O
system O
has O
fulfilled O
its O
responsibility O
to O
teach O
people O
how O
to O
manage O
their O
money O
. O
" O

Chien B-PERSON
points O
out O
that O
school O
textbooks O
only O
teach O
moral O
lessons O
like O
" O
a B-MONEY
penny I-MONEY
saved O
is O
a B-MONEY
penny I-MONEY
earned O
, O
" O
which O
are O
not O
exactly O
what O
the O
real O
world O
demands O
these B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
many O
American B-NORP
children O
understand O
a O
bit O
about O
money O
management O
from O
early O
on O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
child O
in O
her B-DATE
early I-DATE
teens I-DATE
might O
babysit O
for O
the O
neighbors O
or O
cut O
lawns O
, O
and O
then O
put O
the O
money O
in O
a O
mutual O
fund O
. O

Some O
investment O
websites O
have O
games O
for O
children O
to O
teach O
them O
about O
various O
investment O
instruments O
and O
portfolios O
. O

These O
treat O
personal O
money O
management O
as O
a O
serious O
life O
skill O
that O
all O
modern O
people O
should O
know O
. O

Chien B-PERSON
says O
that O
the O
situation O
is O
just O
like O
sex O
education O
in O
the O
past O
. O

They O
give O
it O
only O
the O
most O
cursory O
treatment O
in O
schools O
, O
but O
most O
people O
have O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
find O
out O
about O
it O
, O
so O
as O
a O
result O
they O
have O
to O
pick O
up O
what O
they O
can O
from O
the O
newspapers O
or O
cable O
TV O
. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
a O
proper O
investment O
outlook O
is O
that O
speculation O
is O
rampant O
. O

According O
to O
statistics O
of O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
, O
87.5 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
trading O
volume O
on O
the O
Taiwan B-GPE
stock O
exchange O
comes O
from O
individual O
investors O
. O

In O
1999 B-DATE
turnover O
was O
288 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
-LRB- O
that O
is O
, O
total O
trading O
volume O
was O
2.88 B-CARDINAL
times O
the O
total O

of O
the O

-RRB- O
, O
which O
, O
though O
considerably O
down O
from O
nearly O
600 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
before I-DATE
, O
remained O
four B-CARDINAL
times O
higher O
than O
the B-ORG

. O

Despite O
numerous O
painful O
lessons O
in O
the O
past O
, O
the O
habit O
of O
chasing O
a O
rising O
market O
and O
cutthroat O
selling O
in O
a O
falling O
market O
has O
proven O
difficult O
to O
change O
. O

A O
new O
climate O
for O
the O
e-generation O

Fortunately O
, O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
foreign O
investors O
have O
brought O
some O
new O
ideas O
into O
the O
country O
. O

Although O
they O
still O
engage O
in O
" O
hit O
- O
and O
- O
run O
" O
high O
- O
volume O
trading O
for O
quick O
gains O
, O
at O
least O
most O
foreign O
investors O
ignore O
gossip O
and O
do O
n't O
touch O
the O
more O
speculative O
stocks O
. O

Rather O
, O
they O
put O
more O
emphasis O
on O
the O
fundamentals O
of O
a O
given O
company O
or O
industry O
. O

Dennis B-PERSON
Chien I-PERSON
notes O
that O
foreign O
firms O
have O
also O
introduced O
risk O
management O
ideas O
like O
" O
having O
a O
well O
- O
rounded O
portfolio O
" O
-LRB- O
i.e. O
" O
do O
n't O
put O
all O
your O
eggs O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
basket O
" O
-RRB- O
. O

These O
have O
had O
a O
positive O
impact O
on O
the O
local O
stock O
market O
, O
and O
have O
given O
the O
investment O
activities O
of O
the O
e-generation O
a O
more O
rational O
foundation O
than O
those O
of O
their O
parents O
. O

The O
chief O
characteristics O
of O
the O
current O
wave O
of O
e-generation O
personal O
money O
management O
are O
great O
ambition O
, O
reliance O
on O
expert O
analysis O
, O
and O
diversification O
of O
investment O
targets O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
hottest O
investments O
are O
always O
changing O
, O
and O
perhaps O
no O
amount O
of O
rational O
analysis O
or O
detailed O
information O
will O
be O
able O
to O
change O
this O
. O

of O

in O
Taiwan B-GPE
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
offers O
the O
following O
thoughts O
about O
trends O
in O
money O
management O
. O

Chia B-PERSON
recalls O
that O
in O
the B-DATE
1960s I-DATE
, O
people O
were O
too O
poor O
to O
have O
any O
money O
to O
manage O
; O
there O
were O
also O
fears O
of O
war O
, O
and O
so O
any O
money O
people O
did O
have O
they O
quickly O
exchanged O
for O
gold O
or O
US B-GPE
dollars O
on O
the O
black O
market O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
1970s I-DATE
, O
faced O
with O
two B-CARDINAL
oil O
crises O
and O
inflation O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
buying O
property O
to O
preserve O
value O
became O
widespread O
, O
and O
those O
who O
could O
afford O
it O
bought O
land O
and O
houses O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
the O
stock O
market O
had O
only O
a B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
so I-CARDINAL
listed O
companies O
, O
and O
its O
fate O
depended O
on O
a O
few O
manipulators O
behind O
the O
scenes O
. O

It O
was O
seen O
as O
a O
" O
cannibalistic O
market O
" O
which O
scared O
off O
most O
citizens O
. O

The O
past O
is O
gone O

The O
real O
fad O
for O
personal O
money O
management O
only O
hit O
Taiwan B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
mid-1980s I-DATE
. O

It O
was O
then O
that O
the O
country O
's O
accumulated O
economic O
resources O
began O
to O
come O
to O
the O
surface O
. O

The O
huge O
trade O
surplus O
built O
up O
over O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
caused O
the O
NT O
dollar O
to O
appreciate O
, O
and O
attracted O
a O
huge O
amount O
of O
speculative O
foreign O
money O
into O
Taiwan B-GPE
. O

The O
stock O
market O
index O
rose O
from O
600 B-CARDINAL
or O
so O
in O
1985 B-DATE
to O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
12,000 I-CARDINAL
by O
1990 B-DATE
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
price O
of O
property O
rose O
from O
an O
average O
of O
NT$ B-MONEY
71,800 I-MONEY
per O
ping O
-LRB- B-QUANTITY
about I-QUANTITY
3.3 I-QUANTITY

-RRB- I-QUANTITY
in O
1986 B-DATE
to O
NT$ B-MONEY
284,500 I-MONEY
per O
ping O
in O
1989 B-DATE
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
great O
opportunities O
for O
making O
money O
stared O
one O
right O
in O
the O
face O
. O

In O
pursuit O
of O
overnight O
wealth O
, O
many O
people O
mortgaged O
their O
property O
to O
buy O
stocks O
, O
and O
then O
used O
their O
stocks O
as O
collateral O
to O
borrow O
more O
money O
, O
creating O
a O
vicious O
cycle O
that O
laid O
the O
foundation O
for O
the O
burst O
bubble O
and O
huge O
debts O
of O
later O
years O
. O

But O
, O
having O
reviewed O
the O
past O
, O
Chia B-PERSON
Chen I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
i I-PERSON
declares O
: O
" O
In O
money O
management O
, O
you O
can O
only O
look O
to O
the O
future O
; O
there O
's O
no O
point O
in O
regretting O
what O
's O
gone O
. O
" O

Indeed O
, O
in O
the O
era O
of O
the O
Internet O
, O
with O
everything O
moving O
much O
faster O
, O
investment O
indicators O
like O
product O
popularity O
and O
employment O
trends O
can O
change O
overnight O
. O

Those O
who O
can O
not O
see O
the O
trends O
or O
who O
can O
not O
react O
fast O
enough O
are O
doomed O
to O
be O
the O
losers O
in O
the O
wealth O

. O

Take O
for O
example O
the O
case O
of O
Mrs. O
Chang B-PERSON
. O

Widowed O
at O
an O
early O
age O
, O
for O
over O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
she O
supported O
her O
family O
as O
an O
independent O
real O

broker O
. O

Her O
success O
made O
her O
very O
confident O
about O
her O
understanding O
of O
the O
property O
market O
. O

Six B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
she O
decided O
to O
help O
the O
family O
of O
her O
younger O
brother O
, O
who O
contracted O
a O
terminal O
illness O
, O
to O
buy O
a O
new O
house O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
the O
price O
of O
high O
- O
rise O
apartments O
in O
the B-FAC
Tanshui I-FAC
New I-FAC

had O
fallen O
from O
NT$ B-MONEY
220,000 I-MONEY
per O
ping O
to O
NT$ B-MONEY
150,000 I-MONEY
. O

Congratulating O
herself O
on O
getting O
a O
low O
price O
, O
and O
confident O
that O
the O
market O
would O
rebound O
, O
Mrs. O
Chang B-PERSON
happily O
put O
down O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
payment O
and O
watched O
her O
brother O

family O
move O
in O
. O

However O
, O
it O
was O
about O
this O
time O
that O
many O
new O

started O
earlier O
by O
construction O
firms O
hoping O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O

the O

. O

The O
number O
of O
empty O

rose O
to O
over O
one B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

Next O
, O
increased O
cross-strait O

put O
a O
further O

on O
the O

Mrs. O
Chang B-PERSON
's O
brother O
's O
family O
is O
stuck O
with O
a O
heavy O
mortgage O
, O
and O
there O
are O
constant O
recriminations O
between O
Mrs. O
Chang B-PERSON
and O
her O
nieces O
and O
nephews. O

Will O
the O
Taiwan B-GPE
property O
market O
inevitably O
recover O
? O

Not O
necessarily O
. O

Looking O
around O
the O
world O
, O
at O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
Japan B-GPE
, O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
, O
and O
even O
mainland O
China B-GPE
, O
there O
are O
countless O
examples O
of O
long O
- O
term O
downturns O
in O
the O
housing O
market O
. O

The O
popular O
book O
Die B-WORK_OF_ART
Broke I-WORK_OF_ART
notes O
that O
the O
sharp O
rise O
in O
housing O
prices O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
1960s I-DATE
and I-DATE
1970s I-DATE
was O
due O
to O
underlying O
structural O
factors O
: O

The O
large O
generation O
of O
" O
baby O
boomers O
" O
were O
starting O
careers O
and O
families O
, O
thereby O
increasing O
demand O
for O
housing O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
some O
of O
the O
older O
generation O
about O
to O
retire O
happily O
sold O
their O
houses O
to O
the O
younger O
at O
high O
prices O
. O

The O
large O
profits O
they O
earned O
attracted O
numerous O
speculators O
into O
the O
market O
, O
and O
prices O
were O
driven O
even O
higher O
, O
encouraging O
construction O
of O
ever O
more O
homes O
. O

But O
now O
that O
most O
of O
the O
baby O

have O
their O
own O
homes O
, O
and O
the O
current O
" O

" O
is O
smaller O
, O
who O
are O
all O
those O
extra O
homes O
going O
to O
be O
sold O
to O
? O

Snafu O

The O
upshot O
of O
all O
this O
is O

cautions O
: O
" O
There O
are O
no O
absolute O

at O

" O

So O
- O
called O

are O
simply O
those O
who O
have O
particular O

about O
a O

he O

looking O

can O

lead O

in O

the O

According O

out O

core O
principles O
for O

is O
to O
not O

" O
This O
is O
because O
I O

She O
says O
that O
anxiety O

The O
more O
you O

the O
more O

the O
greater O
will O
be O
the O
sense O
of O

if O
you O
fail O

In O
other O
words O

anxiety O
derives O
from O
greed O

" O
If O

it O

you O

" O
says O

This O

She O

today B-DATE

how O

provide O
every O

with O

intelligently O

For O

But O
how O
much O

is O

That O
depends O
on O
the O
values O
of O
the O

" O
Each O

not O

" O
says O
Chen B-PERSON
. O

After O
all O
, O
in O
a O
pluralized O
society O

there O
should O
be O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
definition O
of O

Recently O
there O
was O
a O

about O
the O

having O
to O
sell O

One B-CARDINAL

took O
Chang B-PERSON
as O
an O
object O
lesson O
to O
" O
warn O
" O
people O
to O
learn O
how O
to O

Yet O
, O
looking O
at O
this O
another O
way O
, O
if O
Chang B-PERSON
had O
spent O
his O
youth O
worrying O
about O
accumulating O
money O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
had O
the O
experiences O
he O
did O
and O
made O
his O
way O
from O
being O
an O
ordinary O
soldier O
to O
writing O
such O
moving O

. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
there O
are O
no O
numbers O
that O
can O
validly O
measure O
what O
has O
been O
gained O
in O
life O
, O
and O
what O

It O
is O
said O
that O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
biggest O
causes O
of O
family O
arguments O
this B-DATE

have O
been O
differences O
over O

over O
what O
stocks O

As O
Jessica B-PERSON
Liu I-PERSON
reminds O
us O
, O
money O
management O
, O
like O
life O
itself O
, O
is O
an O
accumulation O
of O
small O
experiences O
, O
a O
long O
road O
with O
ups O

downs O
, O
and O
so O
should O
be O
faced O
with O
equanimity O

After O
all O
, O
is O
n't O
the O
point O
of O
making O
money O
to O
have O
a O
better O
life O
? O

But O
if O
you O

your O
health O

your O

only O
at O

what O

Legal O
controversies O
in O
America B-GPE
have O
a O
way O
of O
assuming O
a O
symbolic O
significance O
far O
exceeding O
what O
is O
involved O
in O
the O
particular O
case O
. O

They O
speak O
volumes O
about O
the O
state O
of O
our O
society O
at O
a O
given O
moment O
. O

It O
has O
always O
been O
so O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
1920s I-DATE
, O
a O
young O
schoolteacher O
, O
John B-PERSON
T. I-PERSON
Scopes I-PERSON
, O
volunteered O
to O
be O
a O
guinea O
pig O
in O
a O
test O
case O
sponsored O
by O
the B-ORG
American I-ORG
Civil I-ORG
Liberties I-ORG
Union I-ORG
to O
challenge O
a O
ban O
on O
the O
teaching O
of O
evolution O
imposed O
by O
the O
Tennessee B-GPE
Legislature B-ORG
. O

The O
result O
was O
a O
world O
- O
famous O
trial O
exposing O
profound O
cultural O
conflicts O
in O
American B-NORP
life O
between O
the O
`` O
smart O
set O
, O
'' O
whose O
spokesman O
was O
H.L. B-PERSON
Mencken I-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
religious O
fundamentalists O
, O
whom O
Mencken B-PERSON
derided O
as O
benighted O
primitives O
. O

Few O
now O
recall O
the O
actual O
outcome O
: O
Scopes B-PERSON
was O
convicted O
and O
fined O
$ O
100 B-MONEY
, O
and O
his O
conviction O
was O
reversed O
on O
appeal O
because O
the O
fine O
was O
excessive O
under O
Tennessee B-GPE
law O
. O

So O
it O
was O
with O
the O
Hiss B-PERSON
case O
a B-DATE
generation I-DATE
later I-DATE
, O
when O
Alger B-PERSON
Hiss I-PERSON
became O
a O
lightning O
rod O
for O
the O
anxieties O
of O
the B-EVENT
Cold I-EVENT
War I-EVENT
and O
conflicting O
attitudes O
toward O
the O
New O
Deal O
he O
had O
served O
. O

His O
trials O
aroused O
public O
passions O
out O
of O
all O
proportion O
to O
the O
rather O
banal O
secrets O
he O
allegedly O
had O
passed O
to O
Soviet B-NORP
intelligence O
. O

And O
so O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
with O
the O
case O
of O
Elizabeth B-PERSON
Morgan I-PERSON
, O
the O
Washington B-GPE
, O
D.C. B-GPE
, O
plastic O
surgeon O
jailed O
in O
a O
child O
custody O
case O
for O
refusing O
to O
reveal O
the O
whereabouts O
of O
her O
daughter O
. O

Dr. O
Morgan B-PERSON
has O
just O
emerged O
from O
the O
D.C. B-GPE
jail O
after O
more B-DATE
than I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
' I-DATE
confinement O
for O
contempt O
of O
court O
, O
a O
heroine O
to O
her O
many O
supporters O
. O

To O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
, O
the O
case O
is O
a O
puzzle O
. O

It O
is O
what O
lawyers O
call O
`` O
fact O
intensive O
. O
'' O

It O
presents O
no O
great O
issue O
of O
legal O
principle O
, O
no O
overriding O
question O
of O
family O
law O
or O
the O
law O
of O
contempt O
. O

Instead O
, O
it O
turns O
on O
the O
disputed O
and O
elusive O
facts O
of O
`` O
who O
did O
what O
to O
whom O
. O
'' O

It O
is O
difficult O
, O
if O
not O
impossible O
, O
for O
anyone O
who O
has O
not O
pored O
over O
the O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
pages O
of O
court O
pleadings O
and O
transcripts O
to O
have O
a O
worthwhile O
opinion O
on O
the O
underlying O
merits O
of O
the O
controversy O
. O

Certainly O
I O
do O
not O
. O

So O
we O
must O
look O
elsewhere O
for O
an O
explanation O
of O
the O
unusual O
power O
this O
case O
has O
exerted O
over O
the O
minds O
of O
many O
, O
not O
just O
in O
Washington B-GPE
but O
elsewhere O
in O
the O
country O
and O
even O
the O
world O
. O

I O
suggest O
that O
three B-CARDINAL
themes O
have O
come O
together O
in O
the O
strange O
case O
of O
Dr. O
Morgan B-PERSON
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
is O
that O
it O
represents O
an O
intense O
battle O
in O
what O
James B-PERSON
Thurber I-PERSON
used O
to O
caricature O
as O
`` O
the O
war O
between O
the O
sexes O
. O
'' O

But O
although O
Thurber B-PERSON
did O
so O
gently O
and O
lightheartedly O
, O
many O
of O
Dr. O
Morgan B-PERSON
's O
supporters O
have O
taken O
Thurber B-PERSON
's O
memorable O
title O
`` O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Male I-WORK_OF_ART
Animal I-WORK_OF_ART
'' O
quite O
literally O
. O

The O
vehemence O
of O
the O
emotions O
aroused O
by O
the O
case O
testifies O
to O
its O
symbolic O
importance O
in O
the O
war O
that O
Thurber B-PERSON
accepted O
as O
an O
eternal O
part O
of O
the O
human O
condition O
. O

A O
second B-ORDINAL
theme O
is O
the O
undercurrent O
of O
social O
class O
and O
race O
in O
the O
public O
reaction O
to O
the O
Morgan B-PERSON
case O
. O

Dr. O
Morgan B-PERSON
is O
a O
highly O
educated O
white O
professional O
who O
attended O
some O
of O
the O
`` O
best O
'' O
schools O
. O

As O
members O
of O
the B-ORG
Black I-ORG
Caucus I-ORG
in O
Congress B-ORG
asked O
during O
the O
debate O
on O
the O
legislation O
that O
freed O
Dr. O
Morgan B-PERSON
, O
does O
anyone O
seriously O
believe O
that O
if O
she O
were O
an O
uneducated O
, O
black O
, O
working O
- O
class O
woman O
, O
Congress B-ORG
would O
have O
rushed O
to O
pass O
a O
private O
relief O
bill O
freeing O
her O
? O

Or O
that O
the O
president O
would O
have O
hurried O
to O
sign O
the O
bill O
`` O
out O
of O
compassion O
for O
her O
plight O
'' O
? O

To O
ask O
those O
questions O
is O
to O
answer O
them O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
case O
of O
Dr. O
Morgan B-PERSON
gave O
Congress B-ORG
an O
opportunity O
to O
act O
with O
unaccustomed O
decisiveness O
and O
to O
engage O
in O
one O
of O
its O
favorite O
pastimes O
-- O
bashing O
the O
District B-GPE
of I-GPE
Columbia I-GPE
government O
. O

The O
local O
government O
is O
discredited O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
many O
residents O
for O
a O
variety O
of O
reasons O
, O
and O
congressmen O
read O
the O
same O
newspapers O
and O
watch O
the O
same O
TV O
newscasts O
as O
other O
people O
in O
the O
area O
do O
. O

Bashing O
the O
D.C. B-GPE
government O
is O
risk O
- O
free O
for O
members O
of O
Congress B-ORG
, O
who O
do O
not O
have O
to O
answer O
to O
their O
own O
constituents O
for O
it O
. O

Congress B-ORG
is O
paralyzed O
from O
acting O
on O
such O
great O
issues O
of O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
as O
the O
federal O
budget O
deficit O
. O

Yet O
a O
bill O
tailored O
to O
the O
interests O
of O
a O
single O
individual O
passed O
Congress B-ORG
with O
almost O
unimaginable O
speed O
, O
before O
the O
judicial O
process O
had O
run O
its O
course O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
while O
the O
Morgan B-PERSON
case O
was O
awaiting O
a O
ruling O
by O
the O
appellate O
court O
. O

The O
Morgan B-PERSON
case O
thus O
tells O
us O
much O
more O
about O
the O
current O
state O
of O
sex O
, O
class O
, O
race O
and O
politics O
in O
our O
society O
than O
it O
does O
about O
the O
facts O
of O
Dr. O
Morgan B-PERSON
's O
particular O
situation O
. O

It O
may O
stand O
as O
a O
metaphor O
for O
how O
wide O
and O
deep O
the O
divisions O
in O
that O
society O
continue O
to O
be O
however O
we O
try O
to O
deny O
their O
existence O
. O

they O

I O
think O
that O
sometimes O
it O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
to O
be O
ticketed O
by O
Uncle B-ORG
Policeman I-ORG
. O

I O
remember O
reading O
a O
post O
by O
a O
fellow O
student O
, O
who O
said O
that O
he O
was O
in O
a O
very O
complicated O
frame O
of O
mind O
after O
seeing O
his O
parents O
taking O
off O
at O
the O
airport O
, O
and O
sped O
up O
to O
120 B-QUANTITY
miles O
on O
the O
highway O
while O
listening O
to O
Swan B-WORK_OF_ART
Lake I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

I O
have O
never O
driven O
on O
the O
highway O
, O
but O
this O
should O
have O
been O
speeding O
, O
right O
. O

I O
feel O
that O
he O
was O
extremely O
unlucky O
not O
to O
have O
encountered O
a O
police O
officer O
, O

Some O
things O
, O
some O
people O
are O
just O
this O
way O
. O

He O
always O
finds O
you O
when O
there O
is O
nothing O
wrong O
, O
but O
disappears O
whenever O
he O
is O
needed O
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
this O
fellow O
student O
had O
the O
real O
bad O
luck O
not O
to O
have O
encountered O
a O
police O
officer O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
he O
drove O
faster O
and O
faster O
until O
finally O
at O
140 B-QUANTITY
miles O
, O
he O
sped O
off O
the O
highway O
and O
plunged O
into O
the O
woods O
. O

But O
fortunately O
, O
people O
's O
luck O
always O
tends O
to O
balance O
out O
. O

Although O
this O
fellow O
student O
did O
not O
encounter O
a O
police O
officer O
, O
at O
least O
he O
was O
not O
injured O
in O
the O
accident O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
he O
would O
have O
fallen O
into O
a O
river O
had O
he O
left O
the O
highway O
a O
moment O
later O
. O

So O
upon O
getting O
a O
ticket O
, O
just O
consider O
it O
the O
expense O
of O
averting O
a O
disaster O
. O


Secretary O
of O
State B-ORG
Baker B-PERSON
, O
we O
read O
, O
decided O
to O
kill O
a O
speech O
that O
Robert B-PERSON
Gates I-PERSON
, O
deputy O
national O
security O
adviser O
and O
a O
career O
Soviet B-NORP
expert O
, O
was O
going O
to O
give O
to O
a O
student O
colloquium O
, O
the O
National O
Collegiate O
Security O
Conference O
. O

We O
keep O
wondering O
what O
Mr. O
Gates B-PERSON
wanted O
to O
say O
. O

Perhaps O
he O
might O
have O
cited O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
's O
need O
for O
`` O
a O
stable O
currency O
, O
free O
and O
competitive O
markets O
, O
private O
property O
and O
real O
prices O
'' O
and O
other O
pie O
- O
in O
- O
the O
- O
sky O
reforms O
. O

Perhaps O
he O
'd O
have O
called O
for O
`` O
a O
decentralized O
political O
and O
economic O
system O
'' O
without O
a O
dominant O
communist O
party O
. O

Or O
political O
arrangements O
`` O
to O
alleviate O
the O
grievances O
and O
demands O
of O
Soviet B-NORP
ethnic O
minorities O
and O
republics O
. O
'' O

Why O
, O
a B-PERSON
Bob I-PERSON
Gates I-PERSON
might O
even O
have O
said O
, O
`` O
Nor O
are O
Soviet B-NORP
problems O
susceptible O
to O
rescue O
from O
abroad O
through O
abundant O
Western O
credits O
. O
'' O

If O
Mr. O
Gates B-PERSON
had O
been O
allowed O
to O
say O
these O
things O
, O
we O
would O
now O
be O
hearing O
about O
`` O
discord O
'' O
and O
`` O
disarray O
'' O
on O
foreign O
policy O
. O

Dark O
hints O
would O
be O
raised O
that O
parts O
of O
the O
administration O
hope O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
would O
fail O
, O
just O
as O
they O
were O
when O
Vice O
President O
Quayle B-PERSON
voiced O
similar O
sentiments O
. O

It O
's O
somehow O
OK O
for O
Secretary O
Baker B-PERSON
himself O
, O
however O
, O
to O
say O
all O
the O
same O
things O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
he O
did O
; O
the O
quotes O
above O
are O
from O
Mr. O
Baker B-PERSON
's O
speech O
of O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

So O
far O
as O
we O
can O
see O
, O
there O
is O
no O
disagreement O
among O
Mr. O
Baker B-PERSON
, O
Mr. O
Quayle B-PERSON
, O
the O
Mr. O
Gates B-PERSON
we O
've O
read O
, O
or O
for O
that O
matter O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
. O

They O
all O
understand O
point O
one B-CARDINAL
: O
Nothing O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
can O
do O
will O
make O
much O
difference O
in O
whether O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
succeeds O
with O
perestroika O
. O

Perhaps O
Mr. O
Gates B-PERSON
would O
emphasize O
more O
than O
Mr. O
Baker B-PERSON
the O
many O
hurdles O
the O
Soviet B-NORP
leader O
must O
leap O
if O
he O
is O
going O
to O
succeed O
. O

But O
everyone O
agrees O
that O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
's O
problems O
result O
from O
the O
failure O
of O
his O
own O
system O
. O

They O
can O
be O
relieved O
only O
by O
changing O
that O
system O
, O
not O
by O
pouring O
Western O
money O
into O
it O
. O

GATT B-ORG
membership O
will O
not O
matter O
to O
Donbas B-GPE
coal O
miners O
short O
of O
soap O
, O
nor O
will O
a O
START B-LAW
treaty O
make O
any O
difference O
to O
Ukrainian B-GPE
nationalists O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
so O
long O
as O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
is O
easing O
his O
grip O
on O
his O
empire O
, O
everyone O
we O
've O
heard O
agrees O
that O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
can O
benefit O
by O
engaging O
him O
. O

If O
a O
deal O
can O
be O
made O
to O
cut O
the O
world O
's O
Ortegas B-PERSON
loose O
from O
Moscow B-GPE
, O
why O
not O
? O

We O
do O
n't O
expect O
much O
good O
from O
nuclear O
- O
arms O
control O
, O
but O
conventional O
- O
arms O
talks O
might O
demilitarize O
Eastern B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
. O

There O
's O
nothing O
in O
the O
least O
contradictory O
in O
all O
this O
, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
think O
that O
Washington B-GPE
could O
tolerate O
a O
reasonably O
sophisticated O
, O
complex O
view O
. O

Yet O
much O
of O
the O
political O
culture O
seems O
intent O
on O
castigating O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
for O
not O
`` O
helping O
'' O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
. O

So O
every O
time O
a O
Bush B-PERSON
official O
raises O
a O
doubt O
about O
Mr. O
Gorbachev B-PERSON
, O
the O

In O

the O

It O

`` O

`` O

second B-ORDINAL

'' O

I O
am O
not O
a O
proponent O
of O
everything O
Gandhi B-PERSON
did O
, O
but O
some O
of O
his O
law O
breaking O
was O
justified O
because O
India B-GPE
was O
then O
under O
occupation O
by O
a O
foreign O
power O
, O
and O
Indians B-NORP
were O
not O
able O
to O
participate O
fully O
in O
decisions O
that O
vitally O
affected O
them O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
, O
however O
, O
to O
justify O
civil O
disobedience O
, O
non-violent O
or O
not O
, O
where O
citizens O
have O
full O
recourse O
to O
the O
ballot O
box O
to O
effect O
change O
. O

Where O
truly O
representative O
governments O
are O
safeguarded O
by O
constitutional O
protections O
of O
human O
rights O
and O
an O
independent O
judiciary O
to O
construe O
those O
rights O
, O
there O
is O
no O
excuse O
for O
breaking O
the O
law O
because O
some O
individual O
or O
group O
disagrees O
with O
it O
. O

There O
may O
be O
a O
few O
cases O
where O
the O
law O
breaking O
is O
well O
pinpointed O
and O
so O
completely O
non-invasive O
of O
the O
rights O
of O
others O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
criticize O
it O
. O

The O
case O
of O
Rosa B-PERSON
Parks I-PERSON
, O
the O
black O
woman O
who O
refused O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
bus O
, O
comes O
to O
mind O
as O
an O
illustration O
. O

But O
most O
cases O
of O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
are O
not O
nearly O
so O
benign O
. O

The O
public O
has O
a O
tendency O
to O
equate O
lawful O
demonstrations O
with O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
both O
are O
non-violent O
, O
but O
there O
is O
a O
fundamental O
difference O
between O
them O
. O

Lawful O
demonstrations O
, O
such O
as O
peaceful O
picketing O
and O
other O
assemblages O
that O
do O
not O
disturb O
the O
peace O
or O
cause O
a O
public O
nuisance O
or O
interfere O
with O
the O
rights O
of O
others O
, O
are O
rights O
guaranteed O
by O
any O
truly O
free O
system O
of O
government O
. O

Civil O
disobedience O
, O
violent O
or O
non-violent O
, O
is O
intentional O
law O
breaking O
. O

The O
subject O
of O
this O
discussion O
is O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
; O
but O
, O
before O
we O
get O
on O
with O
that O
, O
let O
me O
make O
just O
a O
few O
tangential O
remarks O
about O
lawful O
demonstrations O
. O

They O
are O
useful O
to O
call O
public O
attention O
to O
grievances O
, O
but O
they O
have O
little O
value O
in O
educating O
anyone O
about O
the O
issues O
in O
dispute O
. O

The O
delight O
of O
television O
in O
dramatic O
confrontation O
encourages O
overuse O
of O
slogans O
chanted O
through O
bullhorns O
, O
militant O
gestures O
, O
accusatory O
signs O
and O
other O
emotionally O
inspired O
tactics O
. O

Civilized O
discourse O
and O
an O
environment O
where O
compromise O
can O
begin O
are O
lost O
in O
a O
hostile O
posture O
abetted O
by O
superficial O
media O
interviews O
. O

At O
best O
, O
demonstrations O
are O
overused O
and O
boringly O
uninformative O
; O
at O
worst O
, O
they O
can O
become O
the O
stimuli O
that O
lead O
to O
law O
breaking O
. O

Demonstrations O
are O
particularly O
apt O
to O
degenerate O
into O
criminal O
conduct O
when O
they O
leave O
the O
site O
of O
the O
grievance O
and O
become O
mobile O
. O

Petty O
criminals O
and O
street O
people O
looking O
for O
excitement O
attach O
themselves O
like O
remora O
to O
the O
fringes O
of O
the O
crowd O
and O
use O
the O
protest O
as O
an O
excuse O
for O
rock O
throwing O
, O
auto O
trashing O
, O
arson O
, O
window O
breaking O
, O
looting O
, O
pocket O
picking O
and O
general O
hooliganism O
. O

Soon O
the O
whole O
purpose O
of O
the O
demonstration O
is O
lost O
in O
mob O
mania O
. O

There O
are O
better O
ways O
to O
promote O
a O
cause O
. O

Where O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
is O
the O
centerpiece O
, O
rather O
than O
a O
lawful O
demonstration O
that O
may O
only O
attract O
crime O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
justify O
. O

Some O
find O
no O
harm O
in O
the O
misdemeanors O
of O
trespass O
, O
minor O
property O
destruction O
, O
blocking O
traffic O
and O
the O
like O
. O

They O
say O
these O
are O
small O
prices O
to O
pay O
for O
galvanizing O
action O
for O
the O
all O
- O
important O
cause O
. O

The O
crimes O
may O
appear O
small O
, O
but O
the O
prices O
can O
be O
huge O
. O

Here O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
cases O
to O
illustrate O
. O

Assume O
a O
neighborhood O
demonstration O
to O
protest O
speeding O
on O
a O
certain O
road O
or O
a O
careless O
accident O
involving O
a O
police O
car O
. O

The O
protesters O
lie O
down O
in O
the O
street O
, O
blocking O
traffic O
, O
and O
will O
not O
move O
until O
the O
authorities O
carry O
them O
away O
. O

Assume O
that O
someone O
caught O
in O
the O
jam O
has O
a O
heart O
attack O
. O

There O
is O
no O
way O
to O
get O
an O
ambulance O
in O
quickly O
to O
move O
him O
to O
a O
hospital O
. O

He O
dies O
. O

The O
demonstration O
was O
non-violent O
and O
involved O
only O
a O
simple O
misdemeanor O
, O
but O
its O
impact O
on O
that O
individual O
was O
violent O
and O
terminal O
. O

Assume O
that O
a O
TV O
network O
is O
airing O
a O
celebrity O
interview O
program O
with O
a O
live O
audience O
. O

The O
politician O
appearing O
is O
highly O
controversial O
and O
has O
recently O
generated O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
rancor O
amid O
certain O
groups O
. O

In O
a O
planned O
protest O
against O
his O
appearance O
, O
several O
members O
of O
the O
studio O
audience O
chain O
themselves O
in O
front O
of O
the O
TV O
cameras O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
the O
program O
can O
not O
continue O
. O

The O
network O
must O
refund O
money O
to O
the O
advertisers O
and O
loses O
considerable O
revenue O
and O
prestige O
. O

The O
demonstrators O
have O
been O
non-violent O
, O
but O
the O
result O
of O
their O
trespasses O
has O
been O
to O
seriously O
impair O
the O
rights O
of O
others O
unconnected O
with O
their O
dispute O
. O

It O
might O
be O
alleged O
that O
TV O
has O
done O
more O
than O
its O
share O
to O
popularize O
and O
promote O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
, O
so O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
situation O
hypothesized O
above O
would O
be O
simply O
a O
case O
of O
`` O
chickens O
coming O
home O
to O
roost O
. O
'' O

Or O
maybe O
the O
TV O
network O
would O
lose O
nothing O
. O

Geraldo B-PERSON
or O
Phil B-PERSON
would O
probably O
pull O
up O
another O
camera O
and O
interview O
the O
chained O
protesters O
. O

Let O
us O
look O
for O
a O
moment O
at O
another O
type O
of O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
that O
only O
harms O
other O
people O
indirectly O
, O
yet O
does O
irreparable O
damage O
to O
the O
nation O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

I O
am O
referring O
to O
those O
young O
men O
who O
chose O
to O
disobey O
their O
country O
's O
call O
to O
arms O
during O
the B-EVENT
Vietnam I-EVENT
war I-EVENT
and O
fled O
to O
Canada B-GPE
or O
some O
other O
sanctuary O
to O
avoid O
combat O
. O

Their O
cowardly O
acts O
of O
civil O
disobedience O
, O
which O
they O
tried O
to O
hide O
under O
the O
cloak O
of O
outrage O
at O
a O
war O
they O
characterized O
as O
`` O
immoral O
, O
'' O
weakened O
the O
national O
fabric O
and O
threw O
additional O
burdens O
on O
those O
who O
served O
honorably O
in O
that O
conflict O
. O

Even O
more O
at O
fault O
are O
those O
leaders O
in O
and O
out O
of O
government O
who O
urged O
and O
supported O
their O
defections O
, O
thereby O
giving O
great O
help O
and O
comfort O
to O
the O
enemy O
propagandists O
. O

It O
is O
amazing O
that O
the O
ensuing O
mass O
executions O
in O
Vietnam B-GPE
and O
Cambodia B-GPE
do O
not O
weight O
more O
heavily O
on O
minds O
so O
morally O
fine O
- O
tuned O
. O

Worse O
, O
it O
remained O
to O
a O
well O
- O
meaning O
but O
naive O
president O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
to O
administer O
the O
final O
infamy O
upon O
those O
who O
fought O
and O
died O
in O
Vietnam B-GPE
. O

Under O
the O
guise O
of O
`` O
healing O
the O
wounds O
of O
the O
nation O
, O
'' O
President O
Carter B-PERSON
pardoned O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
draft O
evaders O
, O
thus O
giving O
dignity O
to O
their O
allegations O
of O
the O
war O
's O
`` O
immorality O
. O
'' O

The O
precedent O
having O
been O
set O
, O
who O
can O
complain O
if O
future O
generations O
called O
upon O
to O
defend O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
yield O
to O
the O
temptation O
to O
avoid O
the O
danger O
of O
combat O
by O
simply O
declaring O
the O
war O
immoral O
and O
hiding O
until O
it O
is O
over O
? O

Finally O
, O
I O
think O
it O
important O
to O
point O
out O
the O
extraordinarily O
high O
visibility O
of O
non-violent O
civil O
disobedience O
in O
these B-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
intensive O
media O
coverage O
. O

Give O
television O
a O
chance O
to O
cover O
live O
any O
breaking O
of O
the O
law O
, O
and O
no O
second B-ORDINAL
invitation O
will O
be O
required O
. O

This O
brings O
into O
question O
the O
motives O
of O
those O
who O
lead O
civil O
disobedience O
demonstrations O
. O

Do O
they O
want O
the O
spotlight O
for O
themselves O

Here O
is O
a O
good O
rule O
of O
thumb O
: O
If O
the O
movement O
produced O
the O
leader O
, O
the O
chance O
that O
he O
is O
sincere O
is O
much O
greater O
than O
if O
the O
leader O
produced O
the O
movement O
. O

In O
either O
case O
, O
ask O
yourself O
whether O
you O
have O
become O
better O
informed O
on O
the O
issues O
under O
protest O
by O
watching O
the O
act O
of O
civil O
disobedience O
. O

If O
you O
have O
not O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
a O
thorough O
airing O
of O
the O
dispute O
by O
calm O
and O
rational O
debate O
would O
have O
been O
the O
better O

the O

final O

belongs O

sovereignty O

in O
a O
democratic O

Sovereignty O
is O
not O
simply O
a O
quality O

it O
has O
to O
do O
with O
the O
power O

imagine O
a O

no O

We O
knew O
that O
we O
were O
in O
a O
country O
, O
which O
is O
culturally O
sensitive O
. O

From O
day B-DATE
one I-DATE
we O
went O
beefless O
and O
porkless O
, O
so O
we O
could O
look O
after O
the O
sentiments O
of O
both O
the O
Hindus B-NORP
and O
the O
Muslims B-NORP
. O

From O
day B-DATE
one I-DATE
we O
knew O
that O
there O
was O
an O
issue O
about O
vegetarianism O
. O

We O
had O
to O
be O
very O
conscious O
about O
it O
and O
we O
did O
a O
segregation O
in O
our O
kitchens O
, O
which O
has O
been O
unheard O
of O
. O

And O
the O
strategy O
has O
been O
a O
popular O
one O
for O
McDonalds B-ORG
, O
as O
a O
sample O
poll O
of O
lunchtime O
customers O
outside O
a O

in O
South B-GPE
Delhi I-GPE
shows O
. O

We O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
variety O
here O
and O
it O
's O
very O
tasty O
also O
. O

If O
they O
offered O
you O
only O
, O
say O
, O
a O
fully O
western O
menu O
, O
would O
it O
still O
appeal O
to O
you O
? O

No O
, O
no O
that O
's O
not O
good O
. O

I O
think O
it O
should O
be O
both O
, O
the O
Western B-NORP
and O
the O
Indian B-NORP
, O
both O
. O

The O
food O
here O
offered O
is O
a O
lot O
better O
than O
what O
you O
find O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

In O
what O
ways O
? O

Here O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
's O
like O
it O
's O
American B-NORP
and O
as O
well O
as O
Indian B-NORP
taste O
. O

It O
's O
a O
very O
wise O
move O
on O
for O
them O
because O
if O
they O
would O
have O
only O
just O
original O
McDonalds B-ORG
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
would O
have O
done O
so O
great O
. O

I O
think O
by O
blending O
things O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
have O
done O
a O
very O
wise O
move O
. O

Along O
the O
narrow O
crowded O
streets O
of O
old O
Delhi B-GPE
, O
is O
where O
you O
can O
find O
fast O

, O
Indian B-NORP
style O
. O

These O
are O
roadside O

often O
called O

up O
recipes O
of O

and O
stuffed O
puries O
, O
deep O

This O
traditional O
and O
cheap O
fare O
has O
proved O
stiff O
competition O
for O
the O
multinational O
fast O
food O
chains O
, O
but O
they O
've O
been O
fighting O
hard O
and O
maybe O
closing O
in O
. O

Pizza O

Dominos B-ORG

after O

The O
simple O
idea O
of O

is O
also O
rather O
new O
to O
India B-GPE

seems O
to O

Dominos B-ORG

says O
, O
the O
secret O
of O
their O
success O
is O
to O
introduce O
Western B-NORP

an O

twist O

If O

who O
failed O
and O
if O
you O
put O
this O

have O
they O
given O
a O

the O
answer O
most O
of O
the O
time O
will O
be O
no O

They O
have O
decided O
the O
menu O
. O

India B-GPE
is O
a O
deeply O
religious O

traditional O
country O
, O
but O
in O
the O
past O

thanks O
to O

the O

despite O
the O

there O
is O
still O
a O
reluctance O

the O

As O
a O

we O
do O

what O

We O

this O

The O

suggests O
a O
number O

scenarios O
for O

of O

In O

China B-GPE
had O
a O
record O

The O
other O
scenario O
assumes O
that O
Beijing B-GPE
takes O
effective O
actions O
to O
curb O

in O
the B-DATE
coming I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

In O
this O
case O

China B-GPE
would O

with O
a O
current O

account O
deficit O
of O
$ B-MONEY
8.7 I-MONEY

If O
China B-GPE
were O
still O
on O
good O

with O

it O
might O
be O
able O
to O
stem O
the O

using O
some O

. O

But O
since O
June B-DATE
, O
foreign O
bankers O
led O
by O

institutions O
have O
virtually O
suspended O
their O

Even O
if O
borrowing O
resumes O
, O
commercial O
bankers O
are O

expected O

before O
. O

In O

, O
economists O
are O
forecasting O
a O

in O

become O

On O

With O
less O
capital O

The O
Western O
government O
report O

scenario O
assumes O

But O
in O
either O

A O
moment O
ago O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
experience O
of O
our O
reporter O
, O
I O
was O
thinking O
that O
if O
now O
I O
was O
the O
family O
member O
of O
a O
sufferer O
and O
the O
sufferer O
's O
symptoms O
were O
also O
very O
critical O
, O
for O
example O
, O
something O
like O
heart O
disease O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
kind O
of O
illness O
where O
you O
are O
racing O
against O
the O
clock O
, O
well O
, O
the O
process O
of O
waiting O
for O
that O
voice O
prompt O
would O
definitely O
be O
too O
tortuous O
. O

Seeing O
that O
just O
now O
, O
my O
first O
reaction O
was O
that O
it O
was O
extremely O
irresponsible O
. O

And O
why O
. O

The B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Health I-ORG
asked O
that O
health O
care O
organizations O
focus O
on O
the O
patient O
. O

This O
set O
up O
is O
completely O
centered O
on O
itself O
. O

It O
is O
extremely O
indifferent O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
is O
unable O
to O
guarantee O
emergency O
treatment O
. O

So O
, O
among O
the O
advanced O
emergency O
systems O
of O
this O
kind O
that O
you O
have O
had O
contact O
with O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
is O
the O
most O
suitable O
model O
. O

The O
establishment O
of O
a O
consolidated O
emergency O
center O
. O

I O
see O
. O

This O
emergency O
center O
, O
when O
we O
dial O
its O
telephone O
number O
, O
it O
is O
immediately O
able O
to O
display O
our O
location O
. O

It O
has O
a O
regulation O
and O
control O
system O
and O
as O
well O
it O
has O
established O
many O
branch O
centers O
, O
or O
emergency O
stations O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Then O
, O
eh O
, O
immediately O
, O
based O
on O
the O
principle O
of O
proximity O
, O
it O
assigns O
corresponding O
emergency O
personnel O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
relevant O
treatment O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

We O
became O
aware O
, O
eh O
, O
that O
local O
healthcare O
administration O
departments O
were O
still O
some O
biased O
toward O
the O
understanding O
that O
only O
one O
emergency O
center O
can O
be O
established O
in O
a O
district O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

One O
emergency O
center O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
there O
is O
only O
one O
emergency O
station O
. O

Under O
an O
emergency O
center O
, O
there O
can O
be O
branch O
centers O
and O
emergency O
stations O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
principle O
of O
emergency O
care O
is O
rapidity O
, O
proximity O
and O
capability O
. O

That O
is O
also O
to O
say O
, O
that O
a O
facility O
only O
needs O
to O
have O
emergency O
treatment O
capabilities O
, O
then O
following O
examination O
and O
approval O
by O
the O
health O
administration O
, O
it O
can O
become O
an O
emergency O
care O
center O
or O
emergency O
care O
station O
. O


Nothing O
stirred O
the O
soul O
of O
Ronald B-PERSON
Reagan I-PERSON
and O
his O
disciples O
as O
much O
as O
the O
crusade O
to O
aid O
Nicaragua B-GPE
's O
Contra B-NORP
rebels O
, O
or O
the O
dream O
of O
building O
a O
space O
- O
based O
defense O
shield O
to O
knock O
out O
Soviet B-NORP
nuclear O
missiles O
. O

Yet O
under O
Mr. O
Reagan B-PERSON
's O
preferred O
successor O
, O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
, O
those O
two B-CARDINAL
cherished O
national O
- O
security O
causes O
are O
withering O
on O
the O
vine O
. O

And O
, O
surprisingly O
, O
little O
more O
than O
a O
whimper O
of O
protest O
is O
being O
heard O
, O
even O
though O
Reaganauts B-NORP
once O
breathed O
fire O
supporting O
the O
Contras B-NORP
and O
the O
Strategic O
Defense O
Initiative O
. O

`` O
The O

arthritis O
, O
'' O
says O
Rep. O
Henry B-PERSON
Hyde I-PERSON
, O
a O
conservative O
Republican B-NORP
from O
Illinois B-GPE

Yet O
, O
he O
asserts O

`` O
you O

'' O

It O
is O
n't O
surprising O
that O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
n't O
led O
a O
crusade O
to O
pump O
up O
the O
Contras B-NORP
or O
SDI O
. O

Though O
he O
nominally O
supports O
both O
programs O
, O
Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
n't O
been O
a O
passionate O
champion O
of O
either O
cause O
, O
as O
Mr. O
Reagan B-PERSON
was O
. O

What O
's O
surprising O
is O
that O
there O
is O
n't O
more O
of O
a O
conservative O
outcry O
as O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
lets O
the O
programs O
slip O
down O
the O
national O
- O
priority O
list O
. O

A O
combination O
of O
factors O
-- O
a O
weariness O
among O
some O
conservatives O
, O
a O
decline O
in O
the O
perception O
of O
a O
Soviet B-NORP
threat O
and O
a O
preoccupation O
with O
other O
issues O
-- O
seem O
to O
explain O
the O
strange O
tranquility O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
though O
, O
conservative O
Republicans B-NORP
who O
have O
championed O
both O
the O
Contras B-NORP
and O
SDI O
are O
reluctant O
to O
attack O
a O
Republican B-NORP
president O
for O
failing O
to O
do O
more O
-- O
though O
that O
reluctance O
may O
be O
receding O
. O

`` O
We O
want O
to O
complain O

we O
want O
to O
say O
something O
about O

we O

going O
to O
as O
it O
gets O
worse O

'' O
says O
Rep. O
Dan B-PERSON
Burton I-PERSON
, O
an O
Indiana B-GPE

has O
been O
a O
staunch O
Contra B-NORP

`` O

'' O

Mr. O
Burton B-PERSON
says O
conservatives O
' O
unhappiness O
with O
Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
's O
cautious O
handling O
of O
the O
recent O
unsuccessful O
coup O
in O
Panama B-GPE
will O
make O
them O
more O
willing O

speak O
out O

Of O
course O
, O
neither O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
nor O
the O
Congress B-ORG
has O
actually O
abandoned O
the O
Contras B-NORP
or O
SDI O
. O

Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
struck O
a O
deal O
with O
congressional O
leaders O
to O
provide O
nonlethal O
aid O
to O
the O
Contras B-NORP
until O
Nicaragua B-GPE
holds O
national O
elections O
next B-DATE
February I-DATE
. O

But O
the O
administration O
has O
dropped O
any O
effort O
to O
win O
military O
aid O
for O
the O
rebels O
. O

And O
the O
administration O
's O
deal O
with O
Congress B-ORG
gives O
several O
congressional O
committees O
the O
right O
to O
cut O

, O
though O
the O

are O
likely O

Most O
analysts O
think O
there O

little O
prospect O
the O
Contras B-NORP
can O
be O
a O
significant O
fighting O

U.S. B-GPE

after O
the O
February B-DATE
election O
their O
future O
in O
any O

will O
be O
murky O
at O
best O
. O

Instead O
of O
focusing O
on O
the O
Contras B-NORP
, O
Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
switched O
to O
urging O
members O
of O
Congress B-ORG
-- O
most O
recently O
in O
a O
White B-ORG

meeting O
yesterday B-DATE

campaign O
of O
political O
opponents O
of O
Nicaragua B-GPE

Sandinista B-NORP
government O
. O

The O
administration O
continues O
to O
support O
SDI O

or O
Star O

, O
and O
it O
recently O
lobbied O
to O
persuade O
the O
Senate B-ORG

restore O
some O

the O

And O
just B-DATE
last I-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
Defense B-ORG
Secretary O
Dick B-PERSON
Cheney I-PERSON
gave O
a O
strong O
speech O
listing O
`` O
compelling O
reasons O

saying O
he O

to O
veto O
a O

bill O
with O
`` O
inadequate O
'' O
funding O

the O

But O
the O
strong O
pitch O
by O
Mr. O
Cheney B-PERSON
may O
be O
too O
little O
too O
late O
to O
prevent O
damage O
to O
SDI O

The O

And O
while O
the O

speaking O
out O

President O

himself O
has O

launched O
any O

acknowledges O
that O

pursuing O
Mr. O

original O
vision O
of O
an O
`` O
impenetrable O

'' O
protecting O
the O
whole O
U.S. B-GPE
, O
but O
rather O
a O
more O
modest O
version O
. O

More O
ominous O
to O
SDI O
supporters O
, O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
appears O
to O
have O
tacitly O
accepted O
a O
new O
arms O

proposal O
from O
the B-GPE
Soviet I-GPE
Union I-GPE
that O
spells O
long O
- O
term O
trouble O
for O
Star O

The O
Soviets B-NORP
have O
agreed O
to O
complete O
a O
treaty O
cutting O
strategic O

without O
including O
restrictions O
on O

But O
the O

reserve O
the O
right O

withdraw O

the O
completed O
strategic O

treaty O
later O

the O

think O
violates O
the O
existing O
anti-ballistic B-LAW

It O
will O
be O
hard O
down O

persuade O
Congress B-ORG

approve O
money O

and O
also O
to O
make O
the O
Qatari B-NORP
public O
in O
particular O
and O
the O
Arab B-NORP
public O
in O
general O
understand O
what O
takes O
place O
in O
a O
democratic O
atmosphere O
.. O

In O
Qatar B-GPE
there O
are O
many O
independent O
universities O
, O
both O
Arab B-NORP
and O
international O
, O
and O
there O
are O
branches O
of O
well O
established O
international O
universities O
. O

The O
invitation O
was O
from O
the O
Doha B-ORG
Debates I-ORG
program O
.. O

This O
is O
a O
program O
that O
gathers O
together O
many O
intellectuals O
, O
scientists O
, O
heads O
of O
state O
, O
and O
others O
to O
discuss O
numerous O
topics O
with O
complete O
transparency O
and O
democracy O
.. O

I O
was O
hoping O
that O
the O
Doha B-ORG
Debates I-ORG
program O
would O
invite O
Prince O
Sultan B-PERSON
to O
ask O
him O
about O
the O
weapons O
deal O
or O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Walid I-PERSON
bin I-PERSON
Talal I-PERSON
to O
ask O
him O
about O
waste O
and O
the O
launching O
of O
the O
songs O
channels O
, O
or O
Luluah B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Faisal I-PERSON
and O
her O
future O
ambitions O
.. O

Claiming O
power O
by O
being O
silent O
is O
something O
shameful O
for O
some O
countries O
as O
is O
deluding O
the O
people O
with O
their O
silence O
into O
thinking O
that O
they O
are O
powerful O
while O
in O
fact O
they O
are O
hiding O
their O
weakness O
. O

I O
think O
that O
dialogue O
is O
neither O
a O
shame O
nor O
should O
it O
be O
rejected O
.. O

You O
talk O
to O
your O
enemy O
and O
discuss O
with O
him O
.. O

But O
the O
closed O
door O
policy O
.. O
this O
is O
a O
disaster O
for O
the O
people O
and O
a O
pretense O
that O
you O
are O
brave O
through O
a O
lying O
and O
trumpeting O
media O
while O
in O
the O
end O
you O
fail O
in O
the O
least O
confrontation O
.. O

Back O
to O
the O
main O
issue O
.. O
we O
say O
who O
is O
Peres B-PERSON
? O

No O
one O
denies O
that O
Peres B-PERSON
is O
a O
criminal O
. O

But O
who O
is O
Peres B-PERSON
? O

Peres B-PERSON
received O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Nobel I-WORK_OF_ART
Peace I-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
in O
1994 B-DATE
. O

He O
shared O
the O
prize O
with O
both O
Yasser B-PERSON
Arafat I-PERSON
and O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
Prime O
Minister O
at O
that O
time O
, O
Yitzhak B-PERSON
Rabin I-PERSON
. O

Peres B-PERSON
has O
a O
special O
interest O
in O
precision O
electronics O
. O

In O
1997 B-DATE
, O
he O
established O
the B-ORG
" I-ORG
Peres I-ORG
Center I-ORG
for I-ORG
Peace I-ORG
. O
" O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
man O
is O
looking O
for O
more O
peace O
than O
war O
. O

There O
is O
a O
difference O
between O
holding O
discussions O
with O
a O
man O
of O
peace O
and O
holding O
discussions O
with O
a O
man O
looking O
for O
war O
.. O

Peres B-PERSON
is O
also O
a O
man O
who O
received O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Nobel I-WORK_OF_ART
Peace I-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
jointly O
with O
Arafat B-PERSON
.. O

Peres B-PERSON
spent O
money O
establishing O
the B-ORG
Peres I-ORG
Center I-ORG
for I-ORG
Peace I-ORG
while O
Yasser B-PERSON
Arafat I-PERSON
spent O
money O
on O
his O
wife O
. O

We O
have O
n't O
heard O
that O
he O
established O
any O
organization O
to O
support O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
people O
with O
that O
money O
.. O

When O
he O
took O
office O
as O
Prime O
Minister O
Peres B-PERSON
concluded O
successful O
transactions O
to O
acquire O
weapons O
. O

He O
also O
sought O
to O
establish O
a O
deterrent O
nuclear O
program O
since O
Israel B-GPE
owns O
the O
biggest O
nuclear O
arsenal O
in O
the O
world O
. O

All O
this O
was O
during O
his O
tenure O
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
man O
thinks O
and O
plans O
. O

This O
is O
due O
to O
his O
knowledge O
and O
studies O
in O
his O
field O
of O
electronics O
.. O

Again O
we O
say O
that O
knowledge O
is O
a O
powerful O
weapon O
for O
any O
national O
progress O
.. O

Peres B-PERSON
attained O
this O
as O
a O
result O
of O
.. O
knowledge O
and O
proficiency O
.. O
in O
his O
personality O
, O
which O
helped O
give O
him O
an O
edge O
in O
confronting O
any O
situation O
by O
putting O
him O
in O
a O
position O
of O
strength O
, O
and O
not O
weakness O
.. O

Conversely O
, O
we O
see O
the O
squandering O
of O
money O
on O
the O
other O
side O
for O
trivial O
things O
that O
do O
not O
serve O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
cause O
and O
do O
not O
serve O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
and O
the O
Muslims B-NORP
. O

We O
find O
numerous O
satellite O
channels O
financed O
by O
Islamic B-NORP
countries O
, O
and O
we O
also O
find O
numerous O
princes O
and O
kings O
and O
presidents O
who O
spend O
large O
amounts O
of O
money O
on O
their O
vacations O
. O

We O
also O
find O
that O
most O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
people O
and O
some O
Gulf B-LOC
people O
live O
below O
the O
poverty O
line O
.. O

Furthermore O
, O
most O
of O
the O
presidents O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
and O
Gulf B-LOC
states O
do O
not O
have O
any O
high O
scientific O
degree O
or O
any O
sound O
plan O
to O
build O
a O
strong O
country O
at O
the O
scientific O
level O
.. O

They O
do O
not O
even O
have O
any O
interest O
in O
education O
or O
in O
establishing O
strong O
universities O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
except O
for O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

Back O
to O
our O
topic O
. O

Some O
of O
those O
who O
posted O
pictures O
in O
the O
forum O
did O
not O
mention O
the O
topic O
and O
did O
not O
refer O
to O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
visit O
. O

They O
just O
posted O
the O
pictures O
and O
commented O
on O
the O
topic O
from O
their O
imagination O
.. O

His O
Highness O
the O
Prince O
receives O
the O
man O
of O
peace O
in O
Israel B-GPE
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
bring O
Hamas B-ORG
and O
Israel B-GPE
together O
. O

All O
this O
in O
consultation O
with O
Hamas B-ORG
in O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Palestine B-GPE
so O
as O
to O
bring O
views O
closer O
.. O

I O
think O
that O
this O
approach O
of O
holding O
a O
meeting O
between O
Peres B-PERSON
and O
Hamas B-ORG
without O
preliminary O
agreement O
by O
the O
leaders O
of O
Hamas B-ORG
basically O
holds O
no O
benefit O
for O

Peres B-PERSON
admitted O
that O
his O
country O
lost O
the O
last O
war O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

He O
said O
that O
this O
war O
was O
a O
loss O
for O
Israel B-GPE
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
many O
politicians O
. O

In O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
every O
war O
is O
a O
loss O
because O
peace O
is O
the O
best O
option O
and O
is O
required O
in O
the O
coming O
period O
for O
all O

In O
a O

he O

Israel B-GPE
tried O
to O
defend O
itself O
in O
the O
war O
which O
it O
launched O
against O

. O

He O
said O
that O
Israel B-GPE
did O
not O
have O
any O
ambitions O
there O
, O
and O
its O
aim O
was O
to O

He O

on O
Israel B-GPE

a O
grave O

he O
stressed O

these O
opinions O

He O
said O
that O
Israel B-GPE
does O
not O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
Iran B-GPE
but O
they O
are O
against O

of O
his O
desire O

Peres B-PERSON
admitted O
his O

full O
peace O

Without O

how O

you O

How O

that O

Peres B-PERSON
's O
visit O
to O
the O
students O
' O

so O
they O
could O
talk O
to O
him O
-LRB- O
as O
a O
man O

peace O
-RRB- O
and O
not O
as O
a O
Jew B-NORP
or O
a O

criminal O
.. O
that O
is O
something O
normal O
for O
any O
visiting O
official O
to O
be O
received O
by O
university O
officials O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
picture O
is O
normal O
. O

Discussion O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
- O
Israeli B-NORP
situation O
by O
the O
students O
in O
a O
unique O
democratic O
oasis O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

All O
sides O
are O
there O
.. O
debating O
, O
discussing O
, O
arguing O
in O
a O
democratic O
atmosphere O
difficult O
to O
see O
in O
any O
country O
.. O

I O
think O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
that O
if O
democracy O
in O
some O
of O
the O
neighboring O
countries O
is O
non-existent O
in O
the O
simplest O
matters O
related O
to O
their O
personal O
rights O
and O
the O
demand O
for O
them O
. O
Then O
how O
could O
they O
reach O
to O
the O
level O
of O
Qatar B-GPE
in O
gathering O
this O
huge O
number O
of O
intellectuals O
, O
politicians O
, O
and O
heads O
of O
state O
to O
discuss O
sensitive O
issues O
that O
concern O
the O
Arab B-NORP
World O
? O

After O
Qatar B-GPE
went O
beyond O
local O
democracy O
and O
human O
rights O
in O
the O
country O
.. O
praise O
God O
and O
many O
thanks O
to O
His O
Highness O
Sheikh O
Hamad B-PERSON
bin I-PERSON
Khalifa I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Thani I-PERSON
, O
who O
established O
democracy O
and O
freedom O
in O
the O
country O
.. O
and O
made O
Qatar B-GPE
a O
platform O
for O
dialogue O
.. O
so O
the O
discussion O
took O
place O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

There O
was O
disagreement O
and O
agreement O
, O
and O
that O
is O
something O
normal O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
present O
atmosphere O
.. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
we O
find O
different O
meetings O
without O
any O
outcome O
because O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
democratic O
basis O
for O
dialogue O
. O

All O
that O
results O
from O
not O
accepting O
various O
opinions O
. O

Conversely O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
lack O
of O
freedom O
among O
the O
Arab B-NORP
people O
we O
find O
that O
it O
is O
America B-GPE
which O
is O
in O
the O
driver O
's O
seat O
and O
steers O
guests O
wherever O
it O
wants O
and O
takes O
them O
on O
tours O
without O
any O
questioning O
directed O
at O
it O
. O

All O
this O
marginalizes O
the O
Arab B-NORP
individual O
as O
though O
he O
had O
no O
-LRB- O
mind O
-RRB- O
or O
-LRB- O
opinion O
-RRB- O
, O
and O
you O
find O
that O
the O
areas O
he O
is O
allowed O
to O
talk O
about O
are O
women O
driving O
in O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
and O
similar O
useless O
topics O
.. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
explain O
something O
to O
the O
brothers O
: O
Peres B-PERSON
's O
visit O
is O
an O
internal O
Qatari B-NORP
affair O
. O

It O
was O
announced O
in O
the O
newspapers O
that O
Peres B-PERSON
would O
visit O
Qatar B-GPE
, O
and O
it O
was O
announced O
in O
the O
three B-CARDINAL
Qatari B-NORP
newspapers O
. O

There O
are O
writers O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
who O
have O
positive O
opinions O
as O
well O
as O
negative O
opinions O
. O

This O
difference O
is O
good O
and O
something O
through O
which O
nations O
and O
people O
progress O
. O

That O
is O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
forum O
. O

While O
he O
was O
leaving O
the O
hall O
, O
a O
student O
addressed O
Shimon B-PERSON
Peres I-PERSON
with O
the O
word O
" O
terrorist O
" O
.. O
" O
terrorist O
" O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE
, O
which O
caused O
the O
accompanying O
Qatari B-NORP
security O
to O
intervene O
to O
prevent O
him O
from O
continuing O
. O

But O
the O
question O
now O
is O
: O
Who O
is O
better O
.. O
Peres B-PERSON
or O
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
? O

How O
many O
did O
Peres B-PERSON
kill O
and O
how O
many O
did O
Bush B-PERSON
kill O
? O

There O
are O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
three I-CARDINAL
defects O
in O
this O
exposition O
of O
yours O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
- O
lack O
of O
vision O
: O

You O
describe O
the O
contemporary O
Qatari B-NORP
situation O
as O
just O
a O
legitimate O
quest O
for O
scientific O
and O
technological O
superiority O
.. O

If O
we O
could O
agree O
that O
we O
fall O
behind O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
and O
Americans B-NORP
in O
such O
fields O
... O
however O
the O
problem O
lies O
in O
ignoring O
all O
this O
clear O
evidence O
that O
the O
scientific O
project O
is O
nothing O
but O
a O
small O
misleading O
part O
of O
a O
campaign O
meant O
to O
change O
the O
Islamic B-NORP
Gulf B-LOC
and O
Qatari B-NORP
identity O
and O
to O
remove O
its O
established O
fixed O
principles O
in O
which O
they O
surpass O
everything O
that O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
and O
the O
Americans B-NORP
have O
. O

How O
can O
you O
reconcile O
the O
will O
of O
scientific O
and O
technological O
progress O
.. O
and O
hosting O
the B-EVENT
Asian I-EVENT
Olympics I-EVENT
or O
a O
military O
base O
or O
a O
Zionist B-NORP
politician O
or O
a O
program O
like O
the B-ORG
Doha I-ORG
Debates I-ORG
? O

So O
... O
the O
purely O
scientific O
and O
technological O
side O
can O
not O
justify O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
. O

***** O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
contradiction O
of O
principle O
and O
the O
dominance O
of O
worldly O
interests O
. O

In O
your O
article O
here O
, O
you O
justified O
the O
legitimacy O
of O
hosting O
Peres B-PERSON
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
exchanging O
opinions O
, O
dialogue O
, O
and O
using O
intellect O
... O

Would O
you O
have O
held O
the O
same O
position O
if O
a O
terrorist O
or O
a O
well O
- O
known O
criminal O
were O
hosted O
under O
the O
slogan O
of O
, O
the O
language O
of O
reason O
, O
friendly O
media O
dialogue O
, O
and O
openness O
to O
the O
other O
?... O

Would O
you O
accept O
it O
if O
your O
neighbor O
hosted O
someone O
who O
had O
attacked O
you O
?? O

So O
... O
there O
are O
principles O
that O
must O
be O
adhered O
to O
.. O

The O
most O
important O
of O
them O
is O
supporting O
the O
truth O
and O
loyalty O
to O
Muslims B-NORP
even O
if O
it O
goes O
against O
narrow O
personal O
interests O
... O
and O
the O
relationship O
of O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
with O
the O
Americans B-NORP
... O

Despite O
my O
being O
convinced O
that O
it O
should O
be O
limited O
after O
the O
latter O
's O
aggression O
, O
it O
does O
not O
in O
any O
way O
reach O
the O
level O
of O
the O
relationship O
of O
Qatar B-GPE
with O
the O
Americans B-NORP
themselves O
. O

-LRB- O
The O
tension O
in O
the O
relations O
with O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
recently O
and O
the O
military O
base O
on O
the O
Qatari B-NORP
territory O
despite O
the O
state O
of O
peace O
in O
the O
region O
are O
evidence O
of O
that O
-RRB- O
... O

So O
how O
come O
Qatar B-GPE
is O
now O
adding O
to O
this O
with O
intimate O
relations O
with O
those O
whose O
existence O
and O
history O
and O
reality O
are O
entirely O
connected O
to O
aggression O
against O
Muslims B-NORP
.. O
namely O
the O
Zionists B-NORP
!!? O

A O
mistake O
can O
not O
be O
justified O
by O
committing O
a O
bigger O
mistake O
or O
proceeding O
further O
in O
it O
!! O
. O

**** O

Thirdly B-ORDINAL
, O
going O
overboard O
with O
freedom O
: O

There O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
mania O
in O
the O
field O
of O
freedom O
that O
makes O
many O
people O
think O
that O
every O
freedom O
is O
commendable O
.. O
While O
giving O
free O
rein O
to O
freedom O
is O
a O
recipe O
for O
chaos O
and O
corruption O
.. O
even O
in O
the O
field O
of O
speech O
or O
science O
... O

For O
example O
, O
there O
is O
no O
room O
for O
freedom O
in O
talking O
about O
God O
and O
His O
Prophet B-PERSON
and O
His O
verses O
since O
it O
comes O
in O
the O
context O
of O
what O
brought O
the O
disbelievers O
to O
hell O
. O

But O
we O
used O
to O
embark O
boldly O
with O
bold O
talkers O
.. O

There O
is O
no O
room O
for O
leaving O
the O
door O
wide O
open O
for O
discussing O
or O
teaching O
" O
science O
and O
technology O
" O
as O
the O
theory O
of O
development O
.. O
or O
the O
theories O
of O
Darwin B-PERSON
.. O
or O
how O
to O
make O
bombs O
or O
liquor O
.. O
or O
the O
creeds O
of O
polytheism O
or O
excessiveness O
in O
regarding O
others O
as O
unbelievers O
.. O
or O
the O
sciences O
of O
judging O
with O
anything O
other O
than O
the O
revelations O
of O
God O
-LRB- O
except O
by O
the O
way O
of O
warning O
against O
them O
-RRB- O
.. O

So O
... O
imposing O
censorship O
and O
certain O
regulations O
on O
the O
work O
of O
educational O
and O
media O
institutions O
is O
not O
a O
matter O
for O
censure O
or O
a O
sign O
of O
backwardness O
... O
rather O
it O
might O
be O
a O
necessary O
and O
urgent O
requirement O
... O
especially O
if O
those O
in O
charge O
of O
theses O
institutions O
are O
non-Muslims B-NORP
.. O
or O
if O
the O
ones O
exposed O
are O
our O
younger O
generation O
and O
the O
treasures O
of O
our O
nation O
!!. O

You O
might O
even O
be O
filled O
with O
admiration O
of O
the O
contradiction O
in O
attitudes O
when O
you O
see O
the O
" O
supporters O
of O
freedom O
" O
demanding O
the O
imposition O
of O
government O
censorship O
on O
courses O
in O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
memorization O
, O
charitable O
institutions O
, O
and O
the O
pulpits O
in O
some O
of O
our O
countries O
!!!!. O

+++ O

What O
is O
happening O
in O
Qatar B-GPE
is O
a O
political O
and O
intellectual O
penetration O
in O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
region O
in O
every O
meaning O
of O
the O
word O
.. O

The O
danger O
they O
face O
is O
very O
serious O
... O

Of O
course O
, O
those O
who O
want O
to O
penetrate O
us O
will O
not O
declare O
that O
... O

Rather O
, O
they O
will O
hide O
their O
aims O
behind O
sweet O
words O
or O
promises O
of O
providing O
limited O
or O
imaginary O
benefits O
... O

Otherwise O
, O
we O
would O
not O
be O
deceived O
by O
the O
trick O
... O

For O
many O
Muslims B-NORP
today O
their O
priorities O
are O
confused O
... O

So O
they O
weigh O
things O
without O
the O
guidance O
of O
God O
... O

This O
is O
the O
real O
reason O
for O
our O
present O
situation O
.. O
not O
just O
because O
of O
scientific O
or O
technological O
backwardness O
. O

-LRB- O
You O
will O
find O
the O
Jews B-NORP
and O
polytheists O
the O
ones O
most O
hostile O
to O
the O
believers O
-RRB- O
. O

-LRB- O
God O
forbids O
you O
to O
turn O
in O
friendship O
to O
those O
who O
fought O
against O
you O
with O
regard O
to O
your O
religion O
and O
who O
drove O
you O
out O
of O
your O
homes O
and O
who O
helped O
others O
drive O
you O
out O
. O

Those O
who O
turn O
to O
them O
are O
evildoers O
-RRB- O
. O

There O
are O
four B-CARDINAL
types O
of O
men O
: O

The O
man O
who O
knows O
and O
knows O
that O
he O
knows O
. O

He O
is O
a O
scholar O
, O
so O
ask O
him O
. O

The O
man O
who O
knows O
but O
does O
not O
know O
that O
he O
knows O
. O

He O
has O
forgotten O
, O
so O
remind O
him O
... O

The O
man O
who O
does O
not O
know O
and O
knows O
that O
he O
does O
not O
know O
. O

He O
is O
ignorant O
, O
so O
teach O
him O
... O

And O
the O
man O
who O
does O
not O
know O
and O
does O
not O
know O
that O
he O
does O
not O
know O
. O

He O
is O
a O
fool O
so O
reject O
him O

Abu B-PERSON
Karam I-PERSON

I O
am O
a O
programmer O
and O
a O
computer O
systems O
analyst O
.. O

I O
took O
a O
course O
at O
the B-ORG
General I-ORG
Administration I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
in O
the O
field O
of O
computers O
and O
Qatari B-NORP
trainees O
attended O
the O
course O
with O
us O
.. O

What O
happened O
was O
that O
after O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
those O
Qataris B-NORP
disappeared O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
them O
again O
.. O

I O
saw O
them O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
in O
the O
restaurant O
of O
the O
institute O
. O

I O
asked O
them O
" O
I O
hope O
that O
nothing O
bad O
has O
happened O
. O
Where O
have O
you O
been O
? O
you O
have O
n't O
attended O
with O
us O
.. O
" O

They O
said O
,, O
The O
lecturer O
comes O
in O
, O
gives O
the O
lecture O
, O
and O
leaves O
but O
we O
do O
not O
understand O
anything O
even O
though O
he O
is O
an B-NORP
Egyptian I-NORP
Arab I-NORP
.. O

We O
decided O
to O
transfer O
to O
a O
course O
that O
is O
easier O
than O
this O
one O
in O
the O
field O
of O
administration O
. O

The O
director O
of O
admissions O
understood O
our O
situation O
and O
accepted O
the O
transfer O
to O
a O
program O
in O
administration O
. O

So O
why O
should O
we O
go O
back O
to O
Qatar B-GPE
without O
getting O
a O
degree O
? O
" O

But O
you O
, O
al B-PERSON

Wajba I-PERSON
, O
are O
sitting O
here O
philosophizing O
, O
telling O
lies O
, O
and O
saying O
that O
you O
have O
an O
advanced O
educational O
system O
. O

And O
by O
the O
way O
, O
there O
were O
also O
Omanis B-NORP
with O
us O
, O
and O
they O
completed O
the O
course O
normally O
with O
us O
.. O

In O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
, O
the O
course O
was O
in O
the O
C++ B-LANGUAGE
language O
, O
which O
is O
easy O
, O
but O
such O
is O
your O
education O
that O
maybe O
you O
do O
, O
even O
know O
anything O
about O
Access B-PRODUCT
.. O

Anyone O
who O
heard O
you O
would O
say O
that O
you O
went O
into O

or O
that O
you O
had O

do O

say O
he O

you O
are O
excused O

it O

that O

enter O

That O
idea O
of O
the O
Saudi B-NORP
airspace O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
what O
is O
nicer O
than O
that O
is O
playing O
host O
to O
the O
democratic O
enemy O
in O
your O
land O
... O

But O
my O
opinion O
is O
for O
you O
and O
the O
Qataris B-NORP
to O
discuss O
with O
him O
the O
issue O
of O
murdering O
innocent O
children O
and O
usurping O
the O
rights O
of O
others O
. O

Or O
more O
clearly O
, O
you O
should O
ask O
him O
to O
explain O
to O
you O
how O
to O
hate O
your O
neighbors O
and O
maybe O
he O
would O
train O
you O
in O
usurping O
their O
rights O
or O
train O
you O
in O
killing O
and O
shedding O
blood O
... O

The O
phrase O
" O
away O
from O
any O
prejudice O
" O
is O
also O
nice O
. O

Do O
n't O
you O
have O
any O
feelings O
of O
group O
spirit O
, O
my O
friend O
? O

What O
the O
Jews B-NORP
are O
doing O
does O
not O
call O
for O
any O
prejudice O
or O
bias O
. O

I O
believe O
what O
runs O
in O
your O
veins O
is O
not O
blood O
but O
cold O
water O
... O

You O
justify O
this O
visit O
by O
this O
person O
, O
whose O
hands O
are O
stained O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
the O
Muslims B-NORP
, O
and O
you O
criticize O
the O
weapons O
deals O
. O

This O
is O
normal O
. O

These O
weapons O
are O
for O
defending O
ourselves O
against O
our O
enemy O
whom O
you O
receive O
with O
hugs O
and O
so O
on O
.. O
While O
those O
who O
you O
say O
are O
strong O
are O
strong O
indeed O
, O
but O
not O
with O
Peres B-PERSON
. O

They O
are O
strong O
and O
we O
wo O
n't O
invite O
them O
to O
our O
country O
to O
discuss O
their O
culture O
which O
we O
know O
and O
you O
know O
. O

But O
you O
are O
weak O
, O
weaker O
than O
a O
fly O
. O

Therefore O
you O
are O
feigning O
strength O
with O
the O
descendents O
of O
monkeys O
. O

Why O
should O
we O
go O
that O
far O
? O

Previously O
, O
your O
foreign O
minister O
likened O
your O
small O
country O
to O
Israel B-GPE
. O

What O
a O
bad O
comparison O
and O
what O
it O
was O
compared O
to O
! O

You O
greatly O
admire O
the O
Peres B-PERSON
's O
education O
and O
his O
academic O
degrees O
. O

Who O
else O
other O
than O
you O
would O
admire O
that O
? O

He O
is O
your O
highest O

... O

If O
you O

to O
Islam B-ORG

some O

up O

The O
Japanese B-NORP
retort O
that O

`` O

That O

likely O

the O

say O
, O
no O

how O

the O

This O
anti-Cui O
" O
movement O
" O
made O
me O
think O
of O
the O
past O
. O

When O
I O
was O
in O
junior O
high O
school O
, O
a O
man O
who O
lived O
nearby O
died O
; O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
why O
, O
but O
rumors O
started O
flying O
, O
everybody O
said O
his O
wife O
murdered O
him O
. O

The O
two B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
had O
been O
together O
for O
many B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
at O
the O
time O
their O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
were O
older O
than O
I O
was O
. O

This O
man O
was O
very O
honest O
, O
and O
the O
woman O
had O
always O
been O
very O
sociable O
, O
and O
even O
though O
the O
medical O
examiner O
had O
already O
examined O
the O
body O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
all O
this O
talk O
came O
from O
, O
but O
the O
man O
's O
family O
insisted O
on O
reopening O
the O
casket O
and O
re-examining O
it O
. O

This O
affair O
stirred O
up O
quite O
a O
hubbub O
in O
our O
little O
town O
. O

My O
mom O
, O
too O
, O
just O
kept O
discussing O
it O
on O
and O
on O
. O

To O
my O
mind O
it O
was O
totally O
uninteresting O
, O
I O
just O
felt O
these O
middle O
- O
aged O
women O
were O
extremely O
suspicious O
, O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
see O
what O
all O
the O
fuss O
was O
over O
that O
woman O
. O

Then O
one B-DATE
day I-DATE
my O
mom O
was O
at O
the O
table O
, O
the O
saliva O
spraying O
, O
and O
I O
just O
could O
n't O
stand O
it O
anymore O
. O

Mom O
, O
do O
n't O
keep O
repeating O
what O
other O
people O
say O
, O
OK O
? O

You O
say O
somebody O
killed O
somebody O
; O
what O
proof O
do O
you O
have O
? O

My O
mom O
rapped O
her O
chopsticks O
on O
the O
table O
: O
You O
're O
just O
a O
kid O
, O
what O
do O
you O
know O
? O

There O
are O
no O
waves O
without O
wind O
; O
if O
this O
were O
nothing O
, O
people O
would O
n't O
be O
talking O
about O
it O
so O
much O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
dare O
answer O
the O
old O
lady O
back O
, O
but O
I O
thought O
to O
myself O
: O
Just O
wait O
and O
see O
, O
wait O
until O
this O
woman O
has O
been O
proven O
innocent O
, O
then O
you O
wo O
n't O
have O
anything O
to O
say O
. O

This O
woman O
was O
really O
quite O
a O
character O
; O
not O
only O
was O
she O
on O
good O
terms O
with O
some O
of O
the O
bigwigs O
at O
the O
plant O
, O
she O
was O
also O
quite O
familiar O
with O
the O
head O
of O
the O
city O
's O
public O
security O
bureau O
, O
who O
had O
been O
transferred O
over O
temporarily O
from O
the O
plant O
. O

The O
matter O
of O
whether O
to O
open O
the O
casket O
dragged O
on O
and O
on O
, O
and O
finally O
, O
because O
the O
pressure O
from O
public O
opinion O
was O
so O
great O
, O
they O
re-examined O
the O
body O
, O
and O
the O
result O
was O
poisoning O
. O

When O
that O
came O
out O
, O
everybody O
was O
in O
an O
uproar O
. O

To O
calm O
the O
public O
, O
finally O
there O
was O
a O
trial O
, O
and O
the O
woman O
was O
found O
guilty O
of O
murdering O
her O
husband O
. O

Everybody O
felt O
that O
, O
in O
such O
a O
case O
, O
she O
would O
certainly O
get O
the O
death O
penalty O
, O
but O
she O
was O
given O
a O
stay O
of O
execution O
. O

After O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
the O
head O
of O
the O
city O
's O
public O
security O
bureau O
became O
head O
of O
the O
provincial O
public O
security O
department O
, O
and O
then O
some O
people O
said O
that O
again O
this O
woman O
might O
show O
up O
in O
the O
provincial O
capital O
. O

I O
think O
that O
if O
the O
world O
did O
not O
have O
" O
wretched O
men O
" O
who O
waste O
endless O
time O
tangled O
up O
in O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
like O
Cui O
's O
, O
or O
" O
big O

mouthed O
women O
" O
like O
my O
mother O
, O
people O
like O
them O
, O
who O
I O
feel O
have O
always O
been O
good O
at O
certain O
things O
, O
then O
people O
would O
be O
able O

get O
away O

underestimated O

If O
this O

it O
has O

It O
may O

measures O
to O
increase O
the O

It O
would O

affect O
the O
perceptions O

the O

of O
the B-ORG
Federal I-ORG
Reserve I-ORG

, O
and O
the O
informed O
public O
generally O
, O
as O
to O
what O
constitutes O
a O
reasonable O
degree O
of O
price O
stability O
. O

In O
the B-DATE
early I-DATE
1980s I-DATE
, O
I O
predicted O
a O
significant O
acceleration O
in O
productivity O
growth O
over O
the O
rest O
of O
the B-DATE
decade I-DATE
. O

This O
forecast O
was O
based O
on O
the O
apparent O
reversal O
of O
most O
of O
the O
negative O
forces O
-- O
such O
as O
demographic O
changes O
, O
the O
oil O
shock O
and O
accelerating O
inflation O
-- O
that O
had O
reduced O
productivity O
gains O
in O
the B-DATE
1970s I-DATE
. O

There O
has O
indeed O
been O
more O
than O
a O
one B-CARDINAL
percentage O
point O
improvement O
in O
productivity O
growth O
since O
1981 B-DATE
. O

But O
I O
had O
expected O
more O
, O
which O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
reason O
I O
began O
looking O
at O
evidence O
suggesting O
defects O
in O
the O
official O
output O
estimates O
. O

The O
evidence O
does O
not O
clearly O
support O
the O
view O
that O
the O
downward O
bias O
in O
output O
growth O
has O
become O
greater O
during O
the O
1948 B-DATE
- I-DATE
89 I-DATE
period O
, O
but O
all O
I O
am O
claiming O
is O
that O
the O
growth O
trend O
is O
understated O
. O

-LRB- O
It O
is O
, O
however O
, O
possible O
, O
that O
further O
study O
will O
reveal O
increasing O
bias O
. O
-RRB- O

This O
bias O
is O
in O
no O
way O
deliberate O
. O

The O
understatement O
of O
growth O
is O
due O
largely O
to O
the O
conservative O
expedients O
adopted O
to O
deal O
with O
deficiencies O
in O
basic O
economic O
data O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
of O
three B-CARDINAL
major O
sources O
of O
error O
is O
the O
use O
of O
labor O
input O
estimates O
-LRB- O
mainly O
employment O
or O
hours B-TIME
-RRB- O
instead O
of O
output O
estimates O
for O
those O
sectors O

such O
as O
governments O

household O
services O
and O
private O
non-profit O
institutions O
, O
where O
there O
are O
difficulties O
in O
assembling O
output O
data O
. O

This O
means O
that O
no O
allowance O
is O
made O
for O
possible O
increases O
in O
output O
per O
unit O
of O
labor O
. O

In O
an O
unrelated O
program O
in O
which O
the B-ORG
Labor I-ORG
Department I-ORG
does O
estimate O
output O

for O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL

Even O

no B-CARDINAL

The O

the O

Finally O
, O
the O

understate O

they O
make O

In O

a O

Since O

further O

that O

Gosh O

There O

been O
a O

going O
on O
lately O
, O
ah O
. O

I O
frequently O
go O
to O
court O
. O

Before O
you O
saw O
that O
I O
forgot O
to O
make O
a O
customs O
declaration O
and O
had O
to O
go O
to O

. O

Later O
on O
, O
I O
neglected O
to O

and O
had O
to O
go O
again O

Today O
I O
'll O
go O
in O
a O

, O
yes O
. O

Today O
, O
it O
's O
, O
um O
, O
it O
's O
to O
give O
-- O

Who O
did O
you O
offend O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
offend O
anybody O
. O

I O
was O
selected O
as O
a O
juror O
. O

To O
serve O
on O
a O
jury O
, O
to O
serve O
on O
a O
jury O
. O

Oh O
, O
you O
offended O
the O
accused O
. O

No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
today O
it O
's O
like O
this O
. O

He O
first O
makes O
the O
selection O
, O
then O
the O
lawyers O
for O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
sides O
take O
a O
look O
. O

I O
still O
do O
n't O
know O

I O
will O

He O
still O
does O
n't O
know O
if O
he O
will O
be O

or O
not O
. O

It O
's O
like O
this O
; O
the O
lawyers O
for O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
sides O
have O
to O
look O
to O
see O
how O
the O
person O
is O
. O

Then O
everybody O
makes O
the O
selection O
together O
, O
the O
person O
has O
to O
be O
acceptable O
to O
all O
. O

So O
both O
people O
have O
to O
think O
that O
he O
will O
be O

both O

Beneficial O
to O
one O

Right O

, O
that O

Only O
then O
can O
he O
become O

So O
, O
that O
is O
-- O

Normally O
, O
normally O
they O
will O
do O
their O

not O

people O

us O

ah O
, O
who O
work O

Ah O

Oh O
, O
they O
're O

you O

, O
or O
will O

They O

you O

that O
you O

Ay O
Today O
, O
Wendao B-PERSON
, O
so O
when O
you O
mentioned O

, O
I O
thought O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
controversy O
over O
the O
Qiu B-PERSON
Xinghua I-PERSON
court O
case O
. O

The O
controversy O
, O
eh O
, O
actually O
caused O
me O
to O
feel O
deeply O
that O
we O
have O
to O
admit O
that O
our O
country O
, O
uh O
, O
is O
still O
a O
rather O
backward O
country O
. O

Economically O
, O
we O
are O
already O
very O
, O
very O
strong O
, O
but O
in O
reality O
when O
you O
talk O
about O
whether O
a O
country O
is O
, O
er O
, O
advanced O
or O
not O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
just O
look O
at O
the O
economy O
. O

That O
is O
also O
to O
say O
, O
ah O
, O
you O
would O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
hard O
time O
for O
the O
so O
- O
called O
western O
legal O
provisions O
, O
uh O
, O
to O
work O
here O
, O
ah O
. O

You O
are O
assuming O
that O
western O
legal O
provisions O
are O
advanced O
. O

Um O
. O

And O
our O
, O
eh O
, O
law O
, O
socialism O
, O
ah O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
make O
that O
assumption O
. O

My O
that O
-- O

My O
meaning O
is O
that O
we O
are O
all O
moving O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
globalization O
. O

That O
is O
not O
necessarily O
a O
question O
of O
being O
advanced O
or O
backward O
. O

Your O
whole O
-- O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
implement O
many O
of O
our O
, O
uh O
, O
provisions O
. O

Whether O
or O
not O
they O
can O
be O
implemented O
is O
not O
necessarily O

And O
Japan B-GPE

that O

The O
U.S. B-GPE

U.S. B-GPE

was O

as O
a O

approach O

But O
the O
EC B-ORG
reacted O
defiantly O
, O
arguing O
that O
the O

U.S. B-GPE
Deputy O

Jules B-PERSON

replied O
that O
the O
proposal O
was O
entirely O
consistent O
with O
the O
April B-DATE

. O

He O
said O
he O
was O
surprised O
by O
the O
EC B-ORG

reaction O
, O
calling O
it O
`` O
vehement O
, O
even O
frenetic O
. O
'' O

The O
U.S. B-GPE
proposal O
also O
was O
criticized O
by O
food O

importing O

countries O
, O
who O
said O
that O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
made O
no O
special O
allowances O
for O
poor O
nations O
. O

While O
many O
experts O
argue O
that O
food O

importing O
nations O
would O
eventually O
become O
self O
- O
sufficient O
in O
a O
free O
- O
market O
system O
, O
the O
poorest O
nations O
are O
likely O
to O
need O
help O
in O
the O
meantime O
. O

Ambassador O
Katz B-PERSON
said O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
was O
open O
to O
discussing O
particular O
problems O
of O
developing O
countries O
. O

The O
U.S. B-GPE
administration O
said O
its O
plan O
would O
allow O
considerable O
flexibility O
in O
determining O
how O
and O
when O
the O
free O
- O
trade O
goals O
would O
be O
achieved O
. O

The O
U.S. B-GPE
argues O
that O
its O
plan O
would O
ease O
the O
transition O
to O
freer O
agriculture O
trade O
by O
converting O
certain O
non-tariff O
barriers O
into O
tariffs O
that O
, O
together O
with O
existing O
tariffs O
, O
then O
would O
be O
phased O
out O
over O
10 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

But O
the O
EC B-ORG
is O
strongly O
opposed O
to O
converting O
agricultural O
supports O
into O
tariffs O
. O

The O
new O
U.S. B-GPE
package O
also O
says O
countries O
could O
temporarily O
raise O
tariffs O
on O
certain O
products O
if O
they O
experience O
an O
unusually O
heavy O
volume O
of O
imports O
. O

It O
would O
establish O
procedures O
to O
prevent O
countries O
from O
using O
health O
and O
sanitation O
rules O
to O
impede O
trade O
arbitrarily O
. O

Secretary O
Clayton B-PERSON
Yeutter I-PERSON
said O
in O
Washington B-GPE
that O
the O

`` O

US B-GPE
Energy B-ORG
Secretary O
Bill B-PERSON
Richardson I-PERSON
has O
extended O
an O
emergency O
order O
to O
keep O
electricity O
flowing O
to O
California B-GPE
. O

The O
measure O
will O
require O
western O
suppliers O
to O
sell O
power O
to O
the O
state O
for O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
another I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

As O
we O
hear O
from O
Michael B-PERSON
Sullivan I-PERSON
, O
the O
official O
also O
proposed O
an O
energy O
price O
cap O
for O
the O
West B-LOC
, O
but O
the O
suggestion O
had O
a O
mixed O
response O
from O
western O
governors O
. O

The O
extension O
of O
the O
federal O
order O
will O
require O
power O
suppliers O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
to O
keep O
sending O
their O
surplus O
electricity O
to O
California B-GPE
. O

Electrical O
resources O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
Coast I-LOC
state O
are O
stretched O
to O
their O
limit O
with O
a O
looming O
threat O
of O
rolling O
blackouts O
. O

California B-GPE
's O
utility O
companies O
are O
not O
able O
to O
generate O
all O
the O
power O
their O
customers O
need O
, O
so O
they O
have O
turned O
to O
outside O
suppliers O
and O
in O
the O
face O
of O
rising O
prices O
the O
state O
's O
two B-CARDINAL
largest O
utility O
firms O
have O
sunk O
more B-MONEY
than I-MONEY
eight I-MONEY
billion I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
in O
debt O
. O

Suppliers O
outside O
California B-GPE
had O
threatened O
to O
cut O
off O
the O
power O
, O
afraid O
that O
the O
cash O
- O
strapped O
utilities O
were O
not O
able O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
. O

The O
emergency O
order O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
and O
the O
extension O
announced O
in O
Denver B-GPE
at O
a O
meeting O
of O
western O
governors O
will O
keep O
electricity O
flowing O
to O
California B-GPE
through O
the B-DATE
middle I-DATE
of I-DATE
next I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

The O
crisis O
began O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
when O
California B-GPE
imposed O
a O
price O
freeze O
on O
its O
private O
utility O
firms O
to O
protect O
consumers O
while O
the O
state O
deregulates O
its O
energy O
sector O
, O
but O
the O
lifting O
of O
market O
controls O
led O
to O
wild O
price O
fluctuations O
on O
the O
wholesale O
market O
. O

This O
was O
made O
worse O
by O
several O
factors O
. O

No O
new O
generating O
stations O
have O
been O
built O
in O
the O
state O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
some O
existing O
generators O
are O
offline O
for O
repairs O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
California B-GPE
has O
been O
growing O
. O

Energy B-ORG
Secretary O
Bill B-PERSON
Richardson I-PERSON
says O
it O
is O
a O
case O
of O
demand O
outpacing O
supplies O
. O

I O
know O
in O
California B-GPE
alone O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
year I-DATE
electricity O
demand O
has O
increased O
13 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

California B-GPE
's O
wholesale O
electricity O
prices O
, O
which O
had O
been O
capped O
at O
250 B-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
per O
megawatt O
hour O
in O
a O
regulated O
market O
, O
have O
peaked O
under O
deregulation O
at O
1400 B-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
per O
megawatt O
hour O
. O

With O
the O
current O
price O
freeze O
, O
utilities O
have O
been O
prevented O
from O
passing O
along O
the O
increase O
to O
consumers O
. O

Wednesday B-DATE
, O
Energy B-ORG
Secretary O
Bill B-PERSON
Richardson I-PERSON
suggested O
a O
new O
price O
cap O
for O
electricity O
throughout O
the O
western O
states O
. O

Oregon B-GPE
's O
Governor O
supports O
the O
idea O
. O

Some O
other O
western O
leaders O
are O
not O
convinced O
that O
a O
price O
cap O
will O
solve O
the O
problem O
. O

Energy O
suppliers O
oppose O
a O
cap O
, O
saying O
instead O
they O
need O
incentives O
to O
build O
more O
generating O
stations O
. O

Last B-DATE
week I-DATE
federal O
regulators O
imposed O
a O
so O
- O
called O
soft O
cap O
on O
California B-GPE
, O
which O
requires O
power O
firms O
to O
justify O
prices O
above O
150 B-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
per O
megawatt O
hour O
. O

The O
measure O
does O
not O
however O
prevent O
them O
from O
charging O
above O
that O
level O
. O

This O

more O

This O

said O
that O

he O
noted O
, O
arrivals O
totaling O
33,270 B-QUANTITY

had O

A O
similar O
situation O
apparently O
exists O
in O
the B-GPE

with O
no O

He O
said O
that O
if O
little O
cocoa O
actually O
has O
arrived O
at O
the O
ports O
, O
shipping O
delays O
could O
result O
. O

This O
is O
the O
worry O
that O
probably O
brought O
steadiness O
to O
the O
market O
earlier O
in O
the B-DATE

he O

Cargill B-PERSON
thinks O
that O
even O

there O
is O
some O

This O
modification O
, O
apparently O
, O
would O
permit O
the O

how O

it O

to O
link O

these O

come O
out O

some O
calls O

What O

your O
opinion O

I O
think O
that O

even O

that O
policy O
on O
it O
might O
take O

a O

, O

Right O

But O
, O
um O
, O
judging O
from O
the O
current O
situation O
, O
I O
personally O
think O
there O
is O
n't O
the O
basic O
support O
for O
linking O
the O

the O

Nor O
at O
the O

level O
is O
such O
a O
thing O

considered O

Looking O
at O
the O
fundamentals O
, O
can O
we O
see O
why O
the O
renminbi O
is O
appreciating O
. O

It O
's O
because O
it O

also O
, O
the O

The O

may O
seem O

the O

the O

In O

however O
, O
Mr. O

casual O
debasement O

the O

the O

at O

was O
just O
the O

As O
one B-CARDINAL
of O

He O

performing O

why O
should O
anyone O

Primarily O

there O

more O

than O
Ronald B-PERSON

Selling O
the O

is O
not O
so O
much O
a O
devaluation O
from O
the O

of O
public O
life O
today B-DATE
as O
it O
is O
a O
reflection O
of O
the O

The O

the B-DATE
1980s I-DATE
has O
been O
, O
`` O

with O

There O
are O
those O
who O
say O
that O
this O
is O
nothing O

that O
America B-GPE

always O
suffered O
from O
a O

. O

and O
they O
see O
Amy B-PERSON
Gleason I-PERSON
on O
occasion O
. O

And O
so O
I O
think O
they O
told O
me O
that O
. O

yeah O
. O

Have O
you O
heard O
from O
Ron B-PERSON
and O
Doris B-PERSON
? O

Not O
in O
a O
while O
, O
no O
. O

They O
are O
now O
living O
in O
Rhode B-GPE
Island I-GPE
. O

You O
probably O
knew O
that O
. O

Well O
. O
yeah O
. O

And O
she O
's O
teaching O
at O
U B-ORG
R I-ORG
I I-ORG
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
letter O
, O
because O
it O
sounded O
like O
she O
went O
through O
very O
similar O
things O
that O
I O
did O
. O

You O
know O
, O
I O
went O
from O
Chicago B-GPE
to O
U B-ORG
C I-ORG
S I-ORG
G I-ORG
to O
here O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
it O
's O
just O
such O
an O
intellectual O
leftd- O
letdown O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
she O
went O
from O
Penn B-ORG
to O
, O
%um O
To O
Columbia B-ORG
. O
to O
Columbia B-ORG
to O
U B-ORG
R I-ORG
I I-ORG
. O

Well O
Columbia B-ORG
's O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
she O
said O
the O
students O
are O
just O
, O

you O
know O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
, O

and O
they O
're O
not O
very O
good O
, O

and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
she O
's O
getting O
conference O
papers O
rejected O

and O
she O
thinks O
it O
's O
the O
affiliation O
. O

yeah O
. O

Because O
she O
does O
n't O
think O
the O
quality O
of O
her O
work O
has O
changed O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
n't O
submitted O
a O
conference O
paper O
with O
the O
Missouri B-ORG
%um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
w- O
affiliation O
yet O
. O

Because O
the O
last O
one O
I O
submitted O
, O
%um O
, O
was O
in O
the O
fall O
, O

and O
I O
still O
had O
my O
San B-ORG
Diego I-ORG
affiliation O
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O
, O
in O
fact O
I O
'm O
still O
officially O
on O
leave O
. O

If O
anything O
came O
up O
in O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
we O
could O
still O
go O
back O
. O
uh-huh O
. O
%uh O
you O
know O
, O
for O
Sam B-PERSON
. O

Wow O
. O

But O
I O
think O
it O
's O
e- O
very O
very O
very O
very O
yeah O
. O
unlikely O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
at O
any O
rate O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
hear O
from O
her O
because O
she O
said O
after B-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
there O
now O
, O
she O
%um O
has O
come O
to O

accepted O
that O
there O

less O
complicated O

and O
she O
has O
more O
time O

be O
a O

. O

yeah O
. O

Good O
. O

And O
she O
's O
just O
not O
going O
to O
have O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
career O
that O
she O
had O
thought O
about O
. O

Ron B-PERSON

before O

Mr. O
Spilianovich B-PERSON
spoke O
to O
reporters O
Friday B-DATE
during O
a O
visit O
to O
Washington B-GPE
. O

He O
proposed O
negotiations O
to O
determine O
whether O
Mr. O
Milosevic B-PERSON
should O
be O
tried O
in O
the O
Hague B-GPE
or O
in O
Yugoslavia B-GPE
. O


Treasury B-ORG
Secretary O
Nicholas B-PERSON
Brady I-PERSON
said O
that O
Congress B-ORG
should O
grant O
the B-ORG
Securities I-ORG
and I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
the O
power O
to O
close O
the O
stock O
markets O
in O
periods O
of O
crisis O
. O

In O
testimony O
to O
the O
Senate B-ORG
securities O
subcommittee O
, O
Mr. O
Brady B-PERSON
disputed O
the O
view O
of O
SEC B-ORG
Chairman O
Richard B-PERSON
Breeden I-PERSON
, O
who O
told O
a O
House B-ORG
panel O
Wednesday B-DATE
that O
he O
does O
n't O
want O
the O
ability O
to O
halt O
the O
markets O
. O

Mr. O
Breeden B-PERSON
contended O
that O
discretionary O
power O
could O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
the O
markets O
if O
rumors O
were O
to O
circulate O
about O
when O
the O
exchanges O
might O
be O
closed O
. O

He O
added O
that O
the O
president O
already O
has O
the O
power O
to O
close O
the O
markets O
in O
an O
emergency O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Brady B-PERSON
argued O
that O
the O
SEC B-ORG
is O
closer O
to O
the O
markets O
and O
in O
a O
better O
position O
to O
understand O
when O
the O
exchanges O
are O
under O
such O
stress O
that O
they O
should O
be O
closed O
. O

Separately O
, O
Mr. O
Brady B-PERSON
said O
he O
asked O
the B-ORG
Working I-ORG
Group I-ORG
on I-ORG
Financial I-ORG
Markets I-ORG
to O
determine O
whether O
futures O
margins O
are O
too O
low O
. O

He O
noted O
that O
some O
minimum O
margin O
requirements O
have O
been O
reduced O
to O
levels O
below O
those O
before O
the O
1987 B-DATE
crash O
. O

`` O
This O
raises O
questions O
whether O
futures O
and O
equity O
margin O
requirements O
are O
consistent O
at O
these O
levels O
and O
whether O
futures O
margins O
are O
adequate O
, O
'' O
Mr. O
Brady B-PERSON
said O
. O

Margins O
are O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
an O
investor O
needs O
to O
put O
up O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
a O
futures O
contract O
. O

Margins O
on O
the O
futures O
exchanges O
typically O
are O
raised O
and O
lowered O
according O
to O
market O
volatility O

Mr. O
Brady B-PERSON
also O
said O
he O
expects O
the O

out O

to O
`` O
end O
under O

'' O

Asked O
whether O
there O
is O
anything O
Congress B-ORG
should O
do O
to O
curb O
the O

, O
Mr. O
Brady B-PERSON
responded O
, O
`` O
I O
think O
the O

'' O

Before O
taking O

he O
advised O
the O

to O
`` O
see O
what O
the O

has O
produced O

'' O

Mr. O
Brady B-PERSON
also O
agreed O
with O
senators O
' O
concerns O
about O
recent O
stock O

volatility O
, O
and O
said O
he O
realizes O
that O
the O

are O
scaring O
investors O
from O

But O
he O
added O
that O
individuals O
still O
are O

the O

indirectly O
through O
mutual O

and O

. O

The O

refused O
to O
offer O
an O

on O
the O

which O
has O
recently O
become O
a O

he O

But O
Mr. O

at O

a O

' O

are O
still O
buried O

dinosaur O

in O
the B-LOC

This O

In O

GM B-ORG
effectively O
signed O

, O
and O
cast O
serious O
doubt O
on O
the O
futures O
of O
three B-CARDINAL
U.S. B-GPE
car O

. O

GM B-ORG
is O
under O
intense O
pressure O
to O
close O
factories O
that O
became O
unprofitable O
as O
the O
giant O
auto O
maker O

Just B-DATE
a I-DATE
month I-DATE

, O
GM B-ORG
announced O
it O
would O
make O
an O

the O
eighth B-ORDINAL

Now O
, O
GM B-ORG
appears O
to O
be O
stepping O
up O
the O
pace O
of O
its O
factory O
consolidation O
to O
get O
in O
shape O
for O
the B-DATE
1990s I-DATE
. O

One B-CARDINAL
reason O
is O
mounting O
competition O
from O
new O
Japanese B-NORP
car O
plants O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
that O
are O
pouring O
out O
more B-CARDINAL

one I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL

a O
year O
at O
costs O
lower O
than O
GM B-ORG
can O
match O
. O

Another O
is O
that O
United B-ORG

Workers I-ORG

have O
signaled O
they O
want O
tighter O

that O

GM B-ORG
officials O
want O
to O
get O
their O
strategy O
to O
reduce O
capacity O
and O
the O
work O
force O
in O
place O
before O
those O
talks O
begin O
. O

The O
problem O
, O
however O
, O
is O
that O
GM B-ORG
's O
moves O
are O
coming O
at O
a O
time O
when O
UAW B-ORG
leaders O
are O
trying O
to O

Well O
, O
this O
time O
, O
I O
think O
there O
were O
a O
few O
prominent O
features O
, O
uh O
, O
about O
new O
technologies O
. O

One O
, O
eh O
, O
was O
what O
is O
called O
TSI O
, O
which O
was O
brought O
on O
this O
occasion O
. O

This O
type O
is O
called O
a O
dual O
- O
charging O
engine O
. O

The O
use O
of O
such O
a O
dual O
- O
charging O
engine O
, O
eh O
, O
is O
its O
general O
use O
in O
products O
, O
I O
feel O
this O
is O
a O
change O
this O
time O
. O

Looking O
at O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
one O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
is O
the O
hybrid O
vehicles O
this O
time O
, O

As O
for O
the O
hybrid O
motors O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
time O
I O
observed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
generation O
hybrid O
motors O
that O
had O
been O
put O
in O
the O
products O
, O
ah O
. O

Well O
hybrid O
cars O
have O
n't O
sold O
very O
well O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
it O
seems O
. O

Um O
, O
it O
's O
just O
getting O
started O
. O

Uh O
, O
I O
feel O
it O
just O
got O
going O
, O
so O
we O
ca O
n't O
say O
they O
have O
n't O
sold O
well O
. O

Anything O
in O
its O
initial O
stage O
, O
to O
say O
that O
its O
sales O
are O
very O
low O
, O
that O
its O
buyers O
are O
few O
, O
that O
is O
, O
to O
say O
that O
it O
is O
n't O
selling O
well O
does O
n't O
really O
have O
much O
meaning O
. O

This O
, O
now O
is O
not O
eat O
%pw O
the O
summer O
when O
the O
watermelons O
will O
be O
harvested O
, O
or O
the O
time O
for O
eating O
watermelons O
, O
right O
. O

After O
measuring O
the O
current O
market O
, O
to O
say O
, O
How O
many O
watermelons O
did O
you O
sell O
today O
on O
your O
stand O
here O
. O

This O
, O
this O
is O
a O
watermelon O
that O
the O
aristocracy O
and O
rich O
want O
to O
eat O
. O

At O
this O
time O
, O
we O
ca O
n't O
come O
to O
the O
assessment O
that O
the O
watermelons O
are O
n't O
selling O
well O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
watermelons O
are O
being O
prepared O

Hey O
, O
it O

not O

under O
the O
snappy O
banner O
`` O
Creepy O
dad O

root O
of O

, O

'' O

The O
singer O
was O
brother O
Jermaine B-PERSON
, O
and O
the O
claims O
based O
on O
the O
projected O
outline O
for O
his O
abandoned O
`` O
tell O

all O
'' O
family O
story O
. O

Reading O
that O
Joseph B-PERSON
was O
a O
nightmare O
of O
a O
father O
and O
sexually O
abusive O
towards O
his O
daughters O
is O
not O
exactly O
a O
`` O
stop O
the O
presses O
'' O
moment O
. O

What O
's O
new O
is O
this O
: O

Jermaine B-PERSON
even O
suggested O
his O
father O
may O
have O
set O
up O
Michael B-PERSON
to O
be O
somehow O
victimized O
by O
older O
men O
. O

He O
tells O
how O
his O
father O
would O
have O
Michael B-PERSON
join O
in O
at O
late O
- O
night O
hotel O
room O
meetings O
with O
`` O
important O
business O
people O
, O
'' O
and O
wondered O
whether O
`` O
something O
happened O
'' O
to O
Michael B-PERSON
at O
those O
sessions O
. O

He O
said O
he O
sensed O
something O
was O
wrong O
because O
Michael B-PERSON
would O
be O
sick O
for O
days B-DATE
after O
. O

`` O
What O
was O
Joseph B-PERSON
doing O
? O
'' O
Jermaine B-PERSON
wrote O
. O

This O
lifts O
the O
Jackson B-PERSON
family O
horror O
show O
to O
a O
whole O
new O
order O
of O
dysfunction O
, O
one O
that O
sees O
parents O
network O
with O
power O
and O
trade O
their O
children O
for O
privilege O
. O

This O
should O
be O
a O
motif O
familiar O
to O
anyone O
acquainted O
with O
the O
literature O
of O
mind O
control O
and O
ritual O
abuse O
survivors O
: O
the O
father O

first O
controller O

passing O
his O

up O
the O
social O
ladder O
of O
abuse O
in O
return O
for O
status O

protection O

All O
that O
's O
missing O
is O
the O
element O
of O
occult O
terror O

Or O
maybe O
not O
: O
`` O
LaToya B-PERSON

'' O

Perhaps O
we O
can O
take O
more O
from O
this O
than O
the O
suspicion O
that O
the O
Jackson B-PERSON
clan O
had O
gotten O
with O
the O
program O
. O

Perhaps O
rather O
the O
point O
is O
that O
the O
program O
exploits O
pre-existing O
conditions O
for O
abuse O
which O
are O
more O
common O
than O
most O

we O

of O

on O
the O

consider O
this O

In O
a O
recent O

escapade O
, O
Dick B-PERSON
Cheney I-PERSON
accidentally O
shot O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
his O
hunting O

There O
may O

been O
negligence O

that O
is O
up O

decide O

But O
more O

, O
I O
think O
, O
is O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
hunt O
. O

These O
were O
not O
wild O
birds O

The O
birds O
were O
bred O

They O
had O
spent O
their O
lives O

then O
on O

were O
released O
for O
the O
sole O
purpose O
of O
being O
killed O
by O
Dick B-PERSON

Whether O
you O
are O
an O
animal O

or O
not O
, O
there O
is O
something O
disgusting O
and O
degrading O
about O
this O
kind O
of O

something O
less O

human O
about O

that O

Could O

more O
. O

I O
think O
that O
pedophilia O

relative O
commonality O
is O
what O
really O
makes O
it O
frightening O
. O

My O
experience O
happened O
when O
I O
was O
15 B-CARDINAL
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
met O
this O
guy O
who O
was O
twice O
our O
age O
-AMP- O
who O
was O
more O
than O
willing O
to O
buy O
us O
all O
the O
whiskey O
we O
could O
drink O
. O

We O
were O
both O
enamored O
with O
Kerouac B-PERSON
-AMP- O
Jim B-PERSON
Morrison I-PERSON
-AMP- O
meeting O
strange O
characters O
-AMP- O
this O
guy O
definitely O
fit O
the O
bill O
. O

He O
was O
muscle O
for O
a O
Pittsburgh B-GPE
madam O
named O
Tex B-PERSON
Gill I-PERSON
. O

She O
dressed O
like O
a O
man O
-AMP- O
ran O
most O
of O
the O
massage O
parlors O
in O
Pgh B-GPE
. O

He O
was O
into O
black O
magick O
-AMP- O
Crowley B-PERSON
-AMP- O
booze O
-AMP- O
drugs O
-AMP- O
on O
-AMP- O
on O
. O

So O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
night O
, O
we O
're O
at O
his O
apartment O
, O
drunk O
out O
of O
our O
minds O
, O

-AMP- O
my O
buddy O
passes O
out O
. O

I O
continue O
drinking O
. O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
point O
, O
I O
glance O
at O
this O
older O
guy O
, O

-AMP- O
he O
is O
staring O
at O
my O
buddy O
as O
a O
line O
of O
drool O
runs O
down O
the O
cigarette O
in O
his O
mouth O
-AMP- O
drips O
on O
to O
the O
floor O
. O

I O
think O
, O
' O
What O
the O
fuck O
? O
' O

but O
I O
'm O
pretty O
goddamn O
wasted O

-AMP- O
reality O
is O
having O
a O
helluva O
time O
penetrating O
the O
fog O
in O
my O
head O
. O

He O
notices O
that O
I O
'm O
kind O
of O
staring O
at O
him O
. O

He O
stands O
up O
, O
walks O
into O
the O
bedroom O
, O
-AMP- O
comes O
back O
with O
a O
porno O
mag O
. O

He O
drops O
it O
on O
the O
couch O
next O
to O
me O
. O

As O
he O
's O
sitting O
down O
, O
he O
says O
, O
`` O
See O
anything O
you O
like O
? O
'' O

-AMP- O
then O
he O
shoves O
his O
hand O
hard O
into O
my O
groin O
..... O

.... O
-AMP- O
I O
broke O
his O
nose O
with O
my O
elbow O
. O

Make O
no O
mistake O
though O
, O
up O
till O
that O
point O
, O
the O
guy O
scared O
the O
shit O
out O
of O
me O
. O

But O
, O
lucky O
for O
me O
, O
my O
reaction O
was O
see O
red O
anger O
instead O
of O
cowering O
fear O
. O

After O
i O
hit O
him O
, O
I O
jumped O
up O
, O
ran O
into O
his O
kitchen O
-AMP- O
grabbed O
a O
big O
old O
butcher O
knife O
, O
ran O
back O
into O
the O
room O
-AMP- O
proceeded O
to O
kick O
my O
buddy O
into O
consciousness O
-AMP- O
drag O
his O
comatose O
ass O
the O
hell O
out O
of O
there O
. O

Now O
, O
for O
me O
, O
the O
interesting O
part O
happened O
years O
later O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
my O
buddy O
-AMP- O
I O
were O
selling O
things O
. O

My O
buddy O
had O
a O
real O
good O
supplier O
for O
these O
things O
but O
it O
was O
his O
secret O
. O

At O
one O
point O
, O
my O
buddy O
could O
n't O
pick O
up O
the O
shipment O
so O
I O
had O
to O
go O
. O

Before O
I O
left O
, O
he O
had O
to O
explain O
to O
me O
that O
his O
supplier O
was O
none O
other O
than O
Freddie O
Feelup O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
go O
. O

He O
was O
now O
closer O
to O
40 B-CARDINAL

just O
a O
hollow O
shell O
of O
his O
former O
self O

Friendless O
, O
his O
only O
company O
being O
neighborhood O

looking O

He O
kept O
one B-CARDINAL
room O
empty O
except O
for O
4 B-CARDINAL
black O
candles O
in O
each O
of O
its O
corners O
. O

he O
would O
read O
curses O
aimed O
at O
people O
who O
pissed O
him O
off O
. O

Really O
pathetic O
. O

About B-DATE

him O

I O

I O
do O

My O
question O
is O
, O
when O
is O
a O
victim O
guilty O
of O
abuse O
? O

Jackson B-PERSON
is O
definitely O
a O
mind O

control O
, O
SRA O
victim O
. O

He O
's O
programmed O
. O

Neverland B-FAC
sounds O
like O
a O
cryptic O
command O
from O
MKULTRA O
Wizard O
of O
Oz O
programming O
. O

The O
bizarre O
from O
black O
- O
to O
- O
white O
and O
physical O
transformation O
must O
be O
the O
result O
of O

. O

If O
he O
does O
abuse O
' O
his O
' O
children O
, O
is O
he O
' O
guilty O
' O
as O
such O
if O
he O
is O

I O
suspect O
he O
is O
a O
brilliant O
cover O
or O
red O

herring O
used O
as O
a O
shield O
by O
very O
powerful O

responsible O

what O
at O

It O
's O
very O

as O

that O

MJ B-PERSON

naive O
he O
's O
not O

of O
the O

associated O

activity O
. O

This O
may O
not O
be O
the O
case O
, O
as O
the O
public O
' O

' O
is O
merely O
an O

and O
he O
may O

the O

whether O

If O
so O

then O
they O
are O
all O
guilty O
of O

at O
the O

As O
most O

is O
generational O
, O
the O
whole O

really O
has O
to O
be O
brought O
out O
in O

The O

for O
a O
cool O

for O

Thought O

it O
to O

it O
is O
that O
all O

Anonymous B-PERSON
One I-PERSON

I O
recall O
reading O
somewhere O
that O
Lisa B-PERSON
Marie I-PERSON
was O
a O
member O
of O
L.Ron B-PERSON
's O
cult O
. O

You O
will O
notice O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
real O
troubles O
started O
after O
he O
suied O
Sony B-ORG
chief O
Tommy B-PERSON
Mattola I-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
heard O
to O
say O
`` O
he O
'll O
live O
to O
regret O
the O
day B-DATE

. O

Do O
n't O
ever O
think O
of O

with O
the O
evil O
bastards O
in O
the O
Music O

, O
later O
. O

Here O
's O
a O
description O
of O
that O
Michael B-PERSON
Jackson I-PERSON
item O
I O
was O
remembering O
: O

By O
the O
time O
the O
release O
of O
1995 B-DATE
's O
HIStory B-WORK_OF_ART
album O
-- O
a O
double O
album O
of O
greatest O
hits O
and O
new O
tracks O
-- O
approached O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
had O
fully O
realized O
a O
new O
perception O
of O
himself O
, O
one O
that O
was O
truly O
larger O
than O
life O
. O

HIStory B-WORK_OF_ART
was O
hyped O
with O
a O
four B-CARDINAL
- O
minute B-TIME
teaser O
video O
. O

This O
extravagant O
production O
begins O
with O
a O
colossal O
army O
goose O
- O
stepping O
through O
a O
European B-NORP
city O
in O
crisp O
, O
tan O
uniforms O
, O
waving O
red O
flags O
and O
sporting O
red O
- O
and O
- O
black O
insignias O
. O

Military O
music O
pounds O
. O

Crowds O
swell O
at O
the O
sidelines O
, O
screaming O
and O
crying O
. O

The O
implication O
seems O
to O
be O
these O
men O
represent O
Nazis B-NORP
. O

But O
then O
, O
their O
leader O
is O
revealed O
to O
be O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
marching O
right O
up O
front O
. O

When O
peasant O
workers O
break O
free O
to O
touch O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
they O
are O
immediately O
swallowed O
by O
soldiers O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
it O
is O
night O
, O
and O
a O
tarp O
- O
covered O
, O
skyscraper O
- O
sized O
structure O
looms O
over O
the O
poor O
nation O
as O
choppers O
spray O
spotlights O
across O
it O
. O

Brainwashed O
fans O
scream O
, O
salute O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
arm O
and O
light O
candles O
with O
religious O
zeal O
. O

Signs O
proclaiming O
`` O
King B-PERSON
of I-PERSON
Pop I-PERSON
, O
'' O
a O
title O
Michael B-PERSON
disavowed O
to O
Oprah B-PERSON
only O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
earlier I-DATE
, O
are O
everywhere O
, O
emphasizing O
the O
word O
`` O
King O
. O
'' O

Finally O
, O
the O
tarp O
drops O
, O
and O
it O
is O
, O
of O
course O
, O
a O
gargantuan O
, O
bronze O
statue O
of O
Michael B-PERSON
, O
fists O
clenched O
defiantly O
, O
his O
star O
insignia O
prominent O
, O
yet O
his O
face O
still O
somehow O
child O
- O
like O
and O
unthreatening O
. O

The O
video O
is O
a O
highly O
disturbing O
piece O
of O
work O
. O

His O
bloated O
sense O
of O
importance O
is O
not O
only O
chilling O
, O
it O
is O
threatening O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
's O
perfect O
world O
of O
Oz B-LOC
/ O
Neverland B-LOC
is O
forced O
to O
be O
compared O
with O
an B-ORG
Aryan I-ORG
Nation I-ORG
, O
one O
that O
substitutes O
children O
for O
Hitler B-PERSON
's O
master O
race O
. O

There O
is O
some O
sort O
of O
an O
emblem O
with O
a O
star O
on O
his O
shoulder O
, O
but O
it O
's O
at O
an O
angle O
and O
not O
easy O
to O
make O
out O
clearly O

'' O

in O
March B-DATE

Jackson B-PERSON

Anyone O
else O
smell O
a O

sideshow O
from O
awhile O
back O
? O
trivial O
, O
but O
here O
's O
stargods B-PERSON
' O
comprehensive O
analysis O
of O
jacko B-PERSON
: O

regarding O
the O
JW B-ORG
reference O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
need O
see O
a O
plot O
in O
every O
wood O
pile O
. O

The O
JW B-ORG
considers O
itself O
THE O
kingdom O
of O
God O
on O
earth O
. O

-LRB- O
' O
Kindom O
Hall O
' O
-RRB- O

So O
it O
is O
only O
to O
be O
expected O
that O
they O
do O
not O
see O
a O
reason O
to O
run O
to O
and O
report O
everything O
to O
the O
government O
. O

The O
same O
goes O
for O
the B-ORG
Roman I-ORG
Catholic I-ORG
Church I-ORG
. O

But O
the O
RCC B-ORG
has O
had O
a O
widespread O
problem O
with O
this O
regard O
, O
doubltlessly O
because O
their O
policy O
/ O
doctrine O
of O
a O
celibate O
priesthood O
simply O
attracts O
these O
deviants O
. O

I O
doubt O
any O
such O
problem O
exist O
on O
the O
same O
proportionate O
scale O
in O
the O
JW B-ORG
heirarchy O
. O

Besides O
that O
, O
ca O
n't O
you O
see O
the O
embedded O
mind O
control O
in O
that O
article O
, O
as O
well O
as O
all O
general O
media O
output O
. O

The O
Message O
Is O
: O
`` O
Big O
Brother O
must O
be O
informed O
! O

Only O
Big O
Brother O
can O
manage O
society O
! O
'' O

See O
, O
it O
's O
the O
Hegelian O
dialectic O
at O
work O
. O

Eveyone O
needs O
to O
sharpen O
their O
awareness O
of O
this O
shit O
. O

As O
long O
as O
Big O
Brother O
is O
the O
answer O
for O
everything O
, O
Big O
Brother O
will O
BE O
everything O
. O

-LRB- O
If O
people O
do O
n't O
want O
their O
kids O
pederastized O
, O
but O
yet O
they O
entrust O
them O
to O
' O
guys O
in O

' O
I O
just O
wonder O
what O
the O
hell O
are O
they O
thinking O
anyway O
? O
-RRB- O

I O
'd O
watch O
the O
Peter B-PERSON

, O
unless O
you O
know O
what O
versions O
you O
are O
discussing O
and O
can O
differentiate O
between O
them O
accurately O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
assumptions O
I O
've O
seen O

such O
as O
a O

either O
a O
tenuous O
or O
no O

Peter B-PERSON
and O
the O

crave O
a O

to O
tell O

It O
's O
ironic O
that O

are O

more O
exotic O
than O

tells O

those O
fictions O
that O

Barrie B-PERSON
says O
quite O
explicitly O
in O
Peter B-WORK_OF_ART
and I-WORK_OF_ART
Wendy I-WORK_OF_ART
that O
it O
is O
Wendy B-PERSON
who O
does O
the O
tempting O
to O
keep O
Peter B-PERSON
with O
her O
, O
not O
the O
other O
way O
around O

It O
is O
she O
who O
asks O
if O
Michael B-PERSON

John B-PERSON
could O
come O
too O

If O
those O
of O
you O
with O

would O
like O
to O

on O
where O
it O
is O
shown O
that O
Peter B-PERSON
abducted O
the O
children O
, O
please O
do O
. O

But O
I O
think O
you O
are O
making O
it O
up O
from O
a O
version O
that O
does O
n't O
exist O
in O
reality O
, O
or O
that O
ca O
n't O
be O
tied O

We O

About O
the O
JW B-ORG
thing O
, O
I O
work O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
them O
-LRB- O
BTW O
, O
some O
of O
the O
most O
respectable O
people O
I O
know O
. O

Which O
is O
why O
I O
decided O
to O
ask O
... O
-RRB- O
, O

and O
I O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
ask O
them O
about O
MJ B-PERSON
and O
the O
child O
abuse O
, O
if O
they O
knew O
anything O
. O

About O
MJ B-PERSON
they O
said O
, O
he O
is O
definately O
not O
a O
JW B-NORP
, O
despite O
what O
he O
says O
. O

Provocative O
lyrics O
and O
grabbing O
ones O
crotch O
in O
public O
, O
does O
n't O
fit O
with O
their O
defination O
of O
' O
Christian B-NORP
' O
. O

They O
said O
all O
they O
knew O
was O
that O
his O
mother O
-LRB- O
who O
apparently O
is O
still O
a O
member O
-RRB- O
took O
him O
to O
their O
church O
as O
a O
kid O
. O

The O
father O
apparently O
had O
little O
or O
no O
involvement O
at O
all O
. O

As O
for O
the O
child O
abuse O
, O
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
post O
above O
, O
you O
can O
find O
abuse O
and O
' O
sick O
' O
individuals O
in O
ANY O
organization O
, O

but O
you O
have O
too O
look O
at O
the O
proportion O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
society O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
my O
friends O
is O
an O
' O
elder O
' O
-LRB- O
soething O
like O
a O
' O
local O
church O
leader O
' O
-RRB- O
, O

but O
he O
also O
said O
their O
instructions O
say O
that O
if O
they O
hear O
of O
any O
abuse O
they O
are O
to O
follow O
local O
laws O
, O
which O
usually O
requires O
them O
to O
inform O
the O
police O
ASAP O
. O

And O
if O
the O
abuse O
is O
at O
all O
serious O
to O
report O
it O
to O
the O
police O
regardless O
. O

Though O
i O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
all O
of O
their O
beliefs O
, O
I O
know O
these O
guys O
well O
enough O
to O
call O
them O
friends O
. O

So O
in O
their O
respect O
, O
after O

I O
decided O
to O
listen O
to O
their O
side O
before O
passing O

We O
should O
ALL O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
pass O
judgement O
on O
ENTIRE O
groups O
of O
people O
based O
on O
the O
apparent O
actions O
of O
a O
few O
. O

That O
is O
what O
Hitler B-PERSON
tried O
to O

With O
thiking O
like O
that O
, O
even O
if O
we O
got O
rid O
of O
the O
evil O
elite O
, O
a O
new O
set O
of O
' O
evil O
elite O
' O
would O
rise O
again O
in O
their O
place O
. O

That O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
nature O
of O
man O
, O
though O
. O

We O
have O
all O
got O
to O
do O
what O
we O
can O
without O
needlessly O
attacking O
the O
innocent O
. O

Remember O
, O

only O
plays O
into O

be O

Mr. O

the O

according O

He O
said O
Drexel B-ORG
-- O
the O

could O
no O
longer O
afford O
to O
sell O
any O

if O

might O
later O
become O
troubled O
because O
Drexel B-ORG
risked O
losing O
its O
highly O
lucrative O

. O

The O
dinner O
was O
a O
stark O

that O

Amid O

Although O

Drexel B-ORG

the O

comes O

Stretching O
his O

in O
his O
silky O
white O

squeaking O
his O
black O

, O
he O
lectures O
a O
visitor O
about O
the O
way O
to O
sell O
American B-NORP
real O

and O
boasts O
about O
his O
friendship O
with O
Margaret B-PERSON
Thatcher I-PERSON

son O

But O
when O
asked O
what O
exactly O
he O
does O
in O
business O
, O
he O
immediately O
takes O
offense O

`` O
Are O
you O

he O
snaps O

`` O
You O

Not O
many O

know O
the O

of O
Mr. O
Morishita B-PERSON

business O

it O

a O
source O
of O

about O

When O
a O

goes O
belly O

up O
, O
for O

, O
the O
gossipy O
weekly B-DATE
magazines O
are O
often O
quick O
to O
link O
the O
demise O

Aichi B-PERSON

Mr. O
Morishita B-PERSON
scoffs O
at O
those O
stories O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
ones O
connecting O
him O
to O
the O
Japanese B-NORP

He O
says O

Mr. O

out O

From O

, O
he O
set O
up O

rapidly O
expanded O
from O

to O

in O

to O
building O

He O
spends O
most B-DATE

He O

The O

Although O
Mr. O

says O
little O
about O

he O
offers O
one B-CARDINAL
rule O
to O

Never O

`` O

As O
Georgia B-ORG
- I-ORG
Pacific I-ORG
's I-ORG
bid O
for O
Great B-ORG
Northern I-ORG
Nekoosa I-ORG
has O
shown O
, O
uninvited O
takeovers O
are O
still O
alive O
despite O
premature O
reports O
of O
their O
demise O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
debate O
about O
poison O
pills O
will O
continue O
to O
rage O
in O
the O
boardrooms O
of O
corporations O
and O
the O
halls O
of O
academia O
. O

Although O
poison O
pills O
come O
in O
different O
colors O
and O
shapes O
, O
they O
usually O
give O
current O
shareholders O
the O
right O
to O
buy O
more O
stock O
of O
their O
corporation O
at O
a O
large O
discount O
if O
certain O
events O
occur O
-- O
typically O
, O
if O
a O
hostile O
bidder O
acquires O
more O
than O
a O
specified O
percentage O
of O
the O
corporation O
's O
stock O
. O

However O
, O
these O
discount O
purchase O
rights O
may O
generally O
be O
redeemed O
at O
a O
nominal O
cost O
by O
the O
corporation O
's O
directors O
if O
they O
approve O
of O
a O
bidder O
. O

Supporters O
of O
poison O
pills O
argue O
that O
their O
adoption O
forces O
bidders O
to O
negotiate O
with O
a O
corporation O
's O
directors O
, O
who O
are O
thereby O
put O
in O
a O
better O
position O
to O
pursue O
the O
long O
- O
term O
interests O
of O
the O
corporation O
. O

Recent O
studies O
by O
Georgeson B-ORG
-AMP- I-ORG
Co. I-ORG
conclude O
that O
corporations O
with O
poison O
pills O
have O
experienced O
greater O
stock O
- O
price O
appreciation O
than O
corporations O
without O
poison O
pills O
during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Critics O
of O
poison O
pills O
argue O
that O
they O
harm O
shareholders O
by O
letting O
corporate O
management O
defeat O
takeover O
bids O
at O
premium O
prices O
and O
by O
deterring O
premium O
bids O
from O
ever O
being O
made O
to O
shareholders O
. O

These O
critics O
are O
backed O
by O
several O
academic O
studies O
showing O
that O
the O
adoption O
of O
poison O
pills O
reduces O
shareholder O
values O
not O
merely O
in O
the O
short O
run O
, O
but O
also O
over O
longer O
periods O
. O

Institutional O
investors O
that O
must O
evaluate O
poison O
pills O
on O
a O
regular O
basis O
are O
interested O
less O
in O
this O
general O
debate O
than O
in O
the O
answers O
to O
specific O
questions O
about O
the O
corporation O
issuing O
the O
pill O
. O

Does O
this O
corporation O
have O
a O
high O
- O
quality O
management O
team O
with O
a O
good O
track O
record O
? O

Does O
this O
team O
have O
a O
viable O
strategy O
for O
improving O
shareholder O
values O
, O
and O
does O
this O
strategy O
require O
implementation O
over O
an O
extended O
period O
? O

Will O
the O
adoption O
of O
this O
particular O
form O
of O
a O
poison O
pill O
significantly O
improve O
the O
chances O
for O
management O
to O
carry O
out O
this O
strategy O
? O

If O
the O
answers O
to O
these O
questions O
are O
affirmative O
, O
then O
institutional O
investors O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
favorably O
disposed O
toward O
a O
specific O
poison O
pill O
. O

However O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
once O
most O
poison O
pills O
are O
adopted O
, O
they O
survive O
forever B-DATE
. O

Although O
the O
current O
management O
team O
may O
be O
outstanding O
, O
who O
will O
be O
the O
CEO O
in O
10 B-DATE
years I-DATE
? O

Although O
the O
five B-DATE
- I-DATE
year I-DATE
strategy O
may O
be O
excellent O
, O
what O
will O
be O
the O
strategy O
in O
25 B-DATE
years I-DATE
? O

The O
solution O
to O
this O
problem O
is O
a O
time O
- O
limited O
poison O
pill O
. O

The O
limit O
could O
range O
from O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
to I-DATE
seven I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
depending O
on O
the O
composition O
of O
the O
management O
team O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
its O
strategic O
plan O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
this O
period O
, O
the O
poison O
pill O
would O
be O
eliminated O
automatically O
, O
unless O
a O
new O
poison O
pill O
were O
approved O
by O
the O
then O
- O
current O
shareholders O
, O
who O
would O
have O
an O
opportunity O
to O
evaluate O
the O
corporation O
's O
strategy O
and O
management O
team O
at O
that O
time O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
rare O
example O
of O
a O
time O
- O
limited O
poison O
pill O
is O
the O
shareholder O
rights O
plan O
adopted O
by O
Pennzoil B-ORG
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
after O
it O
received O
a O
huge O
litigation O
settlement O
from O
Texaco B-ORG
. O

Pennzoil B-ORG
's O
poison O
pill O
covers O
five B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
order O
to O
give O
current O
management O
enough O
time O
to O
put O
these O
proceeds O
to O
work O
in O
a O
prudent O
manner O
. O

Another O
interesting O
example O
is O
the O
poison O
pill O
adopted O
recently O
by O
Pittsburgh B-GPE
- O
based O
National B-ORG
Intergroup I-ORG
Inc. I-ORG

, O
which O

7 I-PERCENT

's O
voting O
stock O
, O
worked O
with O
management O
to O
devise O
a O
time O
- O
limited O
poison O
pill O
. O

This O
pill O
automatically O
expires O
after O
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
unless O
continued O
by O
a O
vote O
of O
the O
shareholders O
. O

The O
attitude O
of O
the B-ORG
Wisconsin I-ORG
Investment I-ORG
Board I-ORG
reflects O
a O
growing O
receptivity O
to O
time O
- O
limited O
poison O
pills O
on O
the O
part O
of O
institutional O
investors O
, O
as O
shown O
by O
the O
discussions O
at O
recent O
meetings O
of O
the B-ORG
Council I-ORG
of I-ORG
Institutional I-ORG
Investors I-ORG
and O
my O
informal O
survey O
of O
several O
retirement O
plans O
with O
large O
stock O
positions O
. O

More O
widespread O
time O
limits O
on O
poison O
pills O
would O
allow O
shareholders O
to O
evaluate O
a O
specific O
poison O
pill O
within O
the O
context O
of O
a O
specific O
management O
team O
's O
strategy O
. O

Such O
concrete O
analysis O
is O
likely O
to O
lead O
to O
more O
fruitful O
dialogue O
between O
management O
and O
shareholders O
than O
the O
abstract O
debate O
about O

both O

depend O
on O

Journalism O
is O
not O
just O
a O
profession O
, O
but O
should O
also O
be O
a O
vocation O
- O
you O
have O
to O
throw O
yourself O
fully O
into O
this O
infinitely O
broad O
field O
of O
endeavor O
. O

Intellectually O
and O
spiritually O
, O
in O
work O
and O
in O
love O
, O
I O
have O
gained O
experience O
and O
fulfilment O
. O

I O
have O
always O
remembered O
the O
encouragement O
which O
Mr. O
Yu B-PERSON
Youren I-PERSON
gave O
me O
as O
a O
young O
reporter O
. O

He O
said O
that O
to O
be O
a O
fearless O
champion O
of O
social O
justice O
, O
as O
is O
expected O
of O
a O
journalist O
, O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
, O
apart O
from O
energy O
and O
vitality O
, O
is O
modesty O
. O

You O
have O
to O
treat O
everybody O
the O
same O
, O
and O
not O
be O
overawed O
by O
the O
great O
and O
powerful O
. O

A O
president O
or O
a O
street O
sweeper O
deserve O
the O
same O
respect O
as O
a O
human O
being O
, O
and O
should O
both O
be O
treated O
the O
same O
way O
. O

Funnily O
enough O
, O
an O
unassuming O
attitude O
is O
also O
advantageous O
in O
relations O
with O
the O
opposite O
sex O
. O

Chinese B-NORP
society O
is O
male O
dominated O
, O
and O
women O
are O
mostly O
regarded O
as O
having O
a O
subsidiary O
role O
. O

In O
this O
kind O
of O
unfair O
situation O
, O
an O
upstanding O
man O
should O
cherish O
and O
respect O
women O
all O
the O
more O
. O

A O
considerate O
attitude O
can O
be O
expressed O
in O
little O
things O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
when O
you O
see O
that O
a O
hair O
has O
fallen O
onto O
a O
female O
friend O
's O
shoulder O
, O
you O
should O
lightly O
pick O
it O
off O
for O
her O
, O
and O
throw O
it O
away O
or O
put O
it O
in O
your O
pocket O
. O

If O
sincere O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
action O
is O
attractive O
in O
a O
man O
. O

If O
a O
woman O
expresses O
her O
liking O
for O
you O
, O
then O
no O
matter O
whether O
she O
is O
pretty O
, O
or O
whether O
you O
find O
her O
attractive O
, O
you O
should O
respond O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
respect O
. O

When O
I O
was O
a O
young O
reporter O
stationed O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
there O
was O
a O
British B-NORP
woman O
reporter O
who O
liked O
me O
very O
much O
. O

Once O
I O
was O
driving O
her O
somewhere O
to O
report O
a O
story O
when O
we O
had O
an O
accident O
, O
and O
she O
suffered O
some O
badly O
broken O
bones O
. O

Although O
I O
was O
n't O
attracted O
to O
her O
in O
that O
way O
, O
I O
went O
to O
see O
her O
every O
day O
in O
hospital O
, O
and O
this O
left O
a O
deep O
impression O
on O
her O
of O
how O
considerate O
Chinese B-NORP
men O
can O
be O
. O

Looking O
back O
at O
my O
life O
, O
I O
've O
hardly O
had O
any O
really O
bad O
experiences O
in O
my O
relationships O
with O
women O
, O
and O
this O
is O
because O
just O
as O
in O
my O
professional O
life O
, O
I O
've O
always O
maintained O
a O
self O
- O
critical O
attitude O
towards O
my O
emotions O
, O
and O
always O
tried O
to O
prevent O
myself O
acting O
like O
a O
male O
chauvinist O
. O

Looks O
are O
something O
you O
are O
born O
with O
, O
but O
character O
is O
something O
you O
can O
work O
on O
, O
and O
it O
can O
outweigh O
your O
appearance O

But O
he O
was O
tremendously O
well O

read O

had O
a O
beautiful O

and O
for O
a O
time O
he O
was O

India B-GPE
. O

His O
wife O
was O
a O
universally O
admired O
beauty O

the O
envy O

all O

So O
I O
say O
, O
" O
handsome O
is O
as O
handsome O
does O
. O
" O

I O
was O
imprisoned O
by O
both O
the O
Kuomintang B-ORG
and O
the O
Communists B-NORP
, O
and O
at O
times O
I O
might O
have O
been O
killed O
. O

Perhaps O
other O
people O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
might O
have O
wallowed O
in O
self O
- O
pity O
, O
but O
I O
saw O
it O
as O
a O
rare O
opportunity O
in O
life O
. O

In O
1951 B-DATE
, O
in O
a O
dark O
prison O
cell O
during O
a O
big O
Communist B-NORP
purge O
, O
what O
came O
into O
my O
mind O
was O
not O
fear O
of O
death O
. O

Instead O
, O
I O
wondered O
what O
kind O
of O
headline O
my O
death O
would O
merit O
in O
the O
newspapers O
. O

" O

? O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
this O
eternal O
optimism O
which O
changed O
my O
frame O
of O
mind O
and O
my O
appearance O
. O

This O
is O
the O
advice O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
give O
young O
people O
: O

it O
's O
true O
that O
good O
looks O
can O
come O
from O
external O
grooming O
, O
wearing O
nice O
clothes O
, O
or O
wearing O
earrings O
; O
and O
perhaps O
you O
can O
get O
other O
people O
's O
attention O
by O
creating O
your O
own O
special O
look O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
overdo O
it O
. O

It O
is O
appropriate O
dress O
, O
and O
a O
temperament O
developed O
through O
study O
and O
practice O
, O
which O
really O
make O
a O
man O
attractive O

The O

of O
literature O

Having O
a O
chance O
to O
see O
Gao B-PERSON
in O
person O
, O
TIBE B-EVENT
visitors O
naturally O
focused O
on O
his O
artistic O
vision O
and O
creative O
process O
. O

In O
a O
speech O
presented O
at O
the O
exhibition O
, O
Gao B-PERSON
stated O
that O
over O
the O
course O
of O
decades O
of O
writing O
, O
he O
has O
given O
ever O
- O
greater O
attention O
to O
the O
heart O
of O
literature O
- O
the O
art O
of O
language O
. O

To O
Gao B-PERSON
, O
the O
only O
standard O
for O
judging O
literature O
is O
the O
beauty O
of O
its O
language O
, O
and O
language O
itself O
is O
a O
means O
of O
getting O
at O
" O
reality O
. O
" O

Gao B-PERSON
refers O
to O
his O
own O
approach O
to O
writing O
as O
" O
stream O
- O
of O
- O
language O
" O
and O
believes O
that O
writers O
who O
seek O
a O
vivid O
, O
modern O
Chinese B-NORP
face O
an O
extremely O
difficult O
path O
. O

Gao B-PERSON
also O
revealed O
that O
to O
ensure O
that O
his O
own O
writing O
remains O
fresh O
and O
lively O
, O
he O
first O
speaks O
his O
thoughts O
into O
a O
recorder O
before O
later O
recasting O
them O
in O
a O
written O
form O
. O

Gao B-PERSON
Xingjian I-PERSON
feels O
that O
writing O
is O
an O
extremely O
personal O
pursuit O
, O
that O
its O
starting O
point O
is O
a O
quest O
for O
personal O
values O
. O

If O
a O
writer O
is O
to O
produce O
good O
work O
, O
he O
must O
cast O
aside O
political O
and O
social O
missions O
, O
disregard O
the O
opinions O
of O
readers O
and O
the O
market O
, O
and O
instead O
must O
write O
spontaneously O
, O
listening O
carefully O
to O
the O
faintest O
, O
most O
honest O
voice O
in O
his O
heart O
. O

Considering O
that O
Gao B-PERSON
fled O
a O
tyrannical O
government O
to O
become O
an O
expatriate O
, O
many O
people O
wonder O
whether O
Gao B-PERSON
's O
literature O
insists O
upon O
humanitarianism O
and O
high O
principles O
. O

But O
Gao B-PERSON
feels O
that O
literature O
is O
above O
politics O
and O
should O
not O
serve O
it O
. O

Further O
, O
literature O
should O
not O
be O
limited O
by O
morals O
, O
ethics O
or O
public O
sentiment O
. O

In O
Gao B-PERSON
's O
view O
, O
20th B-DATE
century I-DATE
literature O
too O
often O
emphasized O
" O
literary O
revolution O
" O
or O
was O
" O
revolutionary O
literature O
. O
" O

It O
was O
too O
often O
tied O
to O
a O
preposterous O
sense O
of O
mission O
which O
took O
literature O
with O
it O
to O
the O
grave O
. O

As O
Gao B-PERSON
said O
at O
the O
Nobel B-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
awards O
ceremony O
, O
Communist B-NORP
rule O
stymied O
the O
development O
of O
mainland O
Chinese B-NORP
literature O
. O

Not O
surprisingly O
, O
the O
Chinese B-NORP
Communists B-NORP
were O
critical O
of O
the O
selection O
of O
Gao B-PERSON
as O
a O
Nobel O
Laureate O
, O
labeling O
his O
choice O
an O
" O
imperialist O
conspiracy O
" O
and O
another O
" O
insult O
to O
all O
Chinese B-NORP
" O
by O
the O
West B-LOC
. O

This O
standoff O
between O
the O
Nobel O
laureate O
and O
his O
cultural O
motherland O
adds O
a O
note O
of O
regret O
to O
the O
joy O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
around O
the O
world O
. O

Soul B-WORK_OF_ART

Given O
that O
Gao B-PERSON

his O

with O
some O

into O
a O
field O
with O
which O
most O
are O
unfamiliar O
. O

Gao B-PERSON
has O
touched O
off O
another O
interesting O
debate O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
- O
one O
on O
the O
competing O
desires O
of O
the O
spirit O
and O
the O
flesh O
. O

Discussing O
Gao B-PERSON
together O
with O
former O
Japanese B-NORP
porn O
star O
Iijima B-PERSON
Ai I-PERSON
causes O
many O
cultural O
critics O
to O
shake O
their O
heads O
, O
but O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
writers O
' O
works O
are O
not O
that O
dissimilar O
. O

While O
Soul B-WORK_OF_ART
Mountain I-WORK_OF_ART
describes O
one O
man O
's O
spiritual O
journey O
, O
it O
also O
contains O
numerous O
graphic O
descriptions O
of O
sexual O
desire O
. O

Similarly O
, O
Ai B-PERSON
's O
book O
on O
the O
flesh O
actually O
expresses O
her O
longing O
for O
spiritual O
love O
. O

These O
two B-CARDINAL
works O
remind O
us O
that O
the O
spirit O
and O
the O
flesh O
are O
both O
aspects O
of O
being O
human O
and O
that O
the O
distance O
between O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
" O
opposing O
desires O
" O
is O
not O
as O
great O
as O
most O

, O

, O
the O
only O

to O

when O

periodically O

This O

in O

Mr. O
Savaiko B-PERSON
noted O
that O
copper O
had O
a O
steep O
fall O
in O
spite O
of O
a O
weak O
dollar O
, O
which O
would O
normally O
support O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
copper O
market O
. O

Such O
support O
usually O
comes O
from O
arbitragers O
who O
use O
a O
strong O
British B-NORP
pound O
to O
buy O
copper O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
. O

`` O
The O

Mr. O

that O

PRECIOUS O

Such O

are O
watched O
closely O
by O

traders O
because O
both O

used O
in O

Mr. O
Savaiko B-PERSON
theorized O
that O
the O
news O

the O

proof O

he O
considered O

Everybody O
that O

every O
sailor O
that O
's O
entering O

take O
a O

They O
learn O
how O
to O
tread O
water O
and O
do O
the O
dead O
man O
float O
and O
they O
have O
to O
pass O
that O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
on O

Also O
drills O
take O

get O
on O

Usually O
twice O

where O

where O
to O
report O
to O

indeed O
a O
man O
overboard O
takes O
place O
and O
as O
the O
deployment O
begins O
, O
those O
wane O
off O
, O
but O
they O
know O
where O
to O
go O
quickly O
. O

They O
also O
wear O
float O
coats O
. O

You O
can O
see O
them O
here O

The O

Everything O
is O

You O

to O
pull O

They O
also O
have O
a O

so O
if O
the O

they O
can O
blow O

trying O
to O
find O
or O

, O
let O
the O
rescuer O
locate O
them O
. O

Also O
24 B-CARDINAL
/ O

there O
are O
individuals O
on O
watch O
, O
all O
throughout O
the O
ship O
, O
all O
around O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
indeed O
, O
there O
is O
netting O
on O
most O
parts O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
not O
on O
entire O
all O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
, O
but O
on O
most O
parts O
there O
is O
a O
very O
thick O
netting O
. O

Now O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
man O
overboard O
rescue O
and O
when O
indeed O
there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
situation O
. O

You O
will O
hear O
a O
P.A. O
announcement O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
, O
there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
so O
everyone O
knows O
they O
have O
to O
react O
quickly O
. O

A O
ship O
- O
wide O
search O
will O
happen O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
person O
go O
overboard O
, O
but O
if O
indeed O
they O
do O
see O
someone O
go O
overboard O
, O
the O
ship O
starts O
to O
circle O
that O
area O
continuously O
. O

Also O
small O
boats O
sometimes O
go O
out O
into O
the O
water O
, O
but O
even O
more O
importantly O
, O
helicopters O
are O
launched O
immediately O
. O

Inside O
those O
helicopters O
rescue O
swimmers O
. O

If O
indeed O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
located O
, O
well O
the O
hoister O
is O
dropped O
down O
with O
usually O
a O
torso O
harness O
. O

If O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
injured O
then O
they O
may O
use O
a O
basket O
, O
but O
more O
than O
likely O
those O
swimmers O
will O
go O
right O
into O
the O
water O
and O
try O
and O
help O
the O
swimmer O
hook O
up O
on O
that O
harness O
and O
pull O
them O
up O
into O
the O
helo O
and O
pull O
them O
back O
on O
to O
the O
ship O
for O
treatment O
and O
usually O
a O
search O
takes O
about B-TIME
24 I-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

The O
search O
crews O
will O
go O
24 B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
calling O
off O
that O
search O
. O

Why O
call O
it O
off O
? O

There O
's O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
to O
look O
at O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
water O
temperature O
, O
it O
's O
very O
possible O
that O
or O
very O
common O
in O
cold O
water O
that O
someone O
will O
not O
survive O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

Also O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
24 B-TIME
- I-TIME
hour I-TIME
search O
is O
they O
fail O
they O
've O
exhausted O
all O
resources O
by O
that O
time O

the O

whether O

However O
, O
just O
the O

, O
various O

were O
still O

Daukoru B-PERSON
said O
on O
the O

that O
this O
conference O
would O
determine O
the O
OPEC B-ORG
crude O
oil O
production O
policy O
for O
the O
next O
stage O
. O

OPEC B-ORG
may O
decide O
to O
continue O
reducing O
production O
, O
but O
the O
rate O
of O
reduction O
will O
depend O
on O
oil O
prices O
and O
levels O
of O
inventories O
. O

Daukoru B-PERSON
said O
that O
OPEC B-ORG
will O
try O
its O
best O
to O
maintain O
stability O
in O
oil O
production O
so O
as O
to O
balance O
the O
relationship O
between O
oil O
supply O
and O
demand O
. O

Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
, O
the O
largest O
OPEC B-ORG
oil O
producing O
country O
, O
has O
always O
voted O
in O
favor O
of O
production O
reduction O
. O

However O
, O
Libya B-ORG
, O
Kuwait B-ORG
, O
and O
other O
member O
states O
believe O
that O
the O
current O
international O
oil O
price O
has O
been O
stabilized O
at O
above O
60 B-QUANTITY
US I-QUANTITY
dollars I-QUANTITY
per O

, O
approaching O
the O
balance O
of O
market O
supply O
and O

Under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
for O
OPEC B-ORG
to O
continue O
reducing O
production O
. O

In O
October B-DATE

this I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
in O
response O
to O
the O
prospect O
of O
continuous O

in O

, O
OPEC B-ORG
held O
a O
special O
ministerial O

reduce O

1.2 B-CARDINAL

it O
did O
not O

Every O

that O

always O

they O
have O
bucked O

the O

At O

the O

They O
were O
rescued O
by O
a O
cruise O

that O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

Those O
three B-CARDINAL
men O
did O
n't O
realize O
how O
lucky O
they O
were O
until O
they O
were O
plucked O
out O
of O

an O

, O
and O
it O
came O
from O

and O
we O
got O
the O
alarm O
this O
distress O
situation O
just B-TIME
before I-TIME
5:00 I-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning I-TIME
, O
and O
we O
were O
on O
relatively O
slow O

for O
the O
time O
being O
, O
but O
we O
of O
course O
, O
speeded O
up O
to O
the O
position O
, O
which O
was O
given O
, O
and O
we O
-- O
after O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
, O
we O
spotted O
the O
fishing O
boat O
in O
the O
waters O
. O

These O
men O
were O
in O
some O
water O
that O
was O
quite O
frigid O
. O

If O
they O
stayed O
out O
there O
for O
long O
they O
could O
have O
suffered O
severe O
tragedy O
, O
perhaps O
. O

I O
want O
to O
ask O
you O
, O
Have O
you O
ever O
done O
anything O
like O
this O
? O
Have O
you O
ever O
seen O
anything O
like O
this O
done O
? O

No O
, O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
this O
type O
of O
operation O
where O
you O
have O
a O
fishing O
vessel O
disappear O
, O
more O
or O
less O
, O
and O
that O
the O
survivors O
, O
they O
had O
to O
go O
into O
the O
water O
, O
pick O
them O
up O
from O
the O
water O
. O

Was O
there O
any O
point O
at O
which O
you O
did O
n't O
think O
you O
would O
be O
able O
to O
pull O
it O
off O
? O

Sorry O
, O
please O
say O
again O
? O

Was O
there O
any O
point O
at O
which O
you O
thought O
you O
would O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
pull O
it O
off O
? O

No O
, O
absolutely O
not O
. O

We O
-- O
we O
were O
100 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
sure O
we O
could O
make O
it O
, O
absolutely O
, O
because O
we O
came O
very O
close O
to O
the O
vessel O
, O
we O
had O
our O
rescue O
boat O
out O
soon O
. O

So O
I O
felt O
confident O
about O
it O
. O

I O
saw O
the O
fishermen O
also O
had O
the O
surviving O
suits O
on O
, O
so O
that O
gave O
me O
more O
time O
to O
help O
. O

That O
was O
a O
good O
thing O
for O
them O
. O

What O
about O
your O
crew O
that O
was O
actually O
involved O
in O
the O
rescue O
here O
? O
are O
they O
trained O
for O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
? O

Yes O
, O
they O
are O
very O
much O
well O
- O
trained O
. O

We O
train O
for O
this O
type O
of O
operation O
at O
least O
every O
14 B-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

I O
'm O
hopeful O
those O
three B-CARDINAL
fishermen O
bought O
you O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
once O
you O
got O
them O
on O
board O
. O

We O
gave O
them O
some O
. O

These O
incredible O
pictures O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
you O
have O
been O
able O
to O
see O
some O
of O
these O
pictures O
playing O
on O
the O
television O
sets O
around O
the O
world O
but O
we O
look O
at O
these O
pictures O
and O
think O
there O
's O
no O
way O
a O
cruise O
ship O
, O
as O
big O
as O
it O
is O
, O
will O
be O
able O

these O
kinds O
of O

to O
save O
three B-CARDINAL

out O

much O

And O
a O

devoted O
to O
efforts O
to O
get O
rid O
of O

Surprisingly O
, O
Shane B-ORG
Longman I-ORG
survives O
the B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
only O
to O
have O
a O
senior O
executive O
innocently O
bumble O
his O
way O
into O
becoming O
the O
target O
of O
a O
criminal O
insider O
trading O
investigation O
. O

Instead O
of O
closing O
ranks O
to O
protect O
the O
firm O
's O
reputation O
, O
the O
executive O
's O
internal O
rivals O
, O
led O
by O
a O
loutish O
American B-NORP
, O
demand O
his O
resignation O
. O

The O
plot O
is O
thwarted O
when O
the O

major O
stockholder O
, O
kelp O
farming O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
globe O
, O
hurries O
home O
to O
support O
the O
executive O
. O

But O
the O
investigation O
continues O
. O

If O
you O
can O
swallow O
the O
premise O
that O
the O
rewards O
for O
such O
ineptitude O
are O
six B-CARDINAL

you O
still O
are O
left O
puzzled O
, O
because O
few O
of O

consume O
very O
conspicuously O

In O
fact O
, O

And O
it O
takes O

, O
the O

of O
the O

until O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
episode O
to O
get O
past O
first B-ORDINAL
base O
with O
any O
of O
his O
prey O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
explanation O
for O
these O
anomalies O
is O
that O
class O

conscious O
Britain B-GPE
is O
n't O
ready O
to O
come O
to O
terms O
with O
the O
wealth O
created O
by O
the O
Thatcherian O

. O

After O
all O
, O
this O
is O
n't O
old O
money O
, O
but O
new O
money O
, O
and O
in O
many O
cases O

This O
attitude O
is O
clearly O

in O
the O

But O
apparently O
to O
make O
him O
palatable O
, O
even O

, O
to O
the O

, O
the O

Your O
comments O
implied O
we O
had O
discovered O
that O
the O
`` O
principal O
cause O
'' O
of O
homelessness O
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
large O
numbers O
of O

and O
substance O

abusing O

in O

We O
have O
made O
no O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
most O
mentally O
ill O
people O
and O
most O
alcoholics O
do O
not O
become O
homeless O
. O

The O
`` O
causes O
'' O
of O
homelessness O
are O
poorly O
understood O
and O
complex O
in O
any O
individual O
case O
. O

In O
quoting O
from O
our O
research O
you O
emphasized O
the O
high O
prevalance O
of O
mental O
illness O
and O
alcoholism O
. O

You O
did O
not O
note O
that O
the O
homeless O
people O
we O
examined O
had O
a O
multitude O
of O
physical O
disorders O
in O
addition O
to O
their O
psychiatric O
problems O
and O
substance O
abuse O
. O

They O
suffered O
from O
malnutrition O

, O
cardiovascular O
disorders O
, O
skin O
problems O
, O
infectious O
diseases O
and O
the O

assaults O
and O

. O

Homeless O
people O
not O
only O
lack O
safety O
, O
privacy O
and O
shelter O
, O
they O
also O
lack O
the O
elementary O
necessities O
of O
nutrition O
, O
cleanliness O
and O
basic O
health O
care O
. O

In O
a O
recent O
report O
, O
the B-ORG
Institute I-ORG
of I-ORG
Medicine I-ORG
pointed O
out O
that O
certain O
health O
problems O
may O
predispose O
a O
person O
to O
homelessness O
, O
others O
may O
be O
a O
consequence O
of O
it O
, O
and O
a O
third B-ORDINAL
category O
is O
composed O
of O
disorders O
whose O
treatment O
is O
difficult O
or O
impossible O
if O
a O
person O
lacks O
adequate O
shelter O
. O

The O
interactions O
between O
health O
and O
homelessness O
are O
complex O
, O
defying O
sweeping O
generalizations O
as O
to O
`` O
cause O
'' O
or O
`` O
effect O
. O
'' O

If O
we O
look O
to O
the O
future O
, O
preventing O
homelessness O
is O
an O
important O
objective O
. O

This O
will O
require O
us O
to O
develop O
a O
much O
more O
sophisticated O
understanding O
of O
the O
dynamics O
of O
homelessness O
than O
we O
currently O
possess O
, O
an O
understanding O
that O
can O
be O

only O

'' O

One B-CARDINAL
obvious O
place O
to O
attach O

cut O
, O
and O
perhaps O
other O
popular O
items O
stripped O
from O
the O
deficit O
- O
reduction O
bill O
, O
is O
the O
legislation O
to O
raise O
the O

Such O

must O
be O
enacted O
by O
the B-DATE

The O
Senate B-ORG
bill O
was O
pared O
back O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
speed O
deficit O
- O
reduction O
through O
Congress B-ORG
. O

Because O
the O
legislation O

President O

until O

by O
the O

Senators O
hope O
that O
the O
need O
to O
avoid O
those O
cuts O
will O
pressure O
the O
House B-ORG
to O
agree O
to O
the O
streamlined O
bill O
. O

The O
House B-ORG
appears O
reluctant O
to O
join O
the O
senators O
. O

A O
key O
is O
whether O
House B-ORG
Republicans B-NORP
are O
willing O
to O
acquiesce O
to O
their O
Senate B-ORG
colleagues O
' O
decision O
to O
drop O

'' O

Another O
big O
question O
hovering O
over O
the O

is O
what O
President O

thinks O

He O
has O
been O
resisting O
a O
stripped O

down O
bill O
without O
a O
guaranteed O
vote O
on O
his O
capital O
- O
gains O
tax O
cut O

saw O
no O
way O

garner O

60 B-CARDINAL

needed O
to O
win O
the O
capital O

on O
the O

so O
they O
went O
ahead O
with O
the O
streamlined O
bill O

The O
Senate B-ORG
bill O
was O
stripped O

many O

a O
number O

Also O
missing O

the O

Mr. O
Stoll B-PERSON
draws O
his O
title O
from O
the O
cuckoo O
's O
habit O
of O
laying O
eggs O
in O
the O
nests O
of O
other O
birds O
, O
making O
them O

. O

The O
computer O
spy O
had O
discovered O
that O
a O
popular O
editing O
/ O
electronic O
mail O
program O
called O
Gnu B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
Emacs I-PRODUCT
could O
do O
tricks O
with O
the O
widely O
used O
Unix O
operating O
system O
created O
by O
AT-AMP-T B-ORG
. O

Using O
Gnu B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
Emacs I-PRODUCT
, O
the O
spy O
could O
substitute O
a O
bogus O
`` O
atrun O
'' O
program O
for O
the O
one O
that O
routinely O
cleans O
up O
the O
Unix O
system O
every B-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
. O

Once O
his O
cuckoo O

egg O
was O
laid O
, O
he O
could O
enter O
Unix O
and O
become O
a O
`` O
super-user O
, O
'' O
with O
access O
to O
everything O
. O

Mr. O
Stoll B-PERSON
was O
scanning O
the O
heavens O
at O
the O
Keck B-PERSON
observatory O
of O
the B-ORG
Lawrence I-ORG
Berkeley I-ORG
Laboratory I-ORG
in O
1986 B-DATE
when O
his O
grant O
ran O
low O
and O
he O
was O
asked O
to O
switch O
to O
helping O
run O
the O
lab O
's O
computers O
. O

He O
discovered O
a O
75 B-MONEY
- I-MONEY
cent I-MONEY
discrepancy O
in O
the O
charges O
made O
to O
various O
departments O
for O
computer O
time O
and O
traced O
it O
to O
a O
user O
named O
`` O
Hunter B-PERSON
, O
'' O
who O
had O
no O
valid O
billing O
address O
. O

Mr. O
Stoll B-PERSON
suspected O
the O
intruder O
was O
one O
of O
those O
precocious O
students O
who O
has O
fun O
breaking O
into O
computers O
. O

But O
after O
much O
tracking O
, O
it O
became O
evident O
to O
Mr. O
Stoll B-PERSON
, O
through O
various O
clues O
, O
that O
the O
hacker O
was O
not O
on O
the O
Berkeley B-ORG
campus O
or O
even O
in O
California B-GPE
. O

Finding O
him O
became O
an O
obsession O
for O
Mr. O
Stoll B-PERSON
. O

He O
made O
a O
midnight B-TIME
requisition O
of O
all O
the O
printers O
he O
could O
lay O
hands O
on O
so O
that O
he O
could O
monitor O
all O
the O
telephone O
lines O
coming O
into O
the O
lab O
's O
computers O
. O

After O
discovering O
that O
the O
hacker O
had O
taken O
over O
the O
dormant O
account O
of O
a O
legitimate O
user O
named O
Joe B-PERSON
Sventek I-PERSON
, O
he O
rigged O
up O
an O
alarm O
system O
, O
including O
a O
portable O
beeper O
, O
to O
alert O
him O
when O
Sventek B-PERSON
came O
on O
the O
line O
. O

Some B-DATE
nights I-DATE
he O
slept O
under O
his O
desk O
. O

His O
boss O
complained O
about O
neglect O
of O
other O
chores O
. O

The O
hacker O
was O
pawing O
over O
the O
Berkeley B-ORG
files O
but O
also O
using O
Berkeley B-ORG
and O
other O
easily O
accessible O
computers O
as O
stepping O
stones O
to O
the O
network O
of O
computers O
used O
by O
the O
military O
and O
national O
security O
agencies O
. O

The O
White B-FAC
Sands I-FAC
missile O
range O
and O
CIA B-ORG
contractor O
Mitre B-ORG
Inc. I-ORG
were O
among O
the O
targets O
. O

When O
the O
hacker O
moved O
, O
Mr. O
Stoll B-PERSON
moved O
too O
, O
calling O
up O
other O
systems O
managers O
to O
alert O
them O
but O
keeping O
his O
own O
system O
open O
to O
avoid O
arousing O
suspicion O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
if O
the O
hacker O
seemed O
to O
be O
into O
a O
sensitive O
file O
, O
he O
would O
drag O
his O
keychain O
across O
the O
terminal O
to O
create O
static O
or O
slow O
the O
system O
down O
to O
frustrate O
his O
quarry O
. O

The O
FBI B-ORG
initially O
showed O
little O
interest O
, O
and O
he O
had O
the O
impression O
other O
federal O
security O
agencies O
were O
tangled O
up O
in O
legal O
red O
tape O
. O

The O
CIA B-ORG
told O
him O
it O
does O
not O
do O
domestic O
counterespionage O
. O

One O
learns O
a O
lot O
from O
this O
book O
, O
or O
seems O
to O
, O
about O
crippling O
federal O
bureaucracy O
. O

`` O
Seems O
to O
'' O
because O
it O
's O
possible O
that O
the O
CIA B-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
National I-ORG
Security I-ORG
Agency I-ORG
were O
more O
interested O
than O
they O
let O
on O
to O
Mr. O
Stoll B-PERSON
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
got O
help O
. O

Tymnet O
is O
a O
major O
network O
linking O
computers O
. O

One O
of O
its O
international O
specialists O
, O
Steve B-PERSON
White I-PERSON
, O
took O
a O
quick O
interest O
in O
Mr. O
Stoll B-PERSON
's O
hunt O
, O
ultimately O
tracing O
the O
hacker O
to O
West B-GPE
Germany I-GPE
. O

The B-NORP
West I-NORP
Germans I-NORP
then O
took O
over O
and O
finally O
found O
Markus B-PERSON
Hess I-PERSON
. O

Eventually O
, O
Mr. O
Stoll B-PERSON
was O
invited O
to O
both O
the O
CIA B-ORG
and O
NSA B-ORG
to O
brief O
high O
- O
ranking O
officers O
on O
computer O
theft O
. O

He O
savored O
the O
humor O
of O
his O
uncombed O
appearance O
among O
these O
buttoned O
- O
up O
chaps O
. O

Back O
in O
Berkeley B-GPE
, O
he O
was O
violently O
scolded O
by O
a O
left O
- O
wing O
lady O
friend O
for O
consorting O
with O
such O
people O
. O

He O
became O
angry O
in O
return O
. O

He O
had O
developed O
a O
hatred O
for O
the O
hacker O
and O
a O
grudging O
appreciation O
of O
the O
federal O
`` O
spooks O
'' O
who O
make O
national O
security O
their O
business O
. O

At O
several O
different O
levels O
, O
it O
's O
a O
fascinating O
tale O

it O

that O
the O
most O

element O
in O
predicting O

the O

Because O

can O
use O
an O

to O
finance O
all O

the O

Mr. O

appointed O

grew O
understandably O
tired O

His O

provocatively O
titled O
`` O
Blacks O

caused O

'' O

We O

actually O
read O
the O
speech O

Mr. O
Allen B-PERSON
began O
it O
with O
a O
warning O
to O
his O
hosts O
, O
a O
California B-GPE
church O
group O
that O
opposes O
rights O
for O
homosexuals O
. O

He O
said O
that O
other O
participants O
in O
the O
conference O
`` O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
the O

'' O
but O
that O
`` O
I O

the O
opposite O
view O

'' O

He O
recalled O
to O
the O
audience O
a O
`` O
strange O

infelicitous O
'' O
analogy O
he O
once O
heard O
arguing O
`` O
now O
that O
we O
have O

recognized O
that O

do O
the O

for O

'' O
Mr. O
Allen B-PERSON
objected O
to O
this O
analogy O
because O
it O
seems O
to O
`` O
assimilate O
the O

whether O

`` O

'' O
he O
said O
, O
subject O
to O
being O
taken O
back O
. O

He O
says O
the O
title O
of O
his O
speech O
was O
to O
make O
his O
point O
that O

Instead O
of O
lobbying O
for O
special O

, O
Mr. O
Allen B-PERSON
said O
that O
homosexuals O

should O
try O
to O
ensure O
equal O

under O
the O

not O
aim O

This O
hardly O
sounds O
like O
an O
anti-homosexual O
screed O
. O

What O
's O
really O
going O
on O
here O
? O

The O
three B-CARDINAL
most O
important O
things O
to O
understand O
about O
Mr. O
Allen B-PERSON
is O
that O
he O
is O
a O
black O
conservative O
intellectual O
-- O
a O
triple O
threat O
to O
the O
liberal O
establishment O
. O

Mr. O
Allen B-PERSON
, O
who O
teaches O
government O
at O
prestigious O
Harvey B-ORG
Mudd I-ORG
College I-ORG
in O
California B-GPE
and O
will O
remain O
a O
member O
of O
the O
commission O
, O
has O
spent O
years B-DATE
arguing O
that O
civil O
rights O
are O
individuals O
' O
rights O
. O

He O
last O
made O
waves O
when O
he O
dared O
to O
defend O
an O
Indian B-NORP
girl O
who O
had O
been O
adopted O
by O
non-Indian B-NORP
parents O
off O
her O
reservation O
. O

Mr. O
Allen B-PERSON
quickly O
ran O
up O
against O
the O
liberal O
establishment O
again O
, O
which O
somehow O
elevated O
the O
vague O
concept O
of O
`` O
Indian B-NORP
rights O
'' O
above O
the O
rights O
of O
individual O
Indians B-NORP
. O

There O
is O
a O
huge O
divide O
between O
Mr. O
Allen B-PERSON
's O
we O
're O
- O
all O
- O
in O
- O
this O
- O
together O
view O
and O
the O
divisive O
litigation O
approach O
of O
the O
civil O
rights O
groups O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
gap O
is O
so O
large O
that O
Mr. O
Allen B-PERSON
's O
critics O
refuse O
to O
engage O
the O
debate O
. O

Their O
ridicule O
of O
him O
is O
no O
substitute O
for O
argument O
. O

Their O
effort O
to O
run O
him O
out O
of O
Washington B-GPE
is O
an O
embarrassment O
to O
the O
original O
purpose O
of O
their O
own O
movement O
. O

We O
hope O
the O
next O

will O
be O

Is O
it O
Really O
Healthy O
to O
Drink O
Milk O
on O
Empty O
Stomach O
? O

Healthy B-PERSON
and I-PERSON
happy I-PERSON

Protein O
will O
be O
wasted O
to O
drinking O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
? O

Some O
say O
drinking O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
will O
consume O
the O
protein O
wastefully O
as O
energy O
, O

but O
actually O
milk O
contains O
about O
45 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
lactose O
, O
which O
is O
carbohydrate O
that O
will O
decompose O
first B-ORDINAL
to O
supply O
energy O
and O
save O
protein O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
milk O
also O
contains O
about O
3 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
fat O
, O
which O
also O
plays O
the O
role O
of O
supplying O
energy O
. O

Therefore O
, O
drinking O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
will O
not O
lead O
to O
protein O
waste O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
infants O
under O
the O
age O
of O
one B-CARDINAL
can O
drink O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
and O
absorb O
nutrients O
proves O
that O
milk O
contains O
a O
variety O
of O
nutrients O
that O
can O
be O
fully O
used O
by O
the O
human O
body O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
digestion O
rate O
will O
be O
slightly O
lowered O
, O
it O
is O
healthier O
to O
drink O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
than O
to O
eat O
nothing O
the O
whole O
morning O
when O
there O
is O
no O
time O
for O
breakfast O
. O

Tip O
: O
drink O
boiled O
water O
before O
milk O
. O

It O
is O
not O
appropriate O
to O
take O
milk O
as O
the O
only O
drink O
in O
the B-TIME
early I-TIME
morning I-TIME
. O

When O
you O
get O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
it O
's O
better O
to O
drink O
a O
big O
glass O
of O
boiled O
water O
-LRB- O
light O
honey O
water O
is O
better O
in O
case O
of O
a O
dry O
indoor O
environment O
during O
the O
heating O
season O
-RRB- O
before O
consuming O
milk O
. O

As O
milk O
has O
higher O
osmotic O
pressure O
, O
it O
is O
far O
less O
quick O
and O
effective O
compared O
to O
boiled O
water O
in O
terms O
of O
supplying O
moisture O
. O

Who O
can O
not O
drink O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
? O

What O
needs O
our O
attention O
is O
that O
if O
there O
are O
abdominal O
distention O
or O
diarrhea O
after O
drinking O
milk O
, O
it O
is O
then O
indeed O
inappropriate O
to O
drink O
a O
lot O
of O
milk O
with O
on O
empty O
stomach O
. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
have O
some O
starchy O
food O
before O
you O
drink O
milk O
in O
multiple O
small O
serves O
, O
and O
it O
is O
better O
to O
have O
yogurt O
. O

Experts O
said O
milk O
can O
not O
be O
consumed O
on O
empty O
stomach O
20 B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
because O
Chinese B-NORP
had O
few O
chances O
to O
drink O
milk O
. O

Once O
they O
were O
weaned O
from O
breast O
milk O
, O
they O
hardly O
saw O
any O
dairy O
products O
. O

Long O
- O
term O
separation O
from O
dairy O
products O
led O
to O
" O
lactose O
intolerance O
" O
of O
the O
body O
. O

People O
suffered O
abdominal O
distention O
, O
diarrhea O
or O
dyspepsia O
whenever O
they O
drink O
milk O
. O

If O
they O
drink O
too O
fast O
, O
especially O
drinking O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
, O
the O
symptom O
would O
exacerbate O
. O

Now O
time O
is O
different O
, O
and O
the O
diet O
pattern O
has O
also O
changed O
. O

Many O
children O
and O
young O
people O
often O
consume O
milk O
, O
yogurt O
, O
ice O
cream O
and O
even O
cheese O
since O
childhood O
, O
which O
bring O
them O
strong O
ability O
to O
digest O
milk O
lactose O
. O

Even O
if O
they O
drink O
milk O
on O
empty O
stomach O
, O
they O
will O
not O
feel O
uncomfortable O
. O

So O
, O
the O
so O
- O
called O
remark O
of O
" O
no O
milk O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
" O
should O
be O
changed O
, O
at O
least O
with O
a O
premise O
added O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
generalized O

, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
what O
some O
of O
our O
exit O
polling O
data O
seems O
to O
suggest O
. O

As O
far O
as O
a O
gender O
gap O
, O
voters O
who O
said O
they O
voted O
for O
Mrs. O

, O
58 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
them O
women O
, O
47 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
men O

Now O
on O
the O
big O
issue O
the O
people O
thought O
would O
be O
the O
heart O
of O
this O
race O
, O
the O
notion O
that O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
was O
accused O
of O
being O
a O
carpet O
bagger O
, O
a O
woman O
born O
in O
Illinois B-GPE
, O
made O
much O
of O
her O
professional O
life O
in O
Arkansas B-GPE
and O
of O
of O
course O
has O
been O
living O
in O
Washington B-GPE
until O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
voters O
said O
52 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
them O
, O
that O
that O
issue O
did O
not O
matter O
to O
them O
at O
all O
. O

Also O
an O
important O
constituency O
for O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
, O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
vote O
. O

It O
appears O
she O
has O
earned O
58 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
vote O
. O

This O
has O
been O
a O
tough O
race O
, O
too O
, O
where O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
, O
the O
congressman O
of O
eight B-DATE
years I-DATE
from O
Long B-LOC
Island I-LOC
was O
accused O
of O
being O
much O
more O
tough O
as O
a O
campaigner O
-- O

A O
lot O
of O
mud O
was O
slung O
on O
both O
sides O
of O
this O
race O
, O
but O
when O
voters O
were O
questioned O
about O
that O
, O
they O
said O
-- O
68 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
that O
Mr. O
Lazio B-PERSON
attacked O
unfairly O
, O
and O
57 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
said O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
did O
. O

So O
that O
's O
some O
of O
the O
picture O
that O
makes O
up O
the O
results O
tonight O
that O
sent O
Hillary B-PERSON
Rodham I-PERSON

Brian B-PERSON

All O
right O
, O
Kelly B-PERSON
O'Donnell I-PERSON
, O
thank O
you O
very O
much O

And O
about O
just O
how O
this O
vote O
went O
the O
way O
it O
did O
tonight B-TIME
in O
New B-GPE

, O
Forrest B-PERSON
Sawyer I-PERSON
standing O

a O

the O

really O
. O

Forrest B-PERSON
? O

A O
few O
more O
of O
those O
numbers O
Kelly B-PERSON
was O
talking O
about O
for O
you O
to O
look O
at O
, O
Brian B-PERSON
. O

As O
she O
mentioned O
, O
men O
and O
women O
did O
split O
their O
vote O
. O

Let O
's O
look O
at O
Jewish B-NORP
voters O
. O

New B-NORP
Yorkers I-NORP
know O
that O
this O
was O
a O
huge O
battle O
over O
support O
for O
Israel B-GPE
and O
whether O
the O
support O
for O
Palestine B-GPE
was O
strong O
enough O
. O

As O
you O
look O
at O
this O
, O
though O
, O
Jewish B-NORP
voters O
went O
by O
a O
big O
margin O
for O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
. O

58 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
to O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
41 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

New B-NORP
Yorkers I-NORP
remember O
the O
campaign O
debate O
where O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
walked O
over O
to O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
and O
said O
you O
're O
going O
to O
sign O
this O
pledge O
about O
campaign O
moneys O
, O
you O
're O
going O
to O
sign O
it O
. O

That O
. O

Was O
she O
attacked O
unfairly O
, O
68 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
did O
say O
yes O
. O

57 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
went O
for O
Clinton B-PERSON
, O
and O
as O
for O
Lazio B-PERSON
's O
voters O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
said O
this O
was O
a O
campaign O
about O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
. O

Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
is O
this O
other O
guy O
. O

In O
fact O
they O
asked O
of O
his O
voters O
, O
how O
many O
voted O
against O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
-- O

50 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
said O
we O
're O
voting O
against O
her O
, O
we O
're O
not O
voting O
for O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
, O
we O
're O
voting O
against O
Senate B-ORG
Hillary B-PERSON
, O
and O
that O
shows O
you O
that O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
as O
Chris B-PERSON
pointed O
out O
, O
she O
really O
is O
a O
tremendous O
lightning O
rod O
. O

This O
campaign O
was O
about O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
, O
do O
you O
like O
her O
or O
do O
you O
not O
. O

Scombrort O
of O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
voters O
were O
voting O
for O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
, O
not O
against O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
, O
and O
on O
the O
which O
one O
attacked O
the O
other O
more O
unfairly O
, O
the O
voters O
said O
that O
Lazio B-PERSON
attacked O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
more O
unfairly O
, O
and O
that O
possibly O
played O
into O
the O
gap O
in O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
vote O
, O
which O
is O
heavily O
in O
favor O
of O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
scene O
that O
you O
mentioned O
, O
the O
debate O
, O
where O
Lazio B-PERSON
was O
-- O
invaded O
her O
space O
, O
as O
they O
say O
, O
he O
hit O
very O
hard O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
on O
issues O
involved O
in O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
. O

The O
Republican B-NORP
campaign O
, O
not O
directly O
through O
Lazio B-PERSON
, O
but O
others O
was O
actually O
associating O
in O
certain O
ways O
Mrs. O
Clinton B-PERSON
's O
sympathies O
with O
the O
Arab B-NORP
sides O
in O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
with O
the O
attack O
on O
the O
battle O
ship O
Cole B-PRODUCT
. O

It O
got O
out O
of O
hand O
and O
so O
this O
vote O
could O
well O
be O
as O
much O
a O
rejection O
of O
the O
Lazio B-PERSON
campaign O
as O
it O
is O
also O
a O
very O
positive O
setting O
about O
Hillary B-PERSON
's O
numbers O
, O
and O
you O
remember O
after O
Rick B-PERSON
Lazio I-PERSON
had O
pressed O
her O
right O
in O
front O
of O
the O
debate O
crowd O
, O
they O
said O
What O
do O
you O
think O
of O
this O
and O
women O
said O
It O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
husband O
or O
in O
some O
cases O
my O
ex-husband O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
and O
we O
see O
that O
women O
and O
particularly O
working O
women O
went O
by O
a O
large O
measure O
for O
Hillary B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
, O
and O
Lawrence B-PERSON
, O
there O
is O
this O
as O
well O
. O

Opinions O
about O
her O
husband O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
important O
in O
voters O

Among O
those O
who O
disapprove O
of O
her O

won O

and O
it O
's O
certainly O
a O
different O
kind O
of O

from O
the O

races O
we O

that O

" O

Indeed O
, O
as O
consumers O
men O
are O
often O
easier O
to O

as O
they O

When O

In O
the O
view O
of O
Betty B-PERSON
Wu I-PERSON
, O
the O
reason O
men O
are O
daring O
to O
enter O
the O
ranks O
of O
beauty O
lovers O
, O
and O
even O
accept O
softer O

more O

standards O

, O
is O
because O
expectations O

Thus O
they O
no O

are O
looking O
for O
someone O
who O
" O
walks O

like O
a O
real O
man O

" O

In O
the O
past O
, O
the O
definition O

a O

the O

Looking O

the O

greater O
youthfulness O
in O

can O
be O
traced O

In O

notes O
that O
in O
this O
generation O
people O
are O
increasingly O
forced O
into O
situations O
in O
which O
appearance O
matters O
- O
for O
example O
, O
on O
the O
lecture O
podium O
, O
or O
in O
front O
of O
the O
TV O

or O
the O
camera O

. O

People O
need O
a O
greater O
sense O
of O
self O
- O
confidence O
, O
and O
feel O
more O
and O
more O
uncomfortable O
with O
their O
bodies O
. O

So O
they O
strive O
more O
and O
more O
to O
recover O
lost O
confidence O
by O
enhancing O
their O
external O
appearance O
. O

" O
If O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
looks O
, O
and O
you O
ca O
n't O
dress O
well O
, O
you O
wo O
n't O
even O
be O
able O
to O
find O
a O
job O
as O
a O
clerk O
in O
a O

which O
is O
ranked O
as O
one O
of O
the O

" O

Go O

you O
wo O
n't O
find O
any O
ugly O

working O
there O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
lot O
of O
discrimination O
in O
our O
society O
based O
on O
appearance O
. O

It O
is O
not O
only O
the O
young O
who O
want O
to O
look O
better O
, O
and O
it O
seems O
the O
attitudes O
of O
the O
kids O
are O
affecting O
their O
elders O
at O
home O
. O

Besides O
supporting O
their O
families O
, O
guys O
in O
their O
40s B-DATE

also O
starting O
to O
worry O
about O
whether O
they O
are O
looking O
old O
, O
and O
whether O
their O
beer O

guts O
are O
starting O
to O
show O

So O
they O
too O
are O
joining O
the O
ranks O
of O
those O
seeking O
cosmetic O

treatments O

In O

Western B-NORP

the O

Thus O
a O

" O

The O

that O

, O

that O

The O
rapidity O
with O
which O

Last B-DATE

, O
a O
survey O

that O
the O

concerned O
about O

' O

" O

The O
Foundation B-ORG

suggested O
explanation O
is O
that O
these O

were O
focused O
on O
their O

when O

were O
younger O
, O
and O
they O
are O
only O
turning O
their O

they O
get O
older O

The O
new O
generation O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
strikes O
a O
balance O
between O
career O
and O
appearance O
. O

This O
is O
not O
necessarily O
a O
bad O
thing O
. O

In O
the O
eyes O
of O

, O
the O
arrival O

the O
era O
of O

preening O

added O
a O
number O

interesting O
possibilities O
to O
the O
game O
of O
mutual O
admiration O
between O
the O

. O

But O
besides O
lustful O
appreciation O
there O
is O
a O
deeper O
question O
: O

Do O
the O
" O
peacocks O
" O
who O
have O
been O
influenced O
in O
part O
by O
feminist O
consciousness O
" O
have O
any O

The O

The B-ORG

proposed O
that O

which O

believe O

the O

to O
move O
billions B-MONEY

In O

Another O

draw O

which O

would O
use O

spotlight O

But O
banks O
may O
prefer O
using O
a O
profile O
that O
targets O
selected O
transactions O

rather O
than O
a O
blanket O
reporting O
requirement O
. O

Banks O
now O
are O

only O

those O

Some O
U.S. B-GPE
allies O
are O
complaining O
that O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
is O
pushing O
conventional O
- O
arms O
talks O
too O
quickly O
, O
creating O
a O
risk O
that O
negotiators O
will O
make O
errors O
that O
could O
affect O
the O
security O
of O
Western B-LOC
Europe I-LOC
for O

. O

Concerns O
about O
the O
pace O
of O
the O
Vienna B-GPE
talks O
-- O
which O
are O
aimed O
at O
the O
destruction O
of O
some B-CARDINAL
100,000 I-CARDINAL
weapons O
, O
as O
well O
as O
major O
reductions O
and O
realignments O
of O
troops O
in O
central O
Europe B-LOC
-- O
also O
are O
being O
registered O
at O
the O
Pentagon B-ORG
. O

Mr. O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
called O
for O
an O
agreement O
by O
next B-DATE
September I-DATE
at O
the O
latest O
. O

But O
some O
American B-NORP
defense O
officials O
believe O
the B-ORG
North I-ORG
Atlantic I-ORG
Treaty I-ORG
Organization I-ORG
should O
take O
more O
time O
to O
examine O
the O
long O

term O
implications O
of O
the O
options O
being O
considered O
. O

For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
Pentagon B-ORG
officials O
, O
who O
asked O
not O
to O
be O
identified O
, O
worry O
that O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
will O
have O
a O
much O
tougher O
time O
persuading O
Europeans B-NORP
to O
keep O
some O
short O
- O
range O
nuclear O
weapons O
on O
their O
soil O
once O
Soviet B-NORP
armored O
forces O
are O
thinned O
out O
. O

At O
the B-DATE
same I-DATE
time I-DATE
, O
they O
contend O
that O
a O
reduction O
of O
NATO B-ORG
forces O
under O
a O
treaty O
will O
increase O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
conventional O
Soviet B-NORP
attack O
unless O
the O
West O
retains O
a O
residual O
force O
of O
nuclear O
weapons O
in O
Europe B-LOC
. O

Allies O
concerned O
about O
the O
deadline O
include O
the O
British B-NORP
, O
French B-NORP
and O
smaller O
NATO B-ORG
allies O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
do O
n't O
have O
adequate O
staffs O
to O
provide O
quick O
answers O
to O
the O
questions O
being O
raised O
by O
what O
generally O
are O
considered O
the O
most O
complex O
arms O
- O
control O
talks O
ever O
attempted O
. O

So O
far O
, O
no O
ally O
has O
complained O
openly O
, O
preserving O
the O
impression O
that O
NATO B-ORG
is O
in O
line O
with O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
position O
that O
a O
quick O
agreement O
bringing O
Soviet B-NORP
conventional O
forces O
down O
to O
parity O
with O
NATO B-ORG
is O
the O
West O
's O
top O
bargaining O
priority O
. O

But O
even O
though O
NATO B-ORG
negotiators O
have O
only B-DATE
10 I-DATE
months I-DATE
left O
under O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
timetable O
, O
they O
are O
still O
wrestling O
over O
such O
seemingly O
fundamental O
questions O
as O
`` O
What O
is O
a O
tank O
? O
'' O

Five B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
categories O
of O
weapons O
under O
negotiation O
have O
n't O
even O
been O
defined O
. O

Tanks O
currently O
are O
defined O
as O
armored O
vehicles O
weighing O
25 B-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
or O
more O
that O
carry O
large O
guns O
. O

The O
Soviets B-NORP
complicated O
the O
issue O
by O
offering O
to O
include O
light O
tanks O
, O
which O
are O
as B-QUANTITY
light I-QUANTITY
as I-QUANTITY
10 I-QUANTITY
tons I-QUANTITY
. O

Oleg B-PERSON
A. I-PERSON
Grinevsky I-PERSON
, O
the O
chief O
Soviet B-NORP
negotiator O
in O
the O
conventional O
- O
arms O
talks O
, O
argued O
that O
this O
would O
mean O
the O
Soviets B-NORP
would O
have O
to O
destroy O
some B-CARDINAL
1,800 I-CARDINAL
tanks O
, O
while O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
would O
lose O
none O
because O
it O
has O
no O
light O
tanks O
in O
Europe B-LOC
. O

But O
the O
issue O
is O
stickier O
than O
it O
seems O
. O

France B-GPE
, O
Britain B-GPE
and O
Italy B-GPE
all O
have O
light O
tanks O
they O
would O
like O
to O
keep O
out O
of O
the O
talks O
. O

And O
some O
U.S. B-ORG
Army I-ORG
analysts O
worry O
that O
the O
proposed O
Soviet B-NORP
redefinition O
is O
aimed O
at O
blocking O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
from O
developing O
lighter O
, O
more O
transportable O
, O
high O
- O
technology O
tanks O
. O

Defining O
combat O
aircraft O
is O
even O
tougher O
. O

The O
Soviets B-NORP
insisted O
that O
aircraft O
be O
brought O
into O
the O
talks O
, O
then O
argued O
for O
exempting O
some B-CARDINAL
4,000 I-CARDINAL
Russian B-NORP
planes O
because O
they O
are O
`` O
solely O
defensive O
. O
'' O

NATO B-ORG
has O
n't O
budged O
from O
its O
insistence O
that O
any O
gun O
- O
carrying O
plane O
has O
offensive O
capability O
. O

The O
dispute O
over O
that O
issue O
, O
according O
to O
one O
U.S. B-GPE
official O
, O
is O
a O
`` O
potential O
treaty O
stopper O
, O
'' O
and O
only O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
and O
Soviet B-NORP
leader O
Mikhail B-PERSON
Gorbachev I-PERSON
may O
be O
able O
to O
resolve O
it O
. O

Accounting O
problems O
raise O
more O
knotty O
issues O
. O

Greece B-GPE
and O
Turkey B-GPE
, O
for O
example O
, O
are O
suspected O
of O
overstating O
their O
arsenals O
in O
hopes O
that O
they O
can O
emerge O
from O
the O
arms O
- O
reduction O

with O
large O
remaining O

to O
deter O
each O

Other O

sure O
how O
many O

have O
in O

says O

So O
far O
, O
neither O
the O

experts O
in O
Congress B-ORG
seem O
moved O
by O
arguments O
that O
these O
problems O
may O
take O
more O
time O
to O
thrash O
out O
than O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
has O
allowed O
. O

They O
argue O
that O
the O
bigger O
danger O
would O
be O
that O
the O
West O
would O
delay O
action O
so O
long O
that O
the O

about O
the O
experiment O
in O
Stockholm B-GPE
, O
Sweden B-GPE
, O
with O
congestion O
pricing O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
Swedes B-NORP
, O
for O
all O
their O
skill O
in O
urban O
planning O
and O
their O
investments O
in O
mass O
transit O
, O
are O
suffering O
from O
traffic O
congestion O
. O

Better O
yet O
, O
they O
're O
adopting O
a O
market O
- O
driven O
remedy O
. O

Socialist O
though O
they O
may O
be O
, O
Sweden B-GPE
's O
politicians O
apparently O
have O
a O
firmer O
grasp O
of O
economics O
than O
Virginia B-GPE
's O
. O

The O
Greater B-LOC
Stockholm I-LOC
region O
has O
nearly B-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
. O

The O
central O
city O
, O
built O
upon O
an O
archipelago O
of O
islands O
linked O
by O
bridges O
, O
is O
particularly O
prone O
to O
congestion O
. O

Under O
contract O
with O
IBM B-ORG
, O
the O
national O
government O
has O
set O
up O
23 B-CARDINAL
tolling O
points O
which O
, O
used O
in O
conjunction O
with O
transponder O
boxes O
, O
laser O
detectors O
and O
cameras O
, O
tracks O
the O
path O
of O
every O
car O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Each O
time O
a O
car O
with O
a O
transponder O
passes O
through O
a O
toll O
, O
the O
charge O
is O
automatically O
deducted O
from O
the O
driver O
's O
bank O
account O
. O

Tolls O
vary O
at O
different O
times O
of O
the O
day O
according O
to O
the O
level O
of O
congestion O
, O
ranging O
from O
the O
equivalent O
of O
$ B-MONEY
1.38 I-MONEY
to O
$ O
2.76 B-MONEY
per O
hour O
. O

The O
goal O
was O
to O
alter O
motorist O
behavior O
-- O
and O
that O
's O
exactly O
what O
has O
happened O
. O

Rather O
than O
drive O
to O
and O
from O
work O
at O
the O
same O
time O
every O
day O
, O
some O
Stockholmites B-NORP
-LRB- O
Stockholmers B-NORP
? O
-RRB- O
are O
varying O
their O
commuting O
times O
. O

Some O
are O
taking O
different O
routes O
. O

Some O
are O
riding O
bicycles O
. O

And O
many O
are O
availing O
themselves O
of O
mass O
transit O
. O

As O
the O
WSJ B-ORG
explains O
: O
Before O
the O
trial O
began O
, O
Stockholm B-GPE
spent O
about B-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
180 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
on O
improvements O
to O
public O
transportation O
. O

It O
bought O
about O
200 B-CARDINAL
new O
buses O
and O
added O
rush O
- O
hour O
trains O
, O
express O
bus O
routes O
and O
more O
park O
- O
and O
- O
ride O
lots O
. O

But O
the O
changes O
had O
little O
impact O
on O
the O
number O
of O
people O
who O
left O
their O
private O
cars O
at O
home O
. O

In O
spring B-DATE
2006 I-DATE
, O
however O
, O
during O
the O
trial O
, O
use O
of O
all O
forms O
of O
public O
transportation O
jumped O
6 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
and O
ridership O
on O
inner O
- O
city O
bus O
routes O
rose O
9 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
compared O
with O
a O
year O
earlier O
. O

Now O
that O
the O
six B-DATE
- I-DATE
month I-DATE
trial O
has O
ended O
, O
the O
city O
has O
scheduled O
a O
referendum O
to O
let O
voters O
decide O
whether O
to O
make O
the O
congestion O
- O
pricing O
scheme O
permanent O
. O

A O
June B-DATE
poll O
found O
that O
52 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
voters O
favored O
the O
plan O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
congestion O
pricing O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
has O
n't O
gotten O
past O
the O
talking O
stage O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
-- O
a O
system O
that O
tracks O
every O
car O
's O
movements O
through O
transponders O
will O
go O
over O
with O
the O
public O
in O
Va B-GPE
. O

There O
remain O
people O
who O
wo O
n't O
buy O
smarttags O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
Big O
Brother O
to O
have O
the O

-LRB- O
or O
their O
spouse O
's O

. O
-RRB- O

It O
strikes O
me O
as O
remarkable O
that O
our O
transportation O
policies O
are O
more O
socialistic O
than O
Sweden B-GPE
's O
. O

We O
wo O
n't O
do O
photo O

, O
and O
you O
are O
suggesting O
this O
? O

Anonymous B-PERSON
, O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
the O
Swedish B-NORP
system O
requires O
people O
to O
install O
transponders O
. O

Some O
people O
will O
prefer O
that O
option O
because O
it O
's O
more O
convenient O
. O

EMR B-PERSON

By O
all O
accounts O
the O
Stockholm B-GPE
experiment O
has O
been O
a O
success O
, O
so O
far O
. O

Three B-CARDINAL
issues O
come O
to O
mind O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
Stockholm B-GPE
spent O
$ B-MONEY
180 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
on O
transportation O
improvements O
before O
the O
experiment O
. O

Would O
the O
experiment O
have O
been O
as O
successful O
if O
they O
had O
not O
spent O
the O
money O
? O

Was O
the O
`` O
success O
'' O
a O
manufactured O
result O
to O
cover O
up O
for O
the O
previously O
failed O
investment O
? O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
Stockholm B-GPE
had O
the O
presence O
of O
mind O
and O
the O
fairness O
of O
government O
to O
put O
this O
together O
as O
an O
experiment O
, O
and O
allow O
the O
citizens O
to O
dismantle O
it O
later O
if O
they O
thought O
it O
not O
worthwhile O
. O

That O
is O
an O
admirable O
approach O
, O

what O
US B-NORP
government O
has O
ever O
incorporated O
a O
policy O
as O
a O
test O
and O
THEN O
put O
it O
up O
for O
referendum O
? O

One O
of O
our O
problems O
is O
that O
having O
made O
a O
mistake O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
get O
the O
government O
to O
own O
up O
to O
it O
. O

Where O
is O
the O
referendum O
on O
whether O
we O
should O
spend O
umpteen B-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
on O
the O
Tyson B-LOC
's O
project O
? O

Focus O
groups O
and O
special O
interests O
do O
n't O
count O
. O

Third B-ORDINAL
, O
granted O
, O
the O
government O
in O
Stockholm B-GPE
has O
every O
incentive O
to O
spin O
this O
in O
a O
good O
light O
, O

and O
all O
the O
reviews O
seem O
good O
. O

I O
'm O
suspicious O
when O
no O
one O
seems O
to O
be O
able O
to O
find O
any O
shortcomings O
. O

In O
London B-GPE
, O
it O
took O
quite O
some O
time O
for O
the O
economic O
effects O
to O
sort O
themselves O
out O
and O
be O
measured O
. O

Although O
the O
London B-GPE
experiment O
also O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
success O
, O
there O
is O
considerable O
movement O
against O
it O
and O
the O
rapid O
rise O
in O
tolling O
charges O
that O
followed O
. O

It O
does O
not O
seem O
likely O
that O
it O
will O
be O
repeated O
in O
other O
English B-NORP
cities O
. O

For O
the O
record O
, O
I O
'm O
in O
favor O
of O
congestion O
tolling O
, O
but O
I O
also O
think O
it O
will O
hasten O
the O
de-emphasis O
of O
central O
areas O
. O

In O
London B-GPE
there O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
distinct O
decrease O
in O
business O
just O
inside O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
congestion O
zone O
and O
a O
distinct O
increase O
just O
outside O
. O

It O
is O
too O
soon O
to O
see O
what O
happens O
in O
Stockholm B-GPE
, O

but O
the O
situation O
in O
stockholm B-GPE
is O
a O
lot O
different O
from O
London B-GPE
. O

Singapore B-GPE
is O
another O
example O
of O
effective O
use O
of O
congestion O
pricing O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
usre O
that O
there O
's O
much O
about O
Singapore B-GPE
's O
governmental O
philosophy O
that O
we O
should O
emulate O
-LRB- O
thinly O
disguised O
one B-CARDINAL
- O
party O
rule O
-RRB- O
but O
, O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
spent O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
time O
there O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
20 I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
I O
can O
testify O
that O
traffic O
in O
the O
center O
city O
is O
much O
improved O
without O
any O
indication O
that O
economic O
development O
has O
been O
curtailed O
. O

In O
Southern B-LOC
California I-LOC
, O
there O
are O
at B-CARDINAL
least I-CARDINAL
two I-CARDINAL
tollways O
with O
variable O
pricing O
that O
fluctuates O
with O
traffic O
density O
. O

The O
highway O
design O
is O
configured O
to O
give O
drivers O
options O
about O
whether O
to O
pay O
the O
higher O
rates O
or O
get O
off O
the O
road O
. O

Seems O
to O
work O
. O

re O
: O
congestion O
pricing O
and O
`` O
edge O
'' O
impacts O
. O

simple O
- O
move O
the O
boundaries O
... O
:--RRB- O

further O
, O
let O
's O
think O
outside O
the O
box O
here O
. O

what O
makes O
`` O
congestion O
pricing O
'' O
- O
WORK O
? O

It O
's O
electronic O
tolling O
. O

`` O
congestion O
pricing O
'' O
is O
but O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
possible O
outcomes O
based O
on O
the O
underlying O
technology O
. O

The O
privacy O
aspects O
are O
undeniable O
but O
the O
momentum O
towards O
electronic O
tolling O
is O
also O
. O

Right O
now O
.. O
they O
can O
`` O
track O
'' O
you O
with O
your O
cell O
phone O
and O
your O
credit O
card O
as O
well O
as O
red O
- O
light O
cameras O
and O
even O
security O
cameras O
in O
businesses O
. O

Electronic O
Tolling O
will O
make O
possible O
other O
methods O
of O
collecting O
revenue O
from O
vehicular O
travel O
besides O
congestion O
pricing O
. O

Obviously O
new O
roads O
/ O
expanded O
/ O
improved O
roads O
will O
also O
be O
possible O
- O
roads O
that O
we O
currently O
have O
no O
money O
for O
and O
unlikely O
to O
have O
money O
for O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O

Electronic O
Tolls O
present O
an O
opportunity O
to O
build O
new O
roads O
shortly O
after O
the O
study O
/ O
decision O
is O
made O
- O
vice O
waiting O
for O
years B-DATE
.. O
and O
in O
VDOT B-ORG
's O
case O
decades B-DATE
. O

The O
primary O
difference O
between O
this O
country O
and O
other O
countries O
' O
use O
of O
electronic O
tolling O
is O
that O
we O
're O
still O
thinking O
of O
individual O
roads O
whereas O
those O
other O
countries O
are O
implementing O
electronic O
tolling O
for O
the O
REGION O
- O
as O
a O
way O
to O
SHAPE O
the O
entire O
network O
's O
congestion O
. O

So O
.. O
think O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
entire O
NoVa B-LOC
area O
with O
a O
connecting O
network O
of O
electronically O
tolled O
roads O
being O
priced O
by O
the O
hour B-TIME
... O
and O
the O
place O
much O
like O
cell O
phone O
minutes O
. O

You O
have O
to O
admit O
- O
the O
cell O
phone O
business O
model O
does O
two B-CARDINAL
things O
very O
, O
very O
well O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
you O
pay O
for O
when O
/ O
where O
and O
do O
n't O
get O
a O
free O
ride O

and O
second B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
cell O
companies O
collect O
enough O
in O
revenues O
to O
keep O
building O
more O
cell O
towers O
and O
expand O
coverage O
. O

think O
about O
the O
same O
model O
with O
roads O
and O
electronic O
tolling O
. O

Larry B-PERSON
, O
the O
cell O
phone O
analogy O
is O
brilliant O
. O

That O
is O
the O
logic O
of O
where O
the O
technology O
will O
take O
us O
-- O
if O
only O
politics O
do O
n't O
stand O
in O
the O
way O
. O

Either O
Nova B-PERSON
Scout I-PERSON
is O
right O
or O
Larry B-PERSON
is O
right O
. O

Congestion O
pricing O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
limited O
Singapore B-GPE
's O
economic O
activity O
, O
but O
how O
would O
you O
know O
? O

For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
it O
's O
like O
traffic O
congestion O
: O

the O
demand O
is O
so O
high O
that O
even O
if O
you O
build O
new O
roads O
or O
throttle O
the O
demand O
, O
it O
is O
still O
high O
. O

For O
another O
, O
If O
Larry B-PERSON
is O
right O
and O
congestion O
pricing O
has O
shaped O
the O
region O
, O
then O
some O
of O
that O
economic O
activity O
is O
not O
happening O
where O
it O
might O
have O
otherwise O
. O

Transportation O
is O
very O
closey O
connected O
with O
economic O
activity O
. O

So O
in O
that O
sense O
, O
what O
tolling O
does O
is O
impose O
a O
tax O
on O
profits O
that O
have O
not O
yet O
been O
made O
. O

I O
think O
you O
should O
tax O
only O
income O
and O
sales O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
you O
could O
rationalize O
this O
as O
a O
sales O
tax O
on O
use O
of O
the O
roads O
. O

I O
still O
think O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
institute O
tolling O
except O
in O
special O
circumstances O
: O
Expensive O
bridges O
, O
and O
highly O
congested O
zones O
, O
for O
example O
. O

Otherwise O
a O
gas O
tax O
set O
high O
enough O
to O
do O
its O
job O
is O
still O
a O
fairer O
and O
cheaper O
method O
, O
and O
more O
environmentally O
friendly O
: O

the O
infrastructure O
is O
in O
place O
, O
and O
it O
automatically O
taxes O
by O
distance O
, O
weight O
, O
and O
horsepower O
. O

The O
cell O
phone O
analogy O
is O
far O
from O
brilliant O
. O

There O
are O
multiple O
cell O
phone O
companies O
-LRB- O
Verizon B-ORG
Wireless I-ORG
, O
Cingular B-ORG
, O
Sprint B-ORG
, O
TMobile B-ORG
, O
etc. O
-RRB- O
. O

There O
is O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
medieval O
and O
corrupt O
General B-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
. O

And O
their O
goal O
was O
, O
is O
and O
will O
remain O
the O
transfer O
of O
wealth O
from O
the O
economically O
successful O
-LRB- O
and O
congetsed O
-RRB- O
areas O
to O
those O
areas O
of O
the O
state O
locked O
in O
the O
economic O
practices O
of O
the B-DATE
mid I-DATE
1800s I-DATE
. O

This O
will O
not O
end O
until O
the B-LAW
Dillon I-LAW
Rule I-LAW
is O
discarded O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
or O
Northern B-LOC
Virginia I-LOC
forms O
a O
separate O
state O
. O

Congestion O
`` O
pricing O
'' O
= O
congestion O
`` O
taxation O
'' O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
continue O
the O
cell O

analogy O
then O
Maryland B-GPE
ought O
to O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
propose O
their O

a O

to O
the B-ORG

The O

i.e. O
the O

today O

Until O
there O

this O

" O
Before O

: O
For O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
the O
main O

too O
rocky O

Moreover O
, O
the O

and O
- O
except O
for O

- O
other O

Therefore O
the O

In O

the O

Anyone O

In O
fact O
, O
Palau B-GPE

" O
Tourism O

the O

" O

Early O
Taiwanese B-NORP

have O
certainly O
been O
proved O
perspicacious O
, O
since O
Palau B-GPE

- O

is O
its O
greatest O

Diving O

have O
hailed O
Palau B-GPE
as O
the O
greatest O
of O
the O
seven B-CARDINAL
wonders O
of O

Its O

support O
more O

The O

so O
that O
even O

it O

there O
are O
two B-CARDINAL
viable O
directions O
to O
get O
into O

industry O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
is O
to O
invest O
in O
a O
tourism O
- O
related O
industry O
in O
Palau B-GPE
, O
the O
other O
is O
to O
increase O
the O
number O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
tourists O
and O
extend O
profit O
opportunities O
into O
Taiwan B-GPE
itself O
. O

Oddly O
, O
despite O
Palau B-GPE
's O
beauty O
, O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
tourism O
has O
dropped O
off O
considerably O
. O

In O
1997 B-DATE
, O
there O
were O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
70,000 I-CARDINAL
foreign O
visits O
to O
Palau B-GPE

Last B-DATE
year I-DATE
the O
figure O
was O
50,000 B-CARDINAL

Taiwan B-GPE
has O
been O
, O
along O
with O
Japan B-GPE
, O
one O
of O
the O
main O
sources O
of O
tourists O
to O
Palau B-GPE
. O

In O
1997 B-DATE
, O
the O
number O
of O
Taiwanese B-NORP
visitors O
peaked O
at O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
30,000 I-CARDINAL
annually O
, O
but O
now O
is O
down O
to O
well O
below O
20,000 B-CARDINAL

As O
a O
result O
, O
Taiwan B-GPE

says O
that O
a O
major O
reason O
why O

is O
that O
tour O

in O
Taiwan B-GPE
no O
longer O

push O
Palau B-GPE

a O

3000 B-MONEY
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
citing O
inadequate O

This O
made O

to O
other O

Guam B-GPE

" O
If O
the O
price O
is O
raised O
for O
tour O
groups O
, O
no O
one O
is O
interested O

but O
if O
the O
original O

, O
the O

the O

Most O
people O

go O

they O

Though O
Palau B-GPE

it O
lacks O
peripheral O
tourist O
facilities O
like O

so O
naturally O
the O

are O
less O

James B-PERSON

that O
the O

If O
the O

the O
catch O
is O
limited O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
tuna O
stocks O
there O
are O
high O
, O
so O
Palau B-GPE
is O
more O
suited O
to O
line O
fishing O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
Tai B-PERSON
Jung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
fei I-PERSON
is O
already O
running O
a O
tuna O
base O
there O
, O
and O
it O
is O
debatable O
whether O
there O
is O
the O
need O
for O
another O
one O
. O

Koo B-PERSON
warns O
: O
" O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
estimate O
the O
potential O
catch O
. O

If O
there O
were O
several O
firms O
, O
the O
risk O
would O
be O
much O
greater O
. O
" O

In O
addition O
, O
though O
there O
are O
many O
varieties O
of O
fish O
around O
Palau B-GPE
, O
the O
scale O
of O
operations O
is O
small O
, O
and O
markets O
are O
far O
away O
, O
so O
the O
return O
on O
investment O
would O
not O
necessarily O
be O
very O
high O
. O

Koo B-PERSON
points O
instead O
to O
a O
different O
option O
: O
The O
waters O
around O
Palau B-GPE
are O
clear O
and O
warm O
, O
which O
makes O
them O
suited O
to O
aquaculture O
. O

So O
far O
, O
returns O
from O
the O
small O
- O
scale O
aquaculture O
of O
scallops O
have O
been O
decent O
. O

Koo B-PERSON
cautions O
, O
however O
, O
that O
" O
if O
you O
want O
to O
invest O
, O
you O
have O
to O
go O
large O
- O
scale O
, O
because O
after O
all O
Palau B-GPE
is O
far O
from O
the O
main O
markets O

Palau B-GPE

In O
1986 B-DATE
, O
Palau B-GPE
, O
like O
many O
former O
American B-NORP
- O
controlled O
trust O
territories O
, O
signed O
a B-LAW
" I-LAW
Compact I-LAW
of I-LAW
Free I-LAW
Association I-LAW
" O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

The O
agreement O
allows O
Palauan B-NORP
products O
to O
enter O
the O
States B-GPE
tax O
- O
free O
, O
and O
there O
are O
no O
quota O
limits O
for O
such O
things O
as O
textiles O
. O

For O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
a O
major O
producer O
of O
textiles O
and O
electronics O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
strong O
investment O
incentive O
. O

Currently O
Japanese B-NORP
and O
Taiwanese B-NORP
business O
people O
are O
negotiating O
with O
the O
Palauan B-NORP
government O
to O
establish O
a B-GPE
Palau I-GPE
Free I-GPE
Trade I-GPE
Zone I-GPE
. O

The O
idea O
is O
for O
Palau B-GPE
to O
designate O
a O
special O
zone O
for O
economic O
development O
, O
with O
the O
Palau B-GPE
government O
providing O
tax O
and O
land O
- O
use O
incentives O
. O

The O
zone O
would O
be O
for O
processing O
of O
exports O
, O
mainly O
in O
textiles O
and O
electronics O
, O
and O
mainly O
to O

, O
which O

handling O
the O
Hung B-PERSON
Kuo I-PERSON
project O
, O
is O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
business O
climate O
in O
Palau B-GPE
. O

He O
says O
that O
right O
now O
the O
main O
obstacles O
to O
foreign O
investment O
are O
land O
acquisition O
and O
communications O
. O

Under O
Palauan B-NORP
law O
foreigners O
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
own O
land O
there O
, O
but O
can O
only O
lease O
land O
for O
development O
. O

The O
longest O
permitted O
lease O
is O
50 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

But O
even O
leasing O
is O
a O
complicated O
matter O
, O
because O
traditionally O
land O
in O
Palau B-GPE
is O
owned O
jointly O
by O
the O
family O
and O
the O
clan O
. O

Moreover O
, O
communications O
and O
Internet O
access O
are O
not O
very O
reliable O
. O

All O
of O
these O
problems O
deter O
investors O
. O

Though O
the O
communications O
problems O
may O
be O
resolved O
within O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
- O
the O

plan O
to O
" O
be O
prudent O
. O
" O

" O
The O
point O
to O
watch O
out O
for O
in O
the O
whole O
plan O
is O
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
firms O
may O
not O
understand O
that O
it O
might O
not O
be O
all O
that O
good O
a O
deal O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
the O
Palau B-GPE
authorities O
, O
" O
he O
says O
. O

Currently O
foreign O
firms O
are O
more O
pro-active O
than O
the O
Palauan B-NORP
government O
, O
which O
has O
its O
own O
concerns O
: O
The O
indigenous O
population O
is O
small O
, O
and O
there O
could O
be O
social O
problems O
if O
a O
large O
number O
of O
foreign O
workers O
come O
to O
the O
islands O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
government O
must O
weigh O
economic O
development O
against O
environmental O
destruction O
. O

" O
The O
terms O
under O
which O
Palau B-GPE
would O
accept O
the O
proposed O
zone O
may O
not O
be O
as O
good O
as O
many O
Taiwan B-GPE
business O
people O
optimistically O
expect O
. O
" O

Looking O
at O
the O
larger O
picture O
, O
however O
, O
there O
are O
many O
areas O
and O
ways O
to O
invest O
. O

A O
careful O
look O
will O
show O
that O
Palau B-GPE
has O
many O
pearls O

Li B-PERSON
Mao I-PERSON

tsung I-PERSON
, O
a O
pottery O
expert O
living O
in O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
who O
was O
commissioned O
by O
the O
ROC B-GPE
government O
to O
do O
a O
study O
of O
the O
suitability O
of O
Palauan B-NORP
clays O
for O
pottery O
, O
says O
that O
Palau B-GPE
has O
a O
lot O
of O
clay O
of O
decent O
quality O
, O
making O
the O
islands O
a O
good O
location O
for O
the O
development O
of O
art O
pottery O
or O
large O
scale O
pottery O
and O

production O
. O

Unique O
investment O
opportunities O
like O
these O
are O
waiting O
to O
be O
taken O
up O
by O
alert O
entrepreneurs O
. O

Perhaps O
Palau B-GPE
is O
, O
as O
Gennie B-PERSON
Yen I-PERSON
says O
, O
like O
a O
just O
- O
opened O
oyster O
, O
with O
the O
pearl O
gleaming O
before O
your O
eyes O
. O

But O
to O
grasp O
the O
pearl O
, O
Taiwan B-GPE
business O
people O
will O
have O
to O
rely O
on O
their O
wisdom O
and O
experience O
. O


So O
, O
just O
now O
these O
two O
, O
eh O
, O
were O
analyzing O
these O
, O
ah O
, O
four B-QUANTITY
Kidd B-PERSON
class O
warships O
from O
different O
angles O
, O
some O
intrinsic O
problems O
that O
exist O
with O
them O
and O
the O
effectiveness O
they O
are O
able O
to O
achieve O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
military O
capabilities O
. O

So O
, O
at O
this O
current O
level O
, O
for O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
military O
, O
can O
they O
improve O
the O
current O
military O
strength O
of O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
military O
. O

I O
should O
say O
that O
, O
eh O
, O
these O
four B-QUANTITY
warships O
entering O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
navy O
will O
certainly O
enhance O
somewhat O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
military O
strength O
on O
the O
ocean O
. O

Yeah O
. O

But O
I O
should O
say O
this O
improvement O
is O
still O
quite O
a O
long O
way O
from O
the O
goals O
that O
Taiwanese B-NORP
authorities O
and O
Taiwanese B-NORP
military O
want O
to O
achieve O
. O

So O
, O
taking O
a O
broader O
perspective O
, O
eh O
, O
it O
's O
like O
, O
er O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
for O
the O
Taiwanese B-NORP
navy O
, O
it O
's O
slapping O
a O
coat O
of O
gold O
paint O
on O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
the O
surface O
of O
a O
house O
of O
straw O
, O
eh O
, O
to O
make O
it O
look O
, O
eh O
, O
better O
, O
more O
splendid O
. O

But O
a O
house O
of O
straw O
is O
a O
house O
of O
straw O
after O
all O
: O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
stand O
up O
when O
the O
big O
bad O
wolf O
comes O
. O

I O
think O
the O
political O
significance O
is O
greater O
than O
the O
military O
significance O
. O

They O
seem O
to O
feel O
that O
after O
buying O
these O
four O
, O
four O
warships O
, O
eh O
, O
they O
psychologically O
feel O
, O
feel O
that O
they O
've O
become O
a O
little O
closer O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
. O

Psychologically O
they O
feel O
that O
once O
they O
've O
got O
these O
four B-QUANTITY
, O
then O
it O
's O
as O
Chief O
Editor O
Chen B-PERSON
said O
just O
now O
: O
I O
slap O
on O
a O
coat O
of O
gold O
paint O
, O
then O
at O
least O
when O
the O
wolf O
comes O
, O
this O
first O
layer O
should O
be O
able O
to O
act O
, O
to O
a O
limited O
extent O
, O
to O
act O
as O
a O
little O
protection O
. O

They O
even O
fantasize O
to O
themselves O
that O
, O
eh O
, O
this O
gold O
paint O
might O
actually O
be O
armor O
, O
it O
's O
this O
kind O
of O
political O
implication O

travel O
if O
we O
went O
when O
he O
was O
ten B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
than O
-- O
yep O
, O
yep O
, O
yep O
. O
-- O
you O
know O
after O
that O
. O

when O
they O
're O
new O
infants O
it O
's O
like O
bring O
along O
a O
blanket O
so O
you O
can O
nurse O
them O
. O

And O
like O
you O
could O
do O
anything O
. O

You O
could O
probably O
go O
like O
do O
skydiving O
or O
something O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
. O

And O
if O
you O
were O
nursing O
the O
baby O
while O
you O
were O
skydiving O
the O
baby O
would O
be O
like O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

Alright O
. O

As O
long O
as O
we O
're O
nursing O
while O
we O
're O
doing O
this O
that O
's O
okay O
. O

That O
's O
what O
I O
thought O
too O
. O

And O
they O
do O
n't O
need O
that O
many O
clothes O
when O
they O
're O
that O
young O
. O

And O
they O
do O
n't O
need O
toys O
. O

So O
. O

You O
know O
basically O
you O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
bring O
anything O
. O
But O
%uh O
but O
you O
know O
your O
two B-CARDINAL
boobs O
. O

and O
%uh O
And O
since O
I O
ca O
n't O
really O
go O
anywhere O
without O
those O
anyhow O

They O
're O
hard O
to O
forget O

yeah O
. O

Hard O
to O
leave O
behind O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
I O
mean O
in O
then O
you O
know O
then O
we O
can O
just O
use O
disposables O
if O
we O
're O
travelling O
, O

so O

oh O
definitely O
. O

Do O
n't O

we O
did O

one B-CARDINAL
time O
we O
were O
like O
we O
were O
travelling O
in O
the O
car O

we O
were O
like O
oh O
we O
can O
just O
bring O
a O
little O
mini O
diaper O
pail O
and O
all O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
was O
after O
one B-CARDINAL
time O

I O
went O
never O
again O
. O

Disposables O
for O
travelling O
. O

And O
did O
you O
%um O
Absolutely O
. O
Every O
now O
did O
you O
supplement O
nursing O
with O
bottles O
at O
all O
or O
did O
n't O
, O
did O
n't O
you O
? O

No O
. O

No O
. O

Somehow O
like O
I O
read O
too O
many O
of O
the O
books O

so O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
like O
no O
formula O
. O

It O
does O
make O
a O
difference O

like O
I O
always O
thought O
formula O
smells O
kind O
of O
disgusting O

oh O
yeah O
. O

Like O
when O
they O
throw O
up O
it O
smells O
disgusting O

and O
when O
they O
make O
their O
little O
doo O
- O
doo's O
it O
smells O
grosser O
if O
they O
're O
on O
formula O
. O

But O
if O
they O
're O
totally O
breast O
milk O
now O
you O
'll O
find O
this O
hard O
this O
believe O
but O
if O
they O
're O
totally O
breast O
milk O
for O
like O
the O
first O
couple O
months O
-- O
mhm O
. O
they O
do O
n't O
their O
number O
twos O
do O
n't O
smell O
at O
all O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
smell O
like O
anything O
. O

It O
's O
like O
it O
looks O
like O
shit O
but O
it O
does O
n't O
smell O
like O
anything O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

And O
did O
you O
pump O
or O
not O
? O

yeah O
I O
pumped O
. O

What O
joy O
that O
was O
. O

Did O
you O
use O
a O
manual O
or O
a O
%uh O
did O
you O
get O
one O
of O
those O
little O
battery O
ones O
? O

Batter- O
Battery O
operated O
deal O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
so O
too O
. O

Now O
like O
I O
can O
tell O
you O

I O
can O
find O
the O
exact O
brand O
name O
of O
it O
if O
you O
want O
some O
time O
. O

But O
like O
it O
had O
like O
this O
little O
like O
nozzle O
attachment O
thing O
on O
it O
which O
was O
what O
it O
said O
you O
were O
supposed O
to O
use O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
I O
used O
it O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
for O
like O
three B-TIME
seconds I-TIME

I O
was O
like O
-- O
-- O
%ah O
get O
this O
thing O
off O
me O
. O

That O
really O
hurt O
. O

Do O
n't O
ever O
do O
that O
again O
. O

And O
I O
forget O
what O
it O
said O
it O
was O
for O

I O
think O
it O
said O
it O
was O
for O
if O
you O
had O
small O
breasts O
or O
something O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O

oh O
okay O
. O

so O
like O
I O
took O
that O
thing O

and O
I O
threw O
it O
away O
. O

It O
was O
like O
a O
little O
part O
you O
put O
on O
top O
of O
a O
nozzle O
thing O
. O

It O
was O
just O
like O
an O
extra O
attachment O

and O
I O
took O
that O

and O
I O
-- O
mhm O
okay O
. O
-- O
threw O
it O
away O

okay O
. O

And O
then O
it O
was O
fine O
. O

okay O
. O

So O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
seemed O
to O
work O
fine O

ye- O

You O
know O
i- O
if O
I O
, O
if O
you O
could O
avoid O
it O
you O
know O
if O
y- O
if O
it O
was O
a O
choice O
in O
your O
life O
to O
say O
well O
for O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
couple O
months O
I O
'll O
just O
be O
home O

and O
I O
'll O
just O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
rest O

and O
I O
'll O
take O
it O
easy O

and O
if O
I O
'm O
not O
-- O
-- O
sleeping O
at O
night O
I O
'll O
just O
sleep O
during O
the O
day O
or O
sleep O
when O
the O
baby O
sleeps O
. O

yeah O
. O

Not O
do O
this O
whole O
pumping O
thing O

I O
mean O
if O
I O
had O
to O
do O
it O
all O
over O
that O
's O
what O
I O
would O
do O
. O

oh O
yeah O

because O
I O
was O
thinking O
it O
would O
be O
easier O
because O
then O
other O
people O
could O
feed O
the O
baby O
and O
you O
would O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
so O
tied O
to O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
if O
you O
want O
to O
go O
out O
to O
a O
movie O
or O
something O
. O

Mean O
that O
you O
know O
did O
you O

Well O
we O
never O
go O
out O
. O

I O
mean O
you O
know O
what O
Norm B-PERSON
and O
I O
are O
like O

I O
mean O
. O

Well O
believe O
me O

when O
you O
have O
a O
baby O
you O
'll O
want O
, O
you O
'll O
to O
put O
it O
in O
someone O
else O
's O
house O
or O
someone O
come O
watch O
it O
in O
your O
house O
and O
go O
anywhere O
else O
. O

See O
that O
's O
what O
I O
was O
thinking O
like O
for O
my O
in O
laws O
and O
stuff O
when O
we O
go O
home O
for O
Christmas B-DATE
. O

mhm O
. O

It O
would O
be O
so O
nice O
to O
just O
you O
know O
leave O
the O
baby O
with O
them O

but O
you O
ca O
n't O
leave O
the O
baby O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
if O
you O
, O
you O
know O
y- O
you O
might O
have O
to O
try O
one B-CARDINAL
or O
two B-CARDINAL
before O
you O
find O
one B-CARDINAL
that O
works O

but O
yeah O
. O
once O

and O
you O
know O
they O
have O
like O
things O
and O
like O
can O
set O
the O
tension O
or O
whatever O

they O
get O
suck O
suck O
power O
. O

the O
tension O

they O
're O
like O
the O
little O
knob O
on O
your O
sewing O
machine O
. O

You O
can O
set O
the O
, O
the O
power O
level O
and O
stuff O

and O
and O
it O
g- O

Or O
like O
extra O
suck O
for O
just O
starting O
to O
suck O
. O

You O
know O
e- O
it O
's O
like O
you O
once O
you O
get O
used O
it O
i- O

you O
know O
at O
first O
you O
feel O
like O
what O
am O
I O
doing O
putting O
this O
machine O
on O
me O

it O
's O
disgusting O
or O
obscene O
or O
something O
. O

But O
once O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
it O
was O
%uh O
you O
know O
you O
can O
like O
read O
while O
you O
're O
doing O
it O
. O

It O
was O
like O
boring O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

okay O
. O

And O
what O
does O
it O
go O
into O

like O
a O
little O
plastic O
bag O
**thingy** O
? O

%uh O
well O
the O
thing O
I O
had O
was O
like O
-- O
-- O
like O
you O
screwed O
on O
this O
whole O
motor O
suction O
part O
-- O
uh-huh O
. O
-- O
on O
to O
something O
that O
was O
just O
like O
a O
, O
a O
jar O
bottom O
. O

You O
know O
just O
looked O
like O
a O
screw O
thing O
so O
that O
it O
went O
to O
this O
plastic O
container O
. O

okay O
. O

And O
you O
can O
reuse O
the O
plastic O
container O
? O

And O
then O
what O
I O
would O
do O
is O
just O
%uh O
I O
would O
bring O
little O
bags O
like O
that O
you O
're O
supposed O
to O
put O
formula O
in O
with O
me O
to O
work O
. O

oh O
okay O
. O

And O
then O
I O
'd O
pour O
it O
from O
the O
container O
into O
the O
plastic O
bag O
and O
seal O
it O
up O
and O
then O
go O
you O
know O
rinse O
out O
the O
container O
thing O
and O
wash O
it O
the O
next O
day O
. O

And O
did O
you O
throw O
away O
the O
plastic O
bags O
when O
you O
were O
done O
? O

Well O
see O
then O
the O
plastic O
bag O
is O
designed O
to O
go O
inside O
a O
bottle O
thing O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
th- O
%eh O
so O
then O
you O
so O
you O
throw O
the O
plastic O
bag O
away O
when O
you O
're O
done O
. O

After O
your O
baby O
drinks O
the O
milk O
yeah O
. O

yeah O

okay O

okay O
. O

I O
'm O
just O
trying O
to O
you O
know O

we O
have O
a O
f- O
%um O
%uh O
%uh O

And O
that O
way O
you O
can O
freeze O
them O

so O
you O
know O
we O
'd O
end O
up O

yeah O
. O

there O
was O
sort O
of O
like O
a O
, O
a O
go O
or O
no O
go O
for O
breast O
pumping O

like O
once O
you O
just O
kind O
of O
got O
everything O
going O
it O
was O
like O
it O
ended O
up O
I O
was O
pumping O
too O
much O
you O
know O

it O
was O
like O
%mm O
okay O
. O
we O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
freezer O
full O

like O
we O
found O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
later I-DATE
a O
freezer O
full O
of O
breast O
milk O
. O

God O
. O

oh O
let O
's O
just O
throw O
this O
all O
away O
. O

It O
's O
like O
all O
that O
hard O
work O

but O
it O
was O
either O
you O
know O
it O
was O
either O
explode O
or O
you O
know O
pretty O
much O

But O
I O
thought O
like O
you O
totally O
got O
down O
to O
the O
level O
so O
even O
if O
you O
only O
breast O
fed O
one B-CARDINAL
, O
you O
know O
once O
a O
day O
that O
that O
's O
how O
much O
milk O
you O
would O
have O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

All O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
is O
to O
get O
a O
big O
bag O
. O

okay O

It O
's O
like O
once O
I O
started O
at O
at O
work O
I O
you O
know O

once O
you O
, O
once O
he O
was O
getting O
bigger O
or O
something O
there O
was O

like O
I O
was O
making O
two B-CARDINAL
bags O

and O
it O
was O
like O
if O
you O
sat O
down O
you O
either O
did O
two B-CARDINAL
bags O
or O
you O
'd O
explode O

that O
was O
it O
. O

And O
she O
just O
could O
n't O
quite O
drink O
that O
much O

so O

%mm O
okay O
. O

You O
know O
that O
was O
why O
I O
was O
working O
in O
the O
morning O

the O
morning O
's O
when O
you O
do O
the O
most O
. O

Everybody O
's O
different O

so O
it O
probably O

yeah O

yeah O

that O
's O
true O
. O

Well O
I O
only O
have O
fourteen B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
left O

so O
. O

Wow O

're O
getting O
there O

with O
the O

anxiety O
. O

I O
know O

oh O
no O
. O

I O
had O
the O
miscarriage O
anxiety O
up O
until O
the O

you O
know O
because O
you O
have O
all O
those O
well O
wishers O
you O
know O
telling O
you O
about O
all O
those O
things O
you O
know O
. O

ooh O
everybody O
wants O
to O
start O
telling O
you O
these O
things O

like O
people O
would O
like O
corner O
me O
to O

. O

It O
's O
like O
somehow O
some O
O O
B O
gyn O

I O
had O
so O
I O
talked O
to O
my O
doctor O
about O
it O

and O
apparently O
it O
's O
very O
rare O

so O
do O
n't O
ask O
me O
why O
I O
've O
heard O
so O
many O
stories O
about O
it O

but O

oh O
yeah O

and O
then O
there O
was O
this O
friend O
I O
had O

she O
was O
eight B-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
pregnant O

and O
you O
know O
baby O
had O
a O
cord O
accident O

and O
she O
died O
. O

Like O
most O
people O
they O
just O
have O
babies O

it O
all O
works O
out O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
. O

I O
know O

so O
I O
'm O
not O
so O
freaked O
out O
anymore O
. O

Good O
. O

That O
was O
like O

I O
was O
talking O
to O
Erica B-PERSON
on O
the O
phone O

and O
%uh O
that O
's O
what O
she O
told O
me O

she O
's O
like O
but O
d- O

to O
say O
that O
it O
was O
okay O
she O
was O
like O
saying O
that O
well O

but O
this O
woman O
is O
pregnant O
again O
and O
you O
know O
will O
have O
her O
baby O
again O
soon O

so O
it O
was O
like O
no O
big O
deal O
. O

No O

yeah O
. O

But O
having O
never O
been O
pregnant O
before O
, O
you O
know O
I O
'm O
sure O
Erica B-PERSON
has O
like O
no O
idea O

this O
woman O
must O
be O
on O
just O
you O
know O
absolute O
. O
pins O
and O
needles O
. O

She O
must O
be O
having O
the O
most O
miserable O
pregnancy O
in O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

yeah O

that O
's O
such O
a O
public O
thing O
. O

Like O
everyone O
knew O
she O
was O
pregnant O
. O

I O
mean O
once O
you O
're O
eight B-DATE
and I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
man O
, O
I O
mean O
there O
was O
nothing O
nice O
about O
it O

I O
know O
. O

you O
know O
if O
you O
've O
made O
it O
through O
the B-DATE
eight I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
man O
, O
you O
deserve O
it O
a O
baby O
. O

I O
bet O

I O
know O

and O
then O
you O
know O
and O
then O
to O
have O
to O
go O
back O
to O
work O
and O
you O
know O

and O
then O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
pregnancy O
must O
be O
just O
like O
fraught O
with O
anxiety O
and O
especially O
since O
it O
happened O
at O
eight B-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
months I-DATE
, O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O

and O
everybody O
is O
probably O
saying O
now O

instead O
of O
demagoguing O
the O

Here O
in O
Virginia B-GPE
, O
the B-ORG
General I-ORG
Assembly I-ORG
has O
been O
examining O
what O
Virginia B-GPE
can O
do O
to O
increase O
energy O
production O
. O

That O
is O
OK O
, O
as O
far O
as O
it O
goes O
. O

But O
there O
is O
nothing O
that O
Virginia B-GPE
can O
do O
to O
increase O
the O
global O
supply O
of O
oil O
, O
and O
probably O
little O
it O
can O
do O
to O
increase O
the O
petroleum O
refining O
capacity O
needed O
to O
convert O
oil O
to O
gasoline O
. O

What O
the O
political O
and O
business O
leadership O
of O
Virginia B-GPE
has O
so O
far O
failed O
utterly O
to O
do O
is O
admit O
that O
Virginia B-GPE
is O
acutely O
vulnerable O
to O
oil O
price O
shocks O
. O

Virginians B-NORP
consume O
more O
gasoline O
per O
capita O
than O
the O
national O
average O
, O
in O
part O
because O
our O
transportation O
policy O
is O
geared O
toward O
matching O
every O
increase O
in O
automobile O
travel O
with O
an O
increase O
in O
transportation O
capacity O
with O
no O
thought O
of O
modulating O
travel O
demand O
. O

But O
reality O
is O
a O
stubborn O
thing O
. O

With O
each O
increase O
in O
the O
price O
of O
gasoline O
, O
the O
bankruptcy O
of O
the O
old O
order O
becomes O
increasingly O
evident O
. O

Let O
us O
hope O
that O
Gov. O
Kaine B-PERSON
, O
who O
prides O
himself O
on O
straight O
talk O
, O
begins O
leveling O

the O

Jim B-PERSON
- O
You O
are O
right O
on O
the O

about O
how O

so O
why O
not O
try O
to O
make O

really O
work O
for O
Virginia B-GPE

The O
future O
in O

to O
the O
nation O

company O
or O
person O
who O
develops O
the O
alternative O
to O

. O

Why O
not O
do O
everything O
we O
can O
to O
assure O
that O
future O
arises O
from O
Virginia O
? O

Rather O
than O
drilling O

we O
should O
be O

then O

If O
the O
GA B-ORG

the O

then O
the O

pick O

Or O
, O
the O
GA B-ORG
could O
actually O
cut O
the O

and O
you O
would O
keep O
some O
more O

Check O

The O
only O
answer O
to O

believe O
that O

Does O

If O

Zone O

is O
the O

make O
sure O
that O

the O

Why O

Counties O
and O
even O
at O
different O

the O

? O

Zone O

is O
trying O
to O
do O
much O
more O
than O
reflect O
different O
tax O
rates O
. O

Take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
following O

http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx O

Assuming O
the O
general O
accuracy O
of O
the O

, O

differences O
in O
do O
not O
explain O

Look O
at O
Arizona B-GPE

for O
example O
. O

There O
are O
much O
higher O

in O

around O
the B-LOC
Grand I-LOC

much O
more O

in O
the O

Yet O
, O
Phoenix B-GPE

tend O
to O
be O
signficantly O
higher O

Ditto O
for O

From O
what O
I O
quickly O
found O

both O

have O

either O

There O

5000 B-CARDINAL
AIDS O

stating O
unequivocally O
that O

contemptuously O
dismissed O
as O
fit O
only O
for O

by O

then O
in O
a O

his O

President O

addressed O
Parliament B-ORG
on O
the O
matter O

The O
program O
of O
the O

in O
this O

is O
based O
on O
the O
thesis O
that O
HIV O

But O
Embeke B-PERSON
did O
n't O
stop O
there O
. O

AIDS O
is O
Acquired O

It O
's O
a O
sensible O
thing O
to O
ask O
- O
Does O
one B-CARDINAL
virus O
cause O
a O
syndrome O
? O

A O
virus O
can O
not O
cause O
a O
syndrome O
, O
and O
AIDS O
is O
a O
syndrome O
. O

It O
might O
be O
a O
case O
of O
pure O
semantics O
but O
the O
President O
has O
resolutely O
refused O
to O
say O
clearly O
that O
HIV O
causes O
AIDS O
. O

He O
has O
accused O
his O
critics O
of O
racism O
when O
they O
point O
to O
unsafe O
sexual O
practices O
and O
the O
high O
incidents O
of O

in O
South B-GPE

to O
explain O
why O
an O

This O

two B-CARDINAL
and O
a O
covered O
space O
would O
probably O
be O
much O
less O
than O
equivalent O
office O
space O
. O

If O
we O
stimulated O
home O
- O
grown O
markets O
, O
we O
might O
not O
send O
so O
much O
to O
China B-GPE
, O
although O
I O
suppose O
anything O
we O
can O
do O
to O
curb O
the O
trade O
deficit O
might O
be O
considered O
a O
good O
thing O
in O
some O
quarters O
. O

That O
's O
right O
. O

I O
know O
a O
guy O
who O
gets O
surplus O
building O
materials O
sorts O
and O
resells O
it O
. O

I O
've O
bought O
quite O
a O
bit O
from O
him O

and O
he O
apparently O
does O
a O
good O
business O
. O

The O
business O
itself O
is O
somewhat O
trashy O
looking O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
it O
is O
located O
on O
part O
of O
an O
old O
family O
farm O
, O

and O
the O
nearby O
houses O
are O
ones O
that O
have O
been O
spun O
off O
to O
family O
memebers O
. O

But O
if O
anybody O
else O
tried O
to O
duplicate O
it O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
think O
of O
anyplace O
in O
my O
county O
where O
it O
would O
be O
allowed O
, O
or O
else O
the O
requirements O
would O
be O
so O
onerous O
it O
could O
n't O
survive O
. O

In O
my O
home O
town O
, O
they O
once O
built O
an O
entire O
tanker O
truck O
for O
the O
fire O
department O
, O
out O
of O
stuff O
that O
came O
from O
the O
dump O
. O

We O
had O
really O
low O
taxes O
. O

The O
dump O
had O
well O
organized O
recycling O
areas O
located O
around O
the O
central O
landfill O
pit O
, O

and O
people O
had O
a O
good O
eye O
for O
things O
that O
others O
might O
want O
. O

Recycling O
is O
a O
really O
good O
idea O
, O

but O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
make O
it O
pay O
, O

and O
it O
has O
a O
waste O
stream O
of O
its O
own O
. O

What O
we O
need O
to O
do O
is O
to O
move O
the O
recycling O
process O
forward O
into O
the O
repair O
world O
. O

The O
Volkswagen B-ORG
Beetle B-PRODUCT
was O
a O
terrible O
car O
, O

but O
it O
was O
eminently O
recyclable O
. O

I O
had O
one B-CARDINAL
for O
almost B-DATE
twenty I-DATE
years I-DATE

and O
at O
the O
end O
there O
was O
n't O
a O
single O
part O
that O
was O
original O
. O

The O
entire O
body O
had O
been O
swapped O
out O
, O
the O
machinery O
several O
times O
, O
and O
the O
running O
gear O
many O
times O
. O

It O
was O
still O
running O
when O
I O
sold O
it O
, O

but O
if O
VDOT B-ORG
ever O
checked O
the O
serial O
numbers O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
would O
happen O
. O

The O
other O
thing O
we O
need O
to O
do O
is O
expand O
the O
deposit O
idea O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
having O
deposits O
on O
soft O
drink O
bottles O
, O
we O
should O
have O
them O
on O
appliances O
, O
autos O
and O
other O
big O
ticket O
items O
where O
they O
can O
do O
some O
good O
. O

The O
deposit O
would O
flow O
to O
the O
recycler O
who O
is O
the O
final O
user O
: O

this O
would O
make O
recycling O
profitable O
. O

He O
would O
claim O
the O
refund O
from O
the O
manufacturer O
. O

This O
would O
ensure O
that O
the O
user O
of O
a O
product O
pays O
for O
its O
disposal O
, O

and O
manufacturers O
would O
have O
an O
incentive O
to O
keep O
the O
deposit O
money O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
by O
building O
items O
that O
can O
be O
repaired O
rather O
than O
disposed O
of O
. O

In O
the O
case O
of O
foreign O
manufacturers O
, O
the O
recycling O
fee O
would O
haqve O
a O
similar O
effect O
as O
an O
import O
duty O
and O
could O
be O
collected O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
but O
without O
being O
called O
a O
tariff O
. O

Why O
do O
some O
localities O
charge O
for O
the O
service O
while O
others O
do O
n't O
? O

Just O
curious O
. O

Because O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
it O
is O
a O
money O
losing O
operation O
, O
or O
at O
most O
marginal O
. O

Recall O
the O
story O
of O
mandatory O
newspaper O
recycling O
in O
the O
District B-GPE
. O

As O
a O
political O
city O
, O
they O
created O
so O
much O
waste O
product O
they O
flooded O
the O
market O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
look O
down O
the O
road O
, O
think O
about O
what O
is O
going O
to O
happen O
after O
we O
spend O
a B-CARDINAL
few I-CARDINAL
billion I-CARDINAL
to O
meet O
the O
Chesapeake B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
waste O
water O
restrictions O
. O

Where O
are O
we O
going O
to O
put O
all O
the O
sludge O
that O
results O
? O

Once O
we O
stop O
putting O
it O
in O
the O
Bay B-LOC
, O
we O
are O
going O
to O
have O
to O
put O
it O
on O
the O
land O
. O

Then O
we O
will O
have O
regulations O
to O
prevent O
sludge O
runoff O
in O
order O
that O
we O
do O
n't O
pay O
for O
the O
same O
sludge O
creation O
multiple O
times O
. O

Eventually O
we O
will O
outlaw O
gravity O
so O
that O
sludge O
is O
prohibited O
from O
running O
downhill O
. O

Coming O
soon O
to O
a O
farm O
near O
you O
: O
two B-DATE
month I-DATE
's I-DATE
worth O
of O
stench O
. O

As O
an O
engineer O
and O
a O
flinty O
New B-NORP
Englander I-NORP
, O
and O
a O
farmer O
, O
I O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
fixing O
old O
junk O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
stand O
throwing O
something O
away O
. O

Maybe O
some O
of O
it O
comes O
from O
growing O
up O
on O
an O
island O
where O
there O
was O
no O
place O
to O
throw O
it O
. O

My O
father O
used O
to O
say O
that O
garbage O
was O
like O
scotch O
tape O
. O

-LRB- O
Shaking O
his O
thumb O
with O
an O
imaginary O
loop O
of O
tape O
on O
it O

-RRB- O

`` O
You O
ca O
n't O
throw O
it O
away O
, O

you O
can O
only O
stick O
it O
someplace O
else O
. O
'' O

When O
I O
'm O
repairing O
something O
that O
was O
designed O
so O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
fixed O
, O
it O
makes O
me O
crazy O
. O

I O
want O
to O
go O
find O
some O
enginner O
and O
marketing O
guy O
an O
knock O
heads O
together O
. O

Here O
are O
a O
few O
examples O
. O

A O
rototiller O
with O
gears O
made O
out O
of O
free O
machining O
brass O
. O

Guaranteed O
to O
fail O
. O

A O
windshiel O
wiper O
motor O
installed O
in O
a O
totally O
inaccessible O
place O
under O
the O
dash O
. O

It O
was O
installed O
by O
compressing O
four B-CARDINAL
little O
rubber O
studs O
into O
holes O
in O
the O
sheet O
metal O
, O
and O
sealed O
with O
a O
ten B-QUANTITY
inch I-QUANTITY
oblong O
flat O

When O
the O
rubber O
studs O
rotted O
away O
, O
the O
motor O
fell O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
torrent O
of O
rain O
that O
shorted O
out O
everything O
under O
the O
dash O
. O

A O
1/4 B-QUANTITY
inch I-QUANTITY
diameter O
spring O
loaded O
shift O
lever O
detent O
that O
you O
had O
to O
break O
the O
tractor O
in O
half O
to O
replace O
. O

Every O
piece O
of O
household O
plumbing O
and O
wiring O
I O
ever O
had O
to O
fish O
through O
a O
hollow O
wall O
. O

Anything O
that O
can O
only O
be O
repaired O
upside O
down O
. O

A O
twelve B-CARDINAL
bolt O
circle O
on O
a O
transmission O
housing O
with O
six B-CARDINAL
hex O
head O
bolts O
and O
six B-CARDINAL
star O

bolts O
. O

Try O
and O
figure O
that O
out O
in O
the O
dark O
under O
the O
car O
. O

The O
ignitor O
for O
the O
gas O
range O
that O
costs O
25 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
what O
the O
range O
cost O
. O

What O
's O
worse O
is O
, O
that O
because O
I O
'm O
good O
at O
this O
, O
people O
think O
I O
like O
it O
. O

Wrong O
. O

I O
hate O
things O

and O
I O
love O
flesh O
. O

I O
'm O
convinced O
that O
things O
are O
inhabited O
with O
Gremlins O
. O

It O
's O
a O
vicious O
circle O
. O

The O
more O
stuff O
you O
have O
the O
more O
stuff O
you O
need O
to O
maintain O
it O
, O
like O
the O
Virginia B-GPE
Highways O
. O

It O
starts O
with O
a O
screwdriver O
, O

and O
next O
thing O
you O
know O
it O
's O
a O
shopfull O
of O
air O
compressors O
, O
saws O
, O
welders O
, O
a O
forklift O
, O
an O
earthmover O
, O
a O
dump O
truck O
to O
haul O
the O
earthmover O
..... O

My O
wife O
takes O
great O
glee O
in O
making O
fun O
of O
all O
of O
this O
. O

Then O
I O
pointed O
out O
all O
he O
special O
purpose O
tools O
in O
her O
kithchen O
, O

and O
that O
is O
just O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
job O
. O

She O
carefuly O
forgets O
all O
that O
when O
she O
needs O
something O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
I O
have O
just O
the O
right O
framitz O
to O
manufacture O
a O
repair O
piece O
for O
her O
thing O
- O
a O
- O
bob O
. O

I O
'm O
convinced O
that O
we O
could O
solve O
our O
balance O
of O
payments O
deficits O
if O
we O
just O
passed O
must O
be O
repairable O
laws O
. O

Every O
engineer O
should O
be O
required O
to O
be O
a O
mechanic O
for O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

For O
many O
of O
us O
our O
life O
has O
come O
down O
to O
buy O
it O
at O
Wal B-ORG
- I-ORG
mart I-ORG
and O
take O
it O
to O
the O
dump O
. O

Even O
if O
you O
buy O
it O
at O
the O
BMW B-ORG
or O
John B-ORG
Deere I-ORG
dealer O
it O
is O
no O
different O
. O

So O
, O
if O
PEC B-ORG
wants O
to O
make O
a O
supporter O
out O
of O
me O
, O
the O
way O
to O
do O
it O
is O
to O
start O
a O
campaign O
that O
ensures O
things O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
be O
thrown O
away O
, O
not O
one O
to O
recycle O
them O
at O
a O
loss O
. O

I O

We O
recycle O
all O

items O
such O
as O

When O
I O
speak O
with O
people O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
recycling O
electronic O
items O
, O
they O
are O
very O
ignorant O
. O

I O
think O
more O
than O
anything O
, O
we O
need O
to O
educate O
people O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
recycling O

that O

This O

After O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
apply O
the O
technical O
infomation O
they O
learned O
, O
because O
in O
most O
cases O
they O
lack O
the O
hardware O
and O
facilities O
available O
in O
Taiwan B-GPE

Thus O
they O
are O
only O
able O
to O
apply O
the O
theoretical O
insights O
they O
picked O
up O
to O
their O

Chu B-PERSON

the O

Xu B-PERSON
Xin I-PERSON
also O
has O
a O
set O
of O
unique O
and O
secret O
standards O
for O
selecting O
people O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
check O
if O
the O
entrepreneur O
has O
" O
business O
intuition O
. O
" O

When O
Xu B-PERSON
Xin I-PERSON
first O
invested O
in O
Ding B-PERSON
Lei I-PERSON
of O
Netease B-ORG
, O
he O
was O
the O
first O
one O
to O
enter O
the O
SMS B-ORG
business O
and O
the O
first O
one O
to O
develop O
online O
games O
. O

He O
could O
see O
the O
business O
opportunities O
that O
others O
failed O
to O
see O
. O

He O
could O
persist O
while O
others O
gave O
it O
up O
. O

He O
could O
retreat O
when O
all O
the O
others O
moved O
forward O
with O
the O
trend O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
what O
achievements O
the O
team O
has O
made O
and O
what O
major O
decisions O
it O
has O
gone O
through O
. O

Third B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
ability O
to O
lead O
a O
team O
, O
whether O
the O
entrepreneur O
has O
personal O
charisma O
and O
knows O
how O
to O
manage O
personnel O
. O

With O
10 B-QUANTITY
people I-QUANTITY
under O
him O
, O
the O
leader O
was O
still O
capable O
of O
management O
. O

When O
the O
company O
expanded O
to O
100 B-QUANTITY
people I-QUANTITY
, O
the O
leader O
was O
unable O
to O
manage O
and O
became O
a O
bottleneck O
instead O
. O

To O
investigate O
this O
, O
Xu B-PERSON
Xin I-PERSON
would O
listen O
to O
the O
comments O
from O
his O
competitors O
and O
would O
observe O
his O
assistant O
. O

If O
the O
assistant O
was O
very O
competent O
, O
and O
had O
followed O
him O
many O
years O
, O
this O
shows O
the O
leadership O
of O
this O
person O
is O
not O
bad O
. O

Fourth B-ORDINAL
, O
passion O
is O
a O
must O
. O

Passion O
means O
the O
love O
for O
the O
enterprise O
. O

The O
process O
of O
starting O
a O
business O
is O
always O
very O
tedious O
and O
difficult O
. O

Without O
this O
passion O
, O
it O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
persevere O
nor O
stand O
out O
among O
millions B-QUANTITY
of I-QUANTITY
entrepreneurs I-QUANTITY
. O

Fifth B-ORDINAL
, O
the O
character O
of O
the O
entrepreneur O
must O
be O
open O
, O
transparent O
, O
honest O
, O
and O
reliable O
. O

With O
so O
much O
money O
handed O
over O
to O
him O
for O
management O
, O
could O
this O
not O
be O
taken O
into O
consideration O
? O


%um O
but O
although O
they O
solicit O
, O
they O
're O
trying O
to O
solicit O
more O
throughout O
the O
, O
throughout O
the O
globe O
instead O
of O
just O
Japan B-GPE

mhm O
. O

although O
they O
've O
had O
most O
interest O
in O
Japan B-GPE
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
I O
teach O
probably O
two B-CARDINAL
classes O
and O
then O
do O
administrative O
work O
to O
make O
connections O
for O
these O
people O
to O
have O
tours O
or O
to O
go O
look O
at O
companies O
dealing O
with O
certain O
issues O
that O
they O
're O
working O
on O
in O
their O
classes O
. O

Half O
of O
their O
classes O
are O
business O
half O
are O

So O

's O
really O
groovy O
because O
I O
mean O
I O
have O
all O
these O
contacts O
for O
them O
because O
of O
my O
experience O
in O
the O
business O
world O
here O

And O

be O
related O

the O
sense O

Did O

I O
have O

heard O

%hm O
from O

I O
have O
n't O
heard O
from O
her O
at O
all O
. O

She O
sent O
you O
a O
postcard O
. O

In O
fact O
we O
both O
sent O
you O
postcards O
. O

%ah O
. O

All O
right O
. O

yeah O
. O

You O
know O
what O
? O

What O
? O

I O
just O
came O
back O
from O
the B-GPE
U I-GPE
S I-GPE

and O
I O
have O
some O
letters O
for O
you O
including O
that O
little O
package O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
to O
do O
with O
that O
little O
package O
. O

I O
it O
, O
it O
is O
henna O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
%um O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

Well O
I O
think O
, O

no O
you O
know O
what O
I O
think O
you O
should O
do O
. O

Dorota B-PERSON
please O
. O

Really O
. O

%uh O
. O

The O
package O
of O
henna O
, O
share O
it O
with O
Magda B-PERSON
. O

Magda B-PERSON
is O
gone O

so O
maybe O
I O
'll O
do O
it O
in O
my O
hair O
. O

okay O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
brown O
. O

oh O
is O
it O
? O

Good O
, O
good O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
from O
Florida B-GPE
sent O
that O
to O
me O
. O

%eh O
yeah O
. O

She O
's O
from O
Gainesville B-GPE

Gainesville B-GPE
Florida I-GPE
. O
mhm O
. O

yeah O

And O

yeah O

so O
I O
I O
would O
like O
to O
think O
that O
it O
goes O
to O
a O
good O

because O
sending O
it O
back O
to O
me O
would O
probably O
just O
be O
ludicrous O

so O
you O
know O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
just O

So O
I O
can O
keep O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
opening O
it O
up O
right O
now O
as O
you O
speak O
so O
I O
can O
put O
a O
world O
peace O
stamp O
on O
it O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

All O
right O
. O

All O
right O
. O

You O
know O
what O
? O

I O
've O
been O
saying O
all O
right O
all O
the O
time O
now O
. O

I O
went O

any O
air O
and O
ec- O
electricity O

and O

Mr. O

Mr. O

said O
he O
hopes O
to O
improve O

Ogilvy B-ORG
under O
the O
fastidious O
Mr. O
Roman B-PERSON
gained O
a O
reputation O
as O
occasionally O
being O
high O
- O
handed O
in O
its O
treatment O
of O
clients O
, O
of O
preaching O
what O
strategy O
a O
client O
should O
-- O
indeed O
, O

follow O
. O

And O
some O
of O
its O
top O
client O

service O
executives O
, O
including O
Mr. O
Phillips B-PERSON
, O
were O
promoted O
to O
the O
point O
they O
were O
saddled O
with O
administrative O
duties O
, O
with O
little O
time O
to O
see O
clients O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Phillips B-PERSON
recently O
freed O
himself O
up O
to O
spend O
more O
time O
with O
clients O
by O
delegating O
much O
of O
his O
administrative O
work O
to O
a O
deputy O
. O

He O
also O
plans O
to O
get O
to O
know O
clients O
that O
Mr. O

was O
closer O
to O
, O
such O
as O
Lever B-ORG

The O
two B-CARDINAL
men O
are O

to O
a O

attempt O
to O

`` O
Clients O

two B-CARDINAL

three I-CARDINAL

'' O
he O
said O

Mr. O
Phillips B-PERSON
also O
hopes O
to O
finally O
implement O
a O

announced O
earlier B-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
but O
put O
on O

by O
the O

The O

Under O
the O

Ogilvy B-ORG
plans O
to O
name O
one B-CARDINAL

`` O

'' O
Mr. O
Phillips B-PERSON
complained O
to O
staffers O
in O
March B-DATE
, O
when O
the O
reorganization O
was O
announced O
. O

Now O
Mr. O
Phillips B-PERSON
says O
he O
hopes O
to O
have O
the O

Industry O
executives O
and O
analysts O
are O
divided O
on O
whether O
Mr. O
Phillips B-PERSON
is O
up O
to O
the O
task O
. O

He O
is O
n't O
as O
well O
- O
known O
to O
clients O
as O
is O
Mr. O
Roman B-PERSON
. O

Under O
his O
watch O
, O
office O
politicking O
was O
often O
rampant O
in O
the O
agency O
's O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
operation O
and O
the O
office O
there O
has O
had O
a O
dismal O
new O

for O
more B-DATE

And O
while O

'' O
says O
James B-PERSON
Dougherty I-PERSON
, O
an O

. O

The O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
Mr. O
Phillips B-PERSON
clearly O
does O
have O
going O
for O
him O
is O
continuity O
, O
although O
it O
is O

certain O

that O
will O
be O
enough O

As O
Mr. O
Dougherty B-PERSON
says O
, O
`` O
The O
last O
thing O
they O

is O
enormous O

If O

all O
she O
had O
to O
do O

go O

get O

It O
was O

a O

This O

very O
wrong O

I O

I O
I O
just O

I O

no O

I O

you O

It O

this B-DATE

the B-ORG

decision O
striking O
down O
the O
military O
tribunal O
set O
up O
to O
private O
detainees O
being O
held O
in O
Guantanamo B-FAC
bay O
it O
is O
far O
more O
than O
a O
narrow O
ruling O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
military O
courts O
. O
It O
is O
an O
important O
and O
welcome O
reaffirmation O
That O
even O
in O
times O
of O
war O
the O
law O
is O
what O
the O
constitution O
the O
statuette O
books O
and O
the B-LOC
Geneva I-LOC
convention I-LOC
say O
it O
is O
. O
Not O
what O
the O
President O
wants O
it O
to O
be O
. O

Senator O
in O
a O
broader O
sense O
is O
n't O
this O
a O
a O
real O
rebuke O
out O
of O
repudiation O
of O
the O
broad O
authority O
That O
the O
president O
's O
been O
claiming O
since O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
? O

Well O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
most O
importantly O
the O
decision O
did O
not O
require O
the O
President O
to O
release O
the O
prisoners O
at O
Guantanamo B-EVENT
. O

Nor O
did O
it O
require O
the O
president O
to O
close O
Guantanamo B-FAC
. O

Correct O
. O

It O
said O
that O
uh O
in O
order O
to O
try O
these O
individuals O
by O
an O
appropriate O
thing O
to O
do O
would O
be O
for O
the O
President O
to O
get O
the O
Congress B-ORG
uh O
to O
create O
military O
commission O
. O

Or O
there O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
other O
options O
Both O
of O
which O
I O
think O
were O
clearly O
unacceptable O
. O

So O
what O
I O
think O
Congress B-ORG
will O
be O
doing O
is O
creating O
military O
commission O
. O

And O
second B-ORDINAL
a O
very O
disturbing O
aspect O
of O
the O
decision O
was O
that O
the O
court O
held O
uh O
common O
article B-LAW
three I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
Geneva I-LAW
convention I-LAW
applicable O
to O
um O
American B-NORP
service O
men O
. O

And O
this O
means O
that O
American B-NORP
service O
men O
potentially O
can O
be O
accused O
of O
war O
crimes O
. O

I O
think O
Congress B-ORG
is O
going O
to O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
that O
as O
well O
when O
it O
enacts O
these O
military O
commissions O
. O

And O
I O
think O
we O
need O
to O
do O
it O
soon O
. O

uh O
and O
so O
we O
'll O
be O
dealing O
with O
that O
in O
the B-DATE
coming I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

You O
you O
have O
time O
? O

you O
won- O
-- O
you O
're O
going O
off O
now O
? O

Are O
you O
off O
now O
? O

There O
's O
nothing O
more O
important O
than O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

And O
I O
think O
uh O
we O
will O
have O
to O
act O
on O
this O
very O
soon O
either O
in O
July B-DATE
or O
in O
September B-DATE
Certainly O
uh O
in O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

Senator O
Schumer B-PERSON
will O
this O
be O
a O
bipartisan O
effort O
? O

And O
can O
you O
agree O
on O
the O
fix O
? O

I O
think O
it O
will O
. O

uh O
Look O
let O
's O
face O
it O
Andrea B-PERSON
. O

The O
world O
is O
a O
different O
place O
. O

And O
in O
this O
war O
on O
terrorism O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
set O
battlefields O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
the O
enemy O
wearing O
uniforms O
. O

So O
to O
change O
things O
that O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
this B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
has O
felt O
it O
could O
just O
change O
things O
unilateral O
Against O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
against O
the O
systems O
of O
checks O
and O
balances O
. O

Had O
they O
come O
to O
Congress B-ORG
a O
few O
years O
on O
this O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
on O
this O
issue O
my O
guess O
is O
they O
would O
have O
gotten O
most O
of O
what O
they O
wanted O
. O

But O
what O
's O
happened O
here O
, O
because O
there O
is O
such O
a O
view O
that O
the O
President O
's O
power O
is O
infinite O
and O
unchecked O
by O
anybody O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
ever O
a O
President O
has O
had O
those O
kinds O
of O
views O
they O
keep O
running O
into O
brick O
walls O
In O
this O
case O
a B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
that O
has O
generally O
been O
sympathetic O
to O
executive O
power O
. O

And O
so O
we O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
not O
only O
look O
at O
this O
issue O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
go O
back O
to O
the O
other O
issues O
as O
well O
Because O
this O
ruling O
undercuts O
some O
of O
the O
other O
things O
the O
President O
has O
done O
. O

But O
on O
giving O
the O
President O
what O
he O
needs O
and O
giving O
our O
country O
what O
we O
need O
to O
fight O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
there O
's O
going O
to O
be O
g- O
agreement O
. O

Well O
let O
's O
break O
it O
down O
here O
Because O
this O
ruling O
does O
indicate O
to O
some O
human O
rights O
groups O
that O
this O
applies O
to O
the O
prisoners O
in O
secret O
CIA B-ORG
prisons O
to O
the O
prisoners O
in O
Afghanistan B-GPE
Beyond O
Guantanamo B-FAC
. O

Are O
we O
going O
to O
see O
a O
flood O
of O
habeas O
corpus O
petitions O
now O
Senator O
McConnell B-PERSON
? O

Well O
I O
think O
clearly O
we O
've O
got O
to O
act O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
pleased O
to O
hear O
that O
Chuck B-PERSON
thinks O
that O
we O
may O
be O
able O
to O
do O
this O
on O
a O
bipartisan O
basis O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
important O
to O
note O
that O
this O
president O
has O
n't O
done O
anything O
with O
regard O
to O
enemy O
combatants O
that O
have O
been O
done O
-- O
that O
had O
n't O
been O
done O
by O
previous O
presidents O
. O

The O
Court B-ORG
now O
has O
stepped O
into O
a O
-- O
eh O
eh O
into O
the O
field O
And O
said O
we O
must O
create O
these O
commissions O
. O

Well O
we O
're O
happy O
to O
do O
that O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
hopeful O
it O
'll O
be O
done O
on O
a O
bipartisan O
basis O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
we O
're O
going O
to O
pass O
something O
that O
's O
going O
to O
have O
our O
military O
servicemen O
uh O
subject O
uh O
to O
some O
kind O
of O
international O
rules O
. O

Of O
course O
not O
. O

But O
we O
are O
signatories O
to O
the B-LAW
Geneva I-LAW
Conventions I-LAW
. O

Why O
should O
n't O
our O
servicemen O
be O
- O

But O
the O
-- O
but O
the O
-- O
but O
the O
enemy O
is O
not O
a O
signatory O
to O
the O
-- O
to O
the O
-- O
to O
the B-LAW
Geneva I-LAW
Conventions I-LAW
. O

So O
why O
should O
these O
uh O
terrorists O
uh O
be O
subjected O
uh O
to O
something O
they O
're O
not O
signatories O
to O
? O

The O
good O
news O
Andrea B-PERSON
is O
that O
the O
Court B-ORG
particularly O
Breyer B-PERSON
's O
decision O
said O
Congress B-ORG
could O
change O
the O
rules O
. O

And O
we O
have O
to O
change O
the O
rules O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
's O
disagreement O
on O
that O
. O

And O
we O
will O
. O

Security O
and O
liberty O
have O
a O
tenuous O
and O
careful O
balance O
in O
this O
republic O
. O

It O
changes O
from O
time O
to O
time O
And O
should O
. O

But O
the O
problem O
here O
again O
- O

you O
're O
right O
. O

There O
're O
going O
to O
be O
hundreds B-CARDINAL
of O
court O
petitions O
. O

This O
is O
going O
to O
create O
huge O
discombobulation O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
be O
far O
worse O
off O
than O
if O
the O
administration O
had O
come O
to O
Congress B-ORG
originally O
and O
gotten O
this O
done O
. O

But O
this O
view O
-- O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
Mitch B-PERSON
here O
This O
view O
that O
the O
President O
has O
the O
sole O
right O
based O
on O
a O
-- O
the O
use O
of O
military O
force O
doctrine O
when O
none O
of O
this O
was O
even O
discussed O
or O
mentioned O
is O
the O
wrong O
view O
. O

and O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
said O
it O
. O

Andrea B-PERSON
could O
I O
just O
- O

Senator O
McConnell B-PERSON
should O
Guantanamo B-FAC
now O
just O
be O
closed O
? O

No O
I O
d- O
I O
I O
- O

Because O
it O
's O
just O
been O
such O
a O
black O
eye O
diplomatically O
. O

What O
are O
we O
-- O
what O
are O
we O
going O
to O
do O
with O
these O
people O
? O

I O
mean O
we O
want O
them O
to O
free O
them O
so O
they O
can O
come O
kill O
us O
again O
? O

Look O
I O
I O
think O
the O
Congress B-ORG
is O
very O
very O
likely O
to O
give O
the O
President O
exactly O
what O
he O
thinks O
he O
needs O
to O
continue O
to O
fight O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

And O
it O
's O
important O
for O
all O
of O
us O
to O
remember O
that O
we O
have O
n't O
been O
attacked O
again O
here O
at O
home O
again O
since O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
. O

That O
's O
not O
an O
accident O
. O

It O
's O
not O
an O
accident O
. O

The O
policies O
that O
we O
've O
pursued O
are O
protecting O
us O
here O
at O
home O
. O

But O
is O
this O
Court B-ORG
ruling O
a O
strong O
signal O
to O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
that O
it O
should O
now O
agree O
with O
Senator O
McCain B-PERSON
Senator O
Lindsey B-PERSON
Graham I-PERSON
and O
and O
others O
in O
your O
party O
who O
believe O
that O
it O
should O
go O
in O
-- O
go O
along O
with O
the B-LAW
Geneva I-LAW
Convention I-LAW
in O
terms O
of O
rules O
of O
the O
road O
for O
our O
soldiers O
? O

I O
think O
Congress B-ORG
is O
going O
to O
be O
very O
reluctant O
to O
subject O
American B-NORP
military O
people O
to O
potential O
war O
crimes O
uh O
violations O
. O

So O
John B-PERSON
McCain I-PERSON
is O
wrong O
on O
this O
? O

Well O
we O
'll O
see O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
have O
-- O
w- O
we O
're O
looking O
for O
the O
administration O
's O
advice O
about O
what O
they O
need O
to O
fight O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

My O
guess O
is O
that O
the O
Congress B-ORG
is O
very O
likely O
to O
give O
the O
President O
what O
he O
thinks O
he O
needs O
the O
tools O
he O
thinks O
he O
needs O
to O
protect O
us O
here O
at O
home O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
quite O
that O
simple O
. O

I O
think O
that O
there O
will O
be O
a O
careful O
looking O
again O
at O
what O
certain O
due O
process O
elements O
are O
that O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
and O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
has O
required O
in O
the O
past O
. O

But O
giving O
the O
President O
the O
tool O
he O
needs O
yes O
. O

But O
there O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
other O
thing O
that O
ought O
to O
be O
done O
Andrea B-PERSON
given O
the O
sweeping O
nature O
of O
this O
decision O
not O
so O
much O
on O
the O
specifics O
of O
what O
can O
be O
done O
But O
on O
how O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
done O
. O

I O
think O
-- O
I O
've O
-- O
I O
've O
sent O
a O
letter O
today O
to O
Attorney O
General O
Gonzales B-PERSON
asking O
that O
they O
do O
a O
review O
now O
in O
light O
of O
this O
decision O
of O
all O
their O
other O
abrogations O
of O
power O
So O
we O
avoid O
this O
mess O
again O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
later I-DATE
on O
these O
other O
issues O
Whether O
it O
's O
wire O
taps O
or O
anything O
else O
Where O
the O
administration O
just O
said O
unilaterally O
we O
can O
do O
whatever O
we O
want O
. O

That O
is O
not O
how O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
works O
. O

Well O
let O
me O
turn O
to O
another O
controversy O
which O
is O
the O
battle O
over O
national O
security O
leaks O
. O

The O
House B-ORG
voted O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
on O
a O
resolution O
condemning O
the O
publication O
by O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
and O
several O
other O
newspapers O
particularly O
though O
The O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
. O

Now O
the O
resolution O
said O
The B-ORG
House I-ORG
of I-ORG
Representatives I-ORG
expects O
the O
cooperation O
of O
all O
news O
media O
organizations O
in O
protecting O
the O
lives O
of O
Americans B-NORP
And O
the O
capability O
of O
the O
government O
to O
identify O
disrupt O
and O
capture O
terrorists O
by O
not O
disclosing O
classified O
intelligence O
programs O
such O
as O
the B-ORG
Terrorist I-ORG
Finance I-ORG
Tracking I-ORG
Program I-ORG
. O

Representative O
Peter B-PERSON
King I-PERSON
a O
Republican B-NORP
of O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
said O
If O
there O
is O
another O
terror O
attack O
the O
blood O
will O
be O
on O
their O
hands O
Meaning O
on O
the O
editors O
and O
reporters O
of O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
and O
elsewhere O
. O

The O
President O
expressed O
anger O
over O
this O
. O

Let O
's O
give O
a O
listen O
to O
that O
. O

The O
disclosure O
of O
this O
program O
is O
disgraceful O
. O

We O
're O
at O
war O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
people O
who O
want O
to O
hurt O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
. O

And O
for O
people O
to O
leak O
that O
program O
and O
for O
a O
newspaper O
to O
publish O
it O
does O
great O
harm O
to O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
. O

Senator O
Schumer B-PERSON
on O
January B-DATE
first I-DATE
you O
said O
that O
an- O
about O
an O
earlier O
leak O
regarding O
the O
NSA B-ORG
surveillance O
that O
quote O
Whenever O
classified O
information O
is O
leaked O
there O
ought O
to O
be O
an O
investigation O
because O
it O
could O
endanger O
our O
security O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
I O
would O
presume O
you O
now O
would O
agree O
with O
the O
President O
that O
this O
leak O
should O
also O
be O
investigated O
. O

Well O
it O
certainly O
should O
be O
investigated O
. O

But O
the O
President O
and O
others O
have O
gone O
way O
overboard O
. O

How O
so O
? O

um O
How O
so O
? O

Look O
we O
believe O
in O
a O
free O
press O
in O
this O
country O
. O

The O
press O
is O
often O
antagonistic O
or O
uh O
l- O
probing O
of O
people O
in O
power O
. O

We O
all O
do O
n't O
like O
that O
. O

But O
it O
's O
part O
of O
America B-GPE
. O

And O
as O
a O
founding O
father O
said O
when O
they O
first B-ORDINAL
wrote O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
true O
to O
this O
day O
that O
's O
a O
good O
thing O
for O
America B-GPE
. O

ther- O
ec- O
There O
are O
exceptions O
. O

One O
is O
if O
it O
harms O
national O
security O
. O

Now O
all O
of O
these O
statements O
by O
the O
President O
and O
others O
are O
jumping O
the O
gun O
. O

We O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
harmed O
national O
security O
. O

In O
fact O
I O
've O
been O
on O
the B-ORG
Banking I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
for O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

It O
is O
broad O
public O
knowledge O
stated O
by O
administration O
officials O
- O

Have O
you O
been O
briefed O
on O
this O
? O

I O
have O
not O
been O
briefed O
privately O
on O
this O
program O
. O

but O
we O
've O
had O
people O
come O
before O
the B-ORG
Banking I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
uh O
publicly O
from O
Treasury B-ORG
and O
other O
departments O
. O

And O
this O
is O
-- O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
has O
made O
statements O
, O
others O
have O
made O
statements O
, O
that O
we O
monitor O
and O
track O
terrorist O
financing O
. O

It O
's O
been O
successful O
. O

Well O
. O

So O
that O
you O
uh O
look O
at O
the O
reports O
, O
the O
terrorists O
do O
n't O
use O
the O
banks O
as O
much O
. O

So O
to O
jump O
out O
front O
and O
just O
blast O
a O
newspaper O
that O
they O
may O
not O
like O
that O
to O
me O
is O
totally O
wrong O
. O

It O
's O
-- O
it O
's O
the O
guilty O
verdict O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

And O
the O
the O
trial O
. O

Mitch O
uh O
Pat B-PERSON
Roberts I-PERSON
has O
called O
for O
an O
investigation O
. O

Fine O
let O
it O
be O
a O
fair O
- O

The O
head O
of O
the B-ORG
Senate I-ORG
Intelligence I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
. O

Yeah O
. O

Let O
it O
be O
a O
fair O
and O
down O
the O
middle O
investigation O
. O

My O
guess O
It O
will O
find O
that O
national O
security O
was O
not O
compromised O
a O
jot O
. O

Well O
let O
me O
pick O
up O
on O
- O

because O
Treasury O
Secretary O
Snow B-PERSON
took O
a O
group O
of O
reporters O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
Afghanistan B-GPE
and O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
to O
show O
off O
how O
they O
were O
tracking O
terror O
financing O
. O

So O
Senator O
McConnell B-PERSON
do O
they O
want O
to O
have O
it O
both O
ways O
? O

Do O
they O
want O
to O
brag O
about O
their O
success O
record O
in O
tracking O
this O
financing O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
yell O
and O
scream O
about O
the O
reporters O
when O
they O
print O
the O
source O
? O

Well O
look O
I O
think O
the O
leaks O
are O
abominable O
. O

And O
printing O
of O
the O
leaks O
is O
certainly O
trouble O
. O

You O
can O
talk O
in O
general O
about O
what O
we O
're O
doing O
without O
revealing O
the O
specifics O
. O

And O
I O
think O
we O
all O
regret O
that O
the O
-- O
uh O
that O
the O
times O
and O
other O
publications O
chose O
to O
do O
that O
. O

And O
uh O
I O
think O
the O
President O
essentially O
had O
it O
correctly O
. O

Well O
let O
me O
show O
you O
a O
joint O
statement O
that O
was O
on O
the O
oped O
pages O
of O
both O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
and O
The B-ORG
Los I-ORG
Angeles I-ORG
Times I-ORG
yesterday B-DATE
. O

The O
editors O
of O
those O
newspapers O
wrote O
the O
banking O
articles O
did O
not O
dwell O
on O
the O
operational O
or O
technical O
aspects O
of O
the O
program O
but O
on O
its O
sweep O
The O
questions O
about O
its O
legal O
basis O
and O
the O
issues O
of O
oversight O
. O

We O
understand O
that O
honorable O
people O
may O
disagree O
with O
any O
of O
these O
choices O
to O
publish O
or O
not O
to O
publish O
. O

But O
making O
those O
decisions O
is O
the O
responsibility O
that O
falls O
to O
editors O
A O
corollary O
to O
the O
great O
gift O
of O
our O
independence O
. O

It O
is O
not O
a O
responsibility O
we O
take O
lightly O
. O

And O
it O
is O
not O
one O
we O
can O
surrender O
to O
the O
government O
. O

After O
that O
in O
fact O
The O
Wall O
Street O
Journal O
attacked O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
on O
its O
editorial O
pages O
Friday B-DATE
. O

So O
this O
was O
clearly O
a O
response O
to O
that O
. O

uh O
Even O
though O
the O
Journal B-ORG
had O
itself O
published O
uh O
the O
same O
story O
about O
terror O
financing O
in O
its O
news O
columns O
which O
is O
separate O
from O
its O
editorial O
pages O
. O

Senator O
McConnell B-PERSON
has O
the O
administration O
and O
its O
conservative O
supporters O
now O
embarked O
on O
a O
calculated O
campaign O
to O
demonize O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
and O
other O
newspapers O
but O
particularly O
The O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
as O
a O
political O
calculus O
because O
it O
'll O
help O
in O
the O
midterm O
elections O
? O

Look O
eh O
eh O
newspapers O
are O
very O
very O
important O
in O
our O
-- O
in O
our O
country O
. O

The O
media O
is O
important O
. O

And O
we O
have O
a O
free O
press O
. O

But O
the O
press O
is O
not O
responsible O
for O
our O
national O
security O
. O

That O
's O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
President O
and O
the B-ORG
Department I-ORG
of I-ORG
Defense I-ORG
and O
the O
other O
agencies O
that O
look O
after O
us O
. O

And O
I O
think O
it O
's O
important O
for O
the O
leaders O
of O
the O
principle O
outlets O
in O
the O
press O
in O
this O
country O
to O
be O
responsible O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
uh O
this O
publishing O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
information O
is O
helpful O
. O

And O
nor O
do O
I O
think O
it O
is O
necessary O
uh O
in O
um O
doing O
their O
job O
. O

Andrea O
let O
me O
say O
a O
couple O
of O
things O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
you O
asked O
about O
a O
double O
standard O
. O

There O
clearly O
is O
a O
double O
standard O
. O

It O
's O
with O
the O
administration O
. O

They O
leak O
things O
they O
want O
to O
leak O
. O

And O
when O
the O
Plame B-PERSON
leak O
came O
out O
there O
was O
no O
outrage O
. O

there O
was O
no O
high O
dudgeon O
. O

In O
fact O
regardless O
of O
the O
criminal O
standard O
which O
uh O
special O
prosecutor O
Fitzgerald B-PERSON
is O
handling O
it O
's O
clear O
that O
there O
were O
leaks O
. O

There O
's O
been O
no O
punishment O
no O
outcry O
etcetera O
. O

I O
mean O
you O
ca O
n't O
have O
it O
both O
ways O
And O
use O
leaks O
when O
you O
want O
to O
And O
do O
n't O
use O
leaks O
when O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

But O
there O
's O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
point O
here O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
difficult O
situations O
and O
clearly O
Iraq B-GPE
now O
is O
one B-CARDINAL
And O
uh O
this O
administration O
has O
a O
penchant O
for O
diversion O
and O
scapegoating O
. O

And O
here O
's O
the O
good O
news O
the O
good O
news O
for O
America B-GPE
and O
I O
think O
the O
good O
news O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

They O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

They O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
in O
the O
war O
on O
terrorism O
where O
Afghanistan B-GPE
is O
deteriorating O
right O
now O
. O

And O
I O
think O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
are O
tired O
and O
see O
through O
these O
diversions O
. O

They O
want O
real O
solutions O
. O

They O
want O
real O
progress O
. O

Let O
's O
talk O
about O
real O
solutions O
Senator O
Because O
Democrats B-NORP
are O
sharply O
divided O
over O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
only O
thirteen B-CARDINAL
Senate B-ORG
Democrats B-NORP
supported O
the B-LAW
Kerry I-LAW
- I-LAW
Feingold I-LAW
amendment I-LAW
by O
Senators O
Kerry B-PERSON
and O
Feingold B-PERSON
calling O
for O
an O
immediate O
withdrawal O
. O

You O
were O
not O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
. O

But O
as O
the O
party O
's O
Campaign O
Chairman O
for O
the O
Senate B-ORG
campaign O
does O
n't O
that O
amendment O
make O
Democrats B-NORP
look O
weak O
? O

Not O
at O
all O
. O

You O
know O
what O
our O
job O
is O
? O

Look O
the O
President O
is O
Commander O
in O
Chief O
. O

By O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
and O
everything O
else O
is O
in O
charge O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

He O
got O
us O
in O
there O
. O

he O
's O
got O
to O
figure O
a O
way O
out O
. O

Our O
job O
our O
job O
is O
oversight O
. O

Our O
job O
is O
holding O
people O
accountable O
. O

so O
wait O
a B-TIME
second I-TIME
. O

you O
're O
going O
to O
the O
election O
to O
to O
the O
voters O
in O
November B-DATE
. O

Right O
. O

Do O
n't O
you O
also O
have O
the O
job O
as O
Campaign O
Chairman O
for O
Democrats B-NORP
of O
presenting O
an O
alternative O
? O

Let O
me O
say O
this O
. O

I O
think O
what O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
want O
is O
for O
the O
Congress B-ORG
to O
hold O
the O
President O
's O
feet O
to O
the O
fire O
. O

Now O
we O
did O
present O
an O
alternative O
The O
one O
that O
a O
vast O
majority O
of O
Democrats B-NORP
voted O
for O
including O
some O
who O
voted O
for O
the O
other O
one O
which O
said O
it O
was O
drafted O
by O
Senator O
Levin B-PERSON
and O
Senator O
Jack B-PERSON
Reed I-PERSON
of O
Rhode B-GPE
Island I-GPE
. O

And O
it O
basically O
said O
we O
're O
going O
to O
tell O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
in O
a O
period O
of O
time O
not O
public O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
set O
a O
specific O
deadline O
that O
's O
what O
the O
resolution O
did O
n't O
like O
that O
we O
are O
not O
go O
this O
commitment O
is O
not O
open O
- O
ended O
and O
they O
better O
get O
their O
act O
together O
or O
they O
're O
not O
going O
to O
keep O
us O
there O
. O

But O
make O
no O
mistake O
about O
it O
Andrea B-PERSON
. O

A O
minority O
party O
in O
the O
Congress B-ORG
has O
a O
job O
. O

The O
job O
is O
one O
of O
oversighting O
accountability O
. O

We O
are O
not O
the O
Commander O
in O
Chief O
. O

We O
are O
not O
in O
charge O
of O
all O
of O
those O
things O
. O

No O
. O

So O
to O
set O
guidelines O
, O
to O
set O
a O
general O
direction O
the O
way O
we O
did O
in O
the B-LAW
Reed I-LAW
- I-LAW
Levin I-LAW
amendment I-LAW
is O
correct O
. O

I O
think O
what O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
are O
most O
upset O
about O
is O
the O
Republican B-NORP
Congress B-ORG
is O
not O
holding O
the O
President O
's O
feet O
to O
the O
fire O
at O
all O
. O

With O
all O
due O
respect O
But O
with O
all O
due O
respect O
when O
we O
talk O
about O
the O
politics O
of O
this O
Senator O
Chris B-PERSON
Dodd I-PERSON
who O
has O
said O
he O
's O
considering O
running O
for O
president O
said O
that O
in O
fact O
the O
Kenned- O
-- O
excuse O
me O
the B-LAW
Kerry I-LAW
- I-LAW
Feingold I-LAW
amendment I-LAW
hurts O
rather O
than O
helps O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Party I-ORG
. O

Oh O
I O
do O
n't O
buy O
that O
. O

And O
this O
is O
what O
Senator O
Feingold B-PERSON
said O
to O
Tim B-PERSON
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
about O
those O
like O
yourself O
who O
voted O
against O
it O
. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
the O
one O
thing O
I O
'm O
sure O
of O
Tim O
is O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
have O
had O
it O
with O
this O
intervention O
. O

They O
do O
want O
a O
timetable O
for O
bringing O
home O
the O
troops O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
the O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
Senate B-ORG
does O
n't O
get O
it O
should O
n't O
surprise O
you O
. O

So O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
Democratic B-NORP
Senate B-ORG
is O
out O
of O
touch O
with O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
. O

Yes O
it O
is O
at O
this O
point O
. O

Those O
who O
vote O
against O
bringing O
the O
troops O
home O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O

They O
're O
not O
out O
there O
enough O
. O

They O
're O
not O
listening O
to O
the O
people O
. O

How O
do O
you O
go O
to O
the O
-- O
to O
the O
p- O
-- O
the O
to O
the O
people O
in O
November B-DATE
when O
Democrats B-NORP
do O
n't O
have O
an O
agreed O
upon O
policy O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
? O

Very O
s- O
- O

But O
we O
do O
. O

The O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
Democrats B-NORP
supported O
the B-LAW
Levin I-LAW
- I-LAW
Reed I-LAW
resolution I-LAW
which O
called O
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
transition O
And O
said O
tell O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
it O
's O
not O
open O
- O
ended O
. O

But O
I O
would O
say O
this O
. O

The O
ball O
if O
you O
're O
talking O
about O
the O
election O
in O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
and I-DATE
six I-DATE
is O
in O
the O
President O
's O
court O
. O

All O
of O
the O
debates O
in O
the O
Congress B-ORG
this O
resolution O
that O
resolution O
when O
is O
are O
not O
going O
to O
-- O
are O
going O
to O
pale O
in O
significance O
before O
how O
things O
are O
going O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

And O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
every O
poll O
shows O
and O
it O
's O
common O
sense O
hold O
the O
President O
responsible O
. O

Senator O
McConnell B-PERSON
let O
me O
ask O
you O
about O
something O
that O
you O
said O
during O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
month I-DATE
of O
the O
war O
back O
in O
April B-DATE
of I-DATE
two I-DATE
thousand I-DATE
three I-DATE
. O

American B-NORP
success O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
showed O
that O
armchair O
generals O
and O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
reporters O
were O
wrong O
in O
their O
assessments O
of O
how O
difficult O
the O
war O
would O
be O
. O

rebuilding O
Iraq B-GPE
will O
be O
much O
easier O
than O
rebuilding O
Afghanistan B-GPE
he O
said O
Because O
Iraq B-GPE
has O
a O
well O
educated O
population O
and O
the O
oil O
to O
finance O
reconstruction O
. O

Iraq B-GPE
has O
the O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
jewel O
in O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
. O

Was O
that O
a O
miscalculation O
on O
your O
part O
reflecting O
what O
the O
administration O
's O
miscalculation O
was O
? O

Well O
certainly O
the O
uh O
the O
taking O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
was O
went O
as O
expected O
. O

The O
aftermath O
has O
been O
much O
more O
difficult O
. O

the O
fact O
that O
it O
's O
gone O
on O
a O
while O
creates O
the O
kind O
of O
debates O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
are O
having O
among O
themselves O
over O
whether O
we O
get O
out O
by O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
or O
get O
out O
by O
next B-DATE
summer I-DATE
or O
begin O
to O
get O
out O
at O
some O
point O
. O

And O
people O
do O
become O
impatient O
. O

But O
it O
's O
important O
to O
remember O
Andrea B-PERSON
The O
most O
important O
thing O
. O

We O
have O
n't O
been O
attacked O
again O
here O
since O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
. O

We O
've O
been O
on O
offense O
. O

We O
've O
invaded O
Afghanistan B-GPE
Invaded O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

There O
're O
democratic O
governments O
now O
in O
both O
places O
. O

Is O
it O
easy O
there O
? O

No O
it O
is O
n't O
. O

But O
these O
are O
the O
same O
kinds O
of O
people O
who O
attacked O
us O
here O
i- O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

They O
've O
not O
been O
able O
to O
do O
that O
again O
because O
the O
President O
made O
the O
fundamentally O
correct O
decision O
to O
get O
on O
offense O
. O

And O
we O
've O
gone O
after O
these O
people O
where O
they O
-- O
Somewhere O
else O
Fighting O
them O
in O
places O
like O
Kabul B-GPE
and O
Baghdad B-GPE
so O
we O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
have O
them O
again O
in O
Washington B-GPE
and O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
. O

I O
think O
that O
's O
been O
a O
fundamentally O
sound O
decision O
. O

I O
think O
we O
're O
succeeding O
. O

Let O
me O
briefly O
turn O
to O
immigration O
. O

uh O
Gentlemen O
there O
is O
now O
talk O
of O
a O
possible O
compromise O
which O
would O
have O
a O
two B-CARDINAL
step O
process O
where O
you O
would O
delay O
guest O
workers O
for O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
perhaps O
As O
long O
as O
that O
But O
first B-ORDINAL
do O
the O
border O
security O
. O

uh O
Senator O
McConnell B-PERSON
you O
've O
been O
trying O
to O
support O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
. O

But O
is O
this O
something O
where O
you O
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
Republicans B-NORP
could O
move O
toward O
the O
House B-ORG
position O
and O
come O
up O
with O
something O
before O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
? O

Well O
I O
'd O
rather O
have O
a O
comprehensive O
bill O
than O
not O
. O

and O
I O
think O
it O
needs O
to O
tilt O
toward O
uh O
border O
security O
. O

uh O
We O
're O
in O
the O
process O
of O
beefing O
up O
border O
security O
anyway O
through O
our O
appropriations O
process O
Whether O
or O
not O
we O
're O
able O
to O
achieve O
a O
comprehensive O
immigration O
settlement O
. O

But O
we O
're O
better O
to O
have O
this O
bill O
than O
not O
. O

And O
my O
my O
preference O
is O
- O

And O
Senator O
Schumer B-PERSON
I O
see O
you O
're O
nodding O
in O
agreement O
. O

Yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
problem O
here O
Mitch B-PERSON
McConnell I-PERSON
Chuck B-PERSON
Schumer I-PERSON
George B-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
supported O
the O
bill O
that O
came O
out O
of O
the O
Senate B-ORG
. O

But O
you O
ra- O
you O
'd O
rather O
have O
something O
than O
nothing O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tough O
bill O
. O

and O
it O
's O
a O
fair O
bill O
. O

But O
here O
's O
what O
's O
happening O
. O

There O
's O
a O
who- O
-- O
you O
know O
there O
's O
a O
wing O
of O
the B-ORG
Republican I-ORG
Party I-ORG
that O
does O
n't O
want O
that O
bill O
. O

They O
tend O
to O
be O
more O
in O
the O
House B-ORG
than O
the O
Senate B-ORG
. O

And O
they O
're O
trying O
to O
hold O
things O
up O
. O

They O
're O
having O
these O
hearings O
. O

Well O
we O
've O
had O
hearing O
hearing O
hearing O
. O

But O
now O
it O
looks O
like O
we O
may O
shortcircuit O
that O
. O

The O
American B-NORP
people O
want O
a O
solution O
. O

Senator O
Schumer B-PERSON
as O
you O
well O
know O
in O
Connecticut B-GPE
your O
colleague O
and O
friend O
and O
former O
vice-presidential O
candidate O
Joe B-PERSON
Lieberman I-PERSON
has O
a O
heated O
primary O
race O
on O
his O
hands O
against O
anti-war O
candidate O
Ned B-PERSON
Lamont I-PERSON
. O

Now O
let O
me O
show O
you O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
new O
ad O
that O
the O
Lamont B-PERSON
campaign O
is O
airing O
which O
morphs O
Joe B-PERSON
Lieberman I-PERSON
with O
uh O
pictures O
of O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
. O

Joe B-PERSON
Lieberman I-PERSON
on O
the O
Iraq B-GPE
war O
. O

We O
are O
now O
at O
a O
point O
where O
the O
war O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
is O
a O
war O
of O
necessity O
. O

Joe B-PERSON
Leiberman I-PERSON
may O
say O
he O
represents O
us O
. O

But O
if O
it O
talks O
like O
George B-PERSON
W I-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
and O
acts O
like O
George B-PERSON
W I-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
it O
's O
certainly O
not O
a O
Connecticut B-GPE
Democrat B-NORP
. O

Okay O
as O
Campaign O
Chairman O
will O
you O
now O
today B-DATE
commit O
to O
supporting O
whoever O
wins O
that O
Democratic B-NORP
primary O
in O
Connecticut B-GPE
where O
he O
is O
now O
facing O
that O
t- O
uh O
tough O
challenge O
? O

Well O
let O
me O
say O
this O
Andrea B-PERSON
. O

Harry B-PERSON
Reid I-PERSON
myself O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Senate I-ORG
Campaign I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
in O
this O
primary O
are O
supporting O
Joe B-PERSON
Lieberman I-PERSON
. O

And O
we O
're O
doing O
everything O
we O
can O
to O
help O
him O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
speculate O
on O
what O
happens O
after O
the O
primary O
Because O
we O
believe O
Joe B-PERSON
Leiberman I-PERSON
is O
going O
to O
win O
. O

And O
it O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
undermine O
my O
candidate O
by O
speculating O
about O
what O
might O
happen O
afterwards O
. O

We O
think O
he O
's O
going O
to O
win O
. O

And O
we O
're O
supporting O
him O
in O
the O
primaries O
. O

You O
're O
supporting O
him O
even O
though O
his O
position O
on O
the O
war O
is O
completely O
contrary O
to O
most O
most O
Democrats B-NORP
? O

Well O
again O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Party I-ORG
is O
united O
in O
holding O
the O
President O
's O
feet O
to O
the O
fire O
on O
oversight O
. O

But O
why O
wo O
n't O
you O
commit O
today O
to O
supporting O
Joe B-PERSON
Lieberman I-PERSON
the O
former O
vice-presidential O
nominee O
? O

But O
- O

Because O
- O

You O
're O
basically O
saying O
that O
you O
will O
support O
the O
Democrat B-NORP
whoever O
wins O
? O

I O
am O
saying O
that O
we O
are O
supporting O
Joe B-PERSON
Lieberman I-PERSON
in O
the O
primary O
. O

But O
only O
for O
the O
primary O
. O

And O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
speculate O
about O
things O
afterwards O
. O

Because O
that O
undermines O
your O
candidate O
. O

We O
're O
supporting O
Joe B-PERSON
. O

He O
's O
going O
to O
win O
. O

Are O
you O
suggesting O
that O
you O
might O
not O
support O
the O
Democratic B-NORP
winner O
? O

As O
as O
I O
said O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
speculate O
on O
the O
future O
Because O
we O
're O
for O
Joe B-PERSON
Leiberman I-PERSON
in O
this O
primary O
. O

We O
're O
talking O
about O
what O
the O
definition O
of O
is O
is O
here O
. O

But O
- O

Well O
there O
you O
go O
. O

So O
Joe B-PERSON
Lieberman I-PERSON
up O
through O
the O
primary O
. O

and O
then O
he O
's O
on O
his O
own O
? O

We O
're O
not O
speculating O
after O
the O
primary O
. O

What O
if O
he O
runs O
as O
an O
independent O
? O

We O
're O
not O
speculating O
after O
the O
primary O
. O

It O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
. O

When O
you O
have O
a O
candidate O
you O
're O
supporting O
you O
do O
n't O
say O
what O
happens O
if O
he O
does O
n't O
win O
? O

Andrea B-PERSON
? O

Yes O
. O

Could O
I O
just O
say O
this O
illustrates O
the O
nature O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
Democrat B-NORP
's O
problem O
. O

Weigh O
weigh O
weigh O
in O
on O
this O
one O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
you O
'll O
want O
to O
. O

Weigh O
in O
. O

Joe B-PERSON
Lieberman I-PERSON
voted O
against O
all O
of O
their O
cut O
- O
and O
- O
run O
proposals O
All O
of O
them O
. O

He O
supports O
the O
President O
in O
his O
war O
on O
terror O
And O
in O
the O
uh O
Iraqi B-NORP
r- O
uh O
chapter O
of O
that O
. O

And O
it O
creates O
a O
real O
dilemma O
. O

The O
Democrats B-NORP
are O
obviously O
totally O
divided O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
how O
to O
handle O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

Well O
let O
me O
help O
you O
get O
off O
the O
- O

Andrea B-PERSON
wait O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
that O
. O

If O
you O
look O
at O
every O
poll O
who O
do O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
have O
more O
faith O
in O
in O
terms O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
? O

It O
's O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
. O

Who O
do O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
- O

Do O
they O
want O
to O
see O
a O
change O
in O
direction O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
? O

Absolutely O
. O

But O
Senator O
- O

And O
I O
think O
they O
respect O
the O
fact O
that O
Democrats B-NORP
do O
have O
divisions O
And O
are O
debating O
this O
And O
not O
just O
marching O
in O
lockstep O
to O
whatever O
the O
President O
does O
Because O
they O
're O
not O
happy O
with O
what O
the O
President O
is O
doing O
. O

This O
debate O
that O
Chuck B-PERSON
and O
I O
are O
having O
- O

And O
that O
's O
going O
to O
help O
us O
. O

This O
debate O
that O
Chuck B-PERSON
and O
I O
are O
having O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
big O
issue O
in O
the O
fall O
campaign O
. O

We O
're O
going O
to O
have O
this O
debate O
with O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
. O

Speaking O
of O

and O
rivalries O
Roll B-ORG

Welcome O
all O

Well O
first B-ORDINAL
the O
firestorm O
over O
leaks O
. O

uh O
For O
years B-DATE
the O
President O
and O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
have O
been O
trumpeting O
their O
success O
in O
following O
terror O
money O
. O

So O
Bill B-PERSON
Bennett I-PERSON
what O
is O
the O
harm O
in O
what O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
and O
other O
newspapers O
did O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
in O
publishing O
their O
stories O
? O

Well O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
who O
are O
saying O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
harm O
. O

Ask O
the O
Undersecretary O
of O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
Stuart B-PERSON
Levy I-PERSON
who O
is O
very O
upset O
about O
it O
. O

Ask O
the O
Secretary O
of O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
departing O
secretary O
Secretary O
Snow B-PERSON
. O

Ask O
Tom B-PERSON
Kean I-PERSON
and O
Lee B-PERSON
Hamilton I-PERSON
the O
co-chairmen O
of O
the B-ORG
Nine I-ORG
Eleven I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
. O

They O
're O
not O
exactly O
Bush B-PERSON
uh O
uh O
camp O
followers O
. O

Tom B-PERSON
Kean I-PERSON
said O
in O
an O
interview O
, O
he O
said O
, O
a O
very O
successful O
program O
which O
has O
been O
very O
successfu- O
successful O
successful O
in O
the O
war O
against O
terror O
has O
been O
lost O
compromised O
because O
of O
this O
. O

Well O
is O
n't O
it O
true O
that O
in O
fact O
this O
program O
was O
hinted O
at O
in O
the O
Nine B-ORG
Eleven I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
report O
? O

And O
both O
NBC B-ORG
analyst O
Roger B-PERSON
Cressey I-PERSON
who O
is O
a O
former O
national O
security O
official O
and O
his O
fellow O
former O
NSC B-ORG
officer O
Richard B-PERSON
Clarke I-PERSON
said O
that O
no O
harm O
was O
done O
. O

Let O
's O
look O
at O
what O
they O
wrote O
in O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
about O
this O
. O

Wildly O
overblown O
are O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
's O
protests O
that O
the O
press O
revelations O
about O
the O
financial O
monitoring O
program O
may O
tip O
off O
the O
terrorists O
. O

They O
want O
the O
public O
to O
believe O
that O
it O
had O
not O
already O
occurred O
to O
every O
terrorist O
on O
the O
planet O
that O
his O
telephone O
was O
probably O
monitored O
and O
his O
international O
bank O
transfers O
subject O
to O
scrutiny O
. O

How O
gullible O
does O
the O
administration O
take O
the O
adm- O
American B-NORP
citizenry O
to O
be O
? O

Bill B-PERSON
Safire I-PERSON
does O
the O
press O
have O
an O
obligation O
- O

Well O
- O

Is O
is O
that O
it O
? O

Is O
that O
it O
for O
me O
? O

No O
. O

Stand O
by O
. O

I O
want O
to O
ask O
Bill B-PERSON
Safire I-PERSON
to O
weigh O
in O
on O
this O
. O

Well O
here O
we O
are O
- O

Bill B-PERSON
Does O
the O
press O
have O
an O
obligation O
to O
print O
or O
not O
in O
this O
case O
? O

And O
were O
they O
giving O
away O
state O
secrets O
? O

Look O
uh O
I O
do O
n't O
speak O
for O
the O
Times B-ORG
. O

I O
've O
been O
in O
the O
Times B-ORG
for O
thirty B-DATE
years I-DATE
disagreeing O
with O
Times B-ORG
editorial O
policy O
right O
down O
the O
line O
. O

On O
this O
one O
I O
think O
they O
did O
the O
right O
thing O
. O

Here O
we O
are O
on O
Independence B-EVENT
Day I-EVENT
weekend O
Two B-DATE
hundred I-DATE
and I-DATE
thirty I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
celebrating O
what O
was O
the O
resistance O
to O
a O
king O
who O
said O
we O
're O
going O
to O
hang O
you O
for O
treason O
. O

And O
here O
we O
have O
a O
Long B-GPE
Island I-GPE
congressman O
happens O
to O
be O
named O
King B-PERSON
who O
's O
saying O
treason O
and O
put O
these O
reporters O
in O
jail O
. O

uh O
I O
think O
there O
's O
a O
big O
fundamental O
thing O
going O
on O
here O
now O
uh O
and O
an- O
uh O
across O
the O
board O
of O
get O
the O
press O
get O
the O
media O
. O

And O
uh O
look O
I O
used O
to O
write O
speeches O
for O
Spiro B-PERSON
Agnew I-PERSON
. O

uh O
uh O
uh O
I O
'm O
hip O
to O
this O
stuff O
. O

uh O
And O
uh O
and O
I O
can O
say O
that O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
blip O
. O

uh O
it O
gives O
you O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
on O
the O
offensive O
against O
the O
the O
darned O
media O
. O

But O
uh O
in O
the O
long O
view O
of O
history O
it O
's O
a O
big O
mistake O
. O

But O
is O
it O
the O
- O

This O
is O
what O
I O
do O
n't O
get O
. O

The O
people O
who O
killed O
three B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
Americans B-NORP
on O
September B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
who O
murdered O
Danny B-PERSON
Pearl I-PERSON
my O
colleague O
at O
The B-ORG
Wall I-ORG
Street I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
commit O
atrocities O
every O
day O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
are O
evil O
. O

But O
they O
're O
not O
stupid O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
understand O
the O
logic O
that O
says O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
they O
've O
discovered O
something O
they O
did O
n't O
know O
. O

September B-DATE

President O
Bush B-PERSON
walked O
into O
the B-FAC

We O
're O
putting O

financial O
institutions O

We O
'll O
work O

freeze O

uh O
We O

with O
the B-ORG
United I-ORG
Nations I-ORG
the O
EU B-ORG
the O
GB B-GPE
to O
follow O
this O
money O

But O
John B-PERSON
what O
Bill B-PERSON
Bennett I-PERSON
would O
say O
to O
you O
is O
that O
they O
did O
n't O
know O
about O
the O
so O
called O
@SWIFT B-ORG
program O
. O

How O
- O

They O
did O
n't O
know O
the O
specifics O
. O

Bill O
- O

Well O
where O
did O
the- O
-- O
where O
did O
we O
think O
that O
they O
think O
we O
're O
looking O
for O
money O
? O

Well O
why O
did O
they O
-- O
why O
did O
they O
get O
caught O
on O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
and I-DATE
three I-DATE
rather O
than O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
earlier I-DATE
when O
the O
program O
was O
announced O
? O

I O
know O
we O
have O
an O
air O
marshals O
program O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
which O
marshal O
is O
on O
which O
plane O
. O

Yeah O
we O
established O
a O
democracy O
. O

We O
we O
oppose O
a O
king O
. O

We O
have O
a O
president O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

. O

The O
founders O
let O
me O
go O
back O
two B-DATE
hundred I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

James B-PERSON
Wilson I-PERSON
said O
the O
press O
will O
be O
free O
. O

No O
prior O
restraint O
on O
the O

. O

However O
when O
they O
err O
, O
when O
they O
are O
irresponsible O
they O
should O
be O
held O
accountable O
. O

Now O
you O
put O
Richard B-PERSON
Clarke I-PERSON
up O
against O
Lee B-PERSON
Hamilton I-PERSON
and O
Tom B-PERSON
Kean I-PERSON
. O

I O
'm O
sorry O

Richard B-PERSON

known O

Tom B-PERSON
Kean I-PERSON
said O
a- O
the O
details O
of O
a O
valuable O
program O
were O
lost O
. O

Well O
he O
worked O
for O
a O
while O
in O
this O
administration O
. O

Lee B-PERSON
Hamilton I-PERSON
said O
the O
same O
thing O

Jack B-PERSON

these O
again O
are O
not O
cat O
's O
paws O
of O
this O
administration O
being O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
not O
to O
run O
this O
piece O
. O

You O
know O
Andrea B-PERSON
the O
administration O
every O
time O
there O
's O
a O
national O
security O
story O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
published O
they O
say O
it O
will O
damage O
national O
security O
. O

Yes O
Dana B-PERSON
? O

But O
they O
for O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
they O
've O
never O
given O
us O
any O
proof O
. O

They O
say O
it O
will O
stop O
cooperation O
. O

but O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
countries O
of O
the O
world O
understand O
that O
they O
have O
to O
cooperate O
on O
counter-terrorism O
. O

And O
just O
like O
the O
banks O
that O
did O
not O
pull O
out O
of O
the O
system O
other O
countries O
continue O
to O
cooperate O
. O

But O
Dana B-PERSON
- O

Have O
we O
heard O
that O
they O
're O
pulling O
out O
from O
this O
system O
? O

Because O
it O
's O
a O
common O
problem O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

Dana B-PERSON
let O
me O
point O
out O
that O
The B-ORG
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
your O
newspaper O
was O
behind O
the O
others O
but O
also O
did O
publish O
this O
story O
. O

And O
a O
story O
you O
wrote O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
disclosing O
the O
secret O
CIA B-ORG
prisons O
won O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Pulitzer I-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

But O
it O
also O
led O
to O
William B-PERSON
Bennett I-PERSON
sitting O
here O
saying O
that O
three B-CARDINAL
reporters O
who O
won O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Pulitzer I-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
you O
for O
that O
story O
and O
Jim B-PERSON
Risen I-PERSON
and O
others O
for O
another O
story O
were O
not O
worthy O
of O
an O
award O
but O
rather O
worthy O
of O
jail O
. O

Dana B-PERSON
how O
do O
you O
plead O
? O

Well O
um O
it O
's O
not O
a O
crime O
to O
publish O
classified O
information O
. O

And O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
things O
Mr. O
Bennett B-PERSON
keeps O
telling O
people O
that O
it O
is O
. O

But O
in O
fact O
there O
are O
some O
narrow O
categories O
of O
information O
you O
ca O
n't O
publish O
Certain O
signals O
communications O
intelligence O
the O
names O
of O
covert O
operatives O
and O
nuclear O
secrets O
. O

Now O
why O
is O
n't O
it O
a O
crime O
? O

I O
mean O
some O
people O
would O
like O
to O
make O
casino O
gambling O
a O
crime O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
a O
crime O
. O

Why O
is O
n't O
it O
not O
a O
crime O
? O

Because O
the O
framers O
of O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
wanted O
to O
protect O
the O
press O
so O
that O
they O
could O
perform O
a O
basic O
role O
in O
government O
oversight O
. O

And O
you O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
. O

Look O
at O
the O
criticism O
that O
the O
press O
got O
after O
Iraq B-GPE
that O
we O
did O
not O
do O
our O
job O
on O
WMD O
. O

And O
that O
was O
all O
in O
a O
classified O
arena O
. O

To O
do O
a O
better O
job O
and O
I O
believe O
that O
we O
would O
've O
done O
a O
better O
job O
we O
would O
've O
again O
found O
ourselves O
in O
the O
arena O
of O
- O

But O
we O
've O
now O
had O
a O
steady O
drum O
beat O
from O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
all O
week O
about O
this O
as O
you O
've O
pointed O
out O
. O

Here O
's O
what O
the O
President O
and O
the O
Vice O
President O
have O
been O
saying O
on O
the O
stump O
at O
campaign O
events O
. O

Last B-DATE
week I-DATE
the O
details O
of O
this O
program O
appeared O
in O
the O
press O
. O

There O
can O
be O
no O
excuse O
for O
anyone O
entrusted O
with O
vital O
intelligence O
to O
leak O
it O
. O
And O
no O
excuse O
for O
any O
newspaper O
to O
print O
it O
. O

The O
leaks O
to O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
and O
the O
publishing O
of O
those O
leaks O
is O
very O
damaging O
. O

What O
is O
doubly O
disturbing O
for O
me O
is O
that O
not O
only O
have O
they O
gone O
forward O
with O
these O
stories O
but O
they O
've O
been O
rewarded O
for O
it O
for O
example O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
terrorist O
surveillance O
program O
by O
being O
awarded O
the B-WORK_OF_ART
Pulitzer I-WORK_OF_ART
Prize I-WORK_OF_ART
for O
outstanding O
journalist O
. O

I O
think O
that O
is O
a O
uh O
disgrace O
. O

John B-PERSON
is O
this O
policy O
of O
trying O
to O
use O
the O
press O
as O
a O
whipping O
boy O
uh O
going O
to O
work O
to O
excite O
the O
conservative O
base O
and O
to O
turn O
voters O
out O
in O
the O
midterm O
elections O
? O

Well O
Republicans B-NORP
certainly O
think O
so O
. O

They O
if O
you O
're O
a O
Republican B-NORP
in O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
or O
in O
Congress B-ORG
would O
you O
rather O
talk O
about O
immigration O
gas O
prices O
the O
estate O
tax O
all O
the O
things O
that O
you O
ca O
n't O
get O
done O
right O
now O
. O

or O
would O
you O
rather O
go O
after O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
on O
the O
Guantanamo B-FAC
ruling O
we O
'll O
talk O
about O
that O
later O
and O
make O
hay O
and O
say O
They O
're O
tying O
our O
hands O
in O
the O
war O
on O
terrorism O
? O

It O
's O
obvious O
they O
'd O
rather O
do O
the O
latter O
. O

And O
they O
love O
this O
discussion O
. O

They O
're O
going O
to O
love O
it O
even O
more O
if O
Congress B-ORG
takes O
up O
uh O
legislation O
on O
Guantanamo B-FAC
. O

This O
is O
-- O
this O
is O
clearly O
no- O
not O
something O
new O
. O

Let O
me O
show O
you O
a O
tape O
from O
nineteen B-DATE
ninety I-DATE
two I-DATE
. O

Here O
's O
my O
favorite O
bumper O
sticker O
of O
all O
Annoy O
the O
medias O
, O
re-elect O
Bush B-PERSON
. O

And O
the O
Democrats B-NORP
of O
course O
also O
do O
this O
. O

This O
is O
how O
the B-ORG
Boston I-ORG
Globe I-ORG
covered O
a O
Howard B-PERSON
Dean I-PERSON
for O
president O
campaign O
rally O
back O
in O
two B-DATE
thousand I-DATE
four I-DATE
. O

Dean B-PERSON
told O
a O
crowd O
of O
supporters O
that O
his O
campaign O
was O
a O
struggle O
between O
us O
and O
the O
Washington B-ORG
politicians O
and O
the O
established O
press O
. O

Bill B-PERSON
Safire I-PERSON
what O
does O
this O
remind O
you O
of O
? O

It O
reminds O
me O
of O
a O
piece O
that O
I O
did O
back O
in O
the O
Carter B-PERSON
administration O
where O
I O
wrote O
that O
Billy B-PERSON
Carter I-PERSON
the O
President O
's O
brother O
was O
overheard O
talking O
many O
times O
with O
the B-ORG
Libyan I-ORG
Embassy I-ORG
. O

uh O
And O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
got O
very O
excited O
about O
that O
. O

Why O
? O

Because O
they O
said O
the O
Libyans B-NORP
did O
n't O
know O
that O
we O
had O
a O
tap O
in- O
on O
that O
-- O
eh O
on O
their O
embassy O
. O

Now O
that O
struck O
everybody O
in O
Washington B-GPE
as O
totally O
foolish O
Because O
for O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
fifty I-DATE
years I-DATE
every O
single O
embassy O
in O
this O
town O
is O
bugged O
. O

uh O
Now O
here O
here O
's O
the O
President O
say O
that O
who O
knew O
that O
the O
the O
details O
of O
this O
program O
? O

le- O
le- O
Let O
me O
refre- O
-- O
Now O
let O
me O
-- O
let O
me O
refresh O
all O
of O
our O
memories O
about O
something O
else O
that O
had O
happened O
. O

take O
a O
look O
at O
this O
piece O
of O
film O
. O

In O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
today O
we O
have O
more O
than O
our O
share O
of O
the O
nattering O
nabobs O
of O
negativism O
. O

Okay O
. O

Now O
whose O
alliterative O
phrase O
was O
nattering O
nabobs O
of O
negativism O
Mr. O
Safire B-PERSON
? O

Well O
uh O
Mr. O
Agnew B-PERSON
was O
kind O
enough O
to O
credit O
me O
with O
that O
afterwards O
uh O
because O
I O
'm O
an O
alliteration O
nut O
. O

This O
was O
when O
you O
were O
the O
speechwriter O
in O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
. O

uh O
Right O
. O

and O
uh O
I O
was O
on O
loan O
to O
uh O
Agnew B-PERSON
for O
that O
speech O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
write O
the O
Des B-GPE
Moines I-GPE
speech O
uh O
Pat B-PERSON
Buchanan I-PERSON
did O
that O
Where O
he O
really O
zapped O
the O
press O
. O

And O
again O
the O
uh O
the O
Nixon B-PERSON
administration O
in O
that O
case O
uh O
got O
a O
leg O
up O
. O

And O
people O
said O
Hey O
yeah O
we O
're O
angry O
at O
not O
just O
Nixon B-PERSON
. O

We O
're O
angry O
at O
the O
Congress B-ORG
. O

And O
we O
're O
angry O
at O
the O
media O
. O

Can O
may O
I O
-- O
can O
I O
-- O
can O
I O
- O

So O
the O
point O
is O
still O
-- O
the O
point O
is O
the O
tension O
between O
the O
media O
and O
the O
government O
is O
long O
- O
standing O
. O

And O
that O
's O
to O
be O
expected O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
all O
these O
many O
of O
the O
people O
getting O
up O
to O
lambaste O
the O
media O
now O
are O
also O
people O
that O
we O
talk O
to O
with O
our O
stories O
to O
vet O
our O
stories O
to O
say O
What O
is O
it O
in O
this O
story O
that O
you O
're O
most O
concerned O
about O
? O

You O
mean O
to O
hold O
things O
back O
? O

To O
hold O
things O
back O
. O

In O
the O
prison O
story O
we O
talked O
with O
the O
administration O
. O

No O
one O
in O
the O
administration O
asked O
us O
not O
to O
publish O
the O
story O
. O

In O
fact O
people O
said O
we O
know O
you O
have O
your O
job O
to O
do O
. O

but O
please O
do O
n't O
publish O
the O
names O
of O
the O
countries O
where O
the O
prisons O
are O
located O
. O

So O
there O
is O
a O
reasoned O
dialogue O
that O
often O
goes O
on O
between O
the O
media O
and O
the O
government O
behind O
behind O
all O
this O
. O

That O
was O
not O
the O
case O
with O
the O
NSA B-ORG
surveillance O
stories O
. O

That O
's O
correct O
. O

Can O
I O
-- O
can O
I O
say O
something O
Because O
I O
'm O
being O
quoted O
and O
talked O
about O
But O
I O
'm O
right O
here O
. O

You O
know O
I O
I O
'm O
right O
here O
. O

I O
can O
-- O
I O
can O
make O
my O
own O
case O
. O

Well O
please O
weigh O
in O
. O

Alright O
now O
you O
g- O
- O

uh O
Bennett B-PERSON
. O

You O
got O
-- O
you O
got O
three B-CARDINAL
people O
on O
one O
side O
. O

You O
got O
me O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

And O
let O
me O
just O
-- O
let O
me O
just O
state O
my O
position O
. O

It O
's O
not O
time O
to O
break O
out O
the O
champagne O
and O
the O
Pulitzers B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

This O
is O
not O
about O
politics O
Not O
from O
my O
perspective O
. O

It O
's O
about O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
and O
the O
security O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
of I-GPE
America I-GPE
. O

The O
difference O
is O
the O
government O
was O
elected O
. O

People O
may O
not O
like O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
. O

But O
they O
were O
elected O
. O

And O
they O
are O
entitled O
to O
due O
consideration O
on O
these O
matters O
. O

The O
American B-NORP
people O
in O
fact O
believe O
in O
a O
free O
press O
as O
I O
do O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
in O
prior O
restraint O
of O
the O
press O
. O

But O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
are O
saying O
if O
you O
listen O
to O
them O
in O
very O
very O
large O
and O
consistent O
numbers O
-- O
. O

And O
an O
awful O
lot O
of O
people O
across O
the O

are O
saying O
this O
is O
four B-CARDINAL
times O
now O
four B-CARDINAL

a O
very O

in O
nineteen B-DATE
eighty I-DATE
three I-DATE
where O
she O
said O
the O

went O
too O
far O
. O

It O
reported O
about O

between O
Syrian B-NORP

and O
their O
Iranian O
-- O
uh O
their O
Iranian B-NORP

the O

two B-CARDINAL

This O
can O

you O

Some O

some O
of O
the O

that O
some O
of O

that O

Let O
me O
respond O
to O
what O
Bill O
-- O
um O
the O
point O
he O
's O
making O
that O
who O
elected O
the O
media O
to O
determine O
what O
should O
be O
secret O
and O
what O
should O
not O
? O

Which O
is O
the O
fundamental O
point O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
the O
answer O
to O
that O
is O
the O
Founding O
Fathers O
did O
. O

uh O
They O
came O
up O
with O
this B-LAW
Bill I-LAW
of I-LAW
Rights I-LAW
beyond O
which O
uh O
the O
constitutional O
convention O
would O
not O
move O
unless O
there O
were O
a B-LAW
First I-LAW
Amendment I-LAW
to O
challenge O
the O
government O
just O
as O
the O
American B-NORP
Founding O
Fathers O
challenged O
the O
British B-NORP
government O
. O

Right O
. O

Now O
it O
's O
not O
treasonable O
It O
's O
not O
even O
wrong O
, O
for O
the O
press O
to O
say O
we O
're O
going O
to O
find O
out O
what O
we O
can O
. O

and O
we O
'll O
act O
as O
a O
check O
and O
balance O
on O
on O
the O
government O
. O

Sometimes O
we O
'll O
make O
mistakes O
. O

Sometimes O
the O
government O
will O
mistake O
. O

Is O
it O
wrong O
for O
the O
government O
to O
go O
after O
the O
press O
when O
the O
press O
has O
gone O
too O
far O
? O

Sometimes O
we O
-- O
sometimes O
even O
the O
uh O
Supreme B-ORG
Court I-ORG
admits O
to O
making O
mistakes O
. O

c- O
Can O
Should O
the O

if O
it O

No O

Let O
me O
agree O
with O
you O
for O
a O
moment O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
public O
opinion O
is O
much O
closer O
to O
Bennett B-PERSON
on O
this O
point O
than O
some O
of O
the O
other O
uh O
members O
of O
the O
press O
in O
the O
discussion O
. O

After O
Dana B-PERSON
wrote O
her O
story O
about O
secret O
prisons O
we O
asked O
in O
our O
Wall B-ORG
Street I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
NBC B-ORG
poll O
do O
you O
think O
the O
administration O
has O
gone O
too O
far O
in O
handling O
terror O

, O
or O
is O
it O
taking O
the O
right O
approach O
? O

Fifty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
to O
thirty B-CARDINAL
the O
American O
people O
said O
they O
've O
taken O
the O
right O
approach O
. O

But O
the O
press O
is O
never O
popular O
and O
most O
notably O
now O
. O

e- O
e- O
Exactly O
so O
. O

And O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
are O
not O
overly O
concerned O
at O
this O
moment O
about O
the O
finest O
points O
of O
civil O
liberties O
on O
this O
. O

Secondly B-ORDINAL
I O
accept O
that O
Bill B-PERSON
Bennett I-PERSON
is O
not O
motivated O
by O
politics O
in O
his O
views O
on O
this O
. O

However O
when O
you O
talk O
privately O
to O
Republicans B-NORP
on O
the O
Hill B-ORG
, O
why O
did O
we O
have O
a O
debate O
for O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
days I-DATE
on O
the O
Hill B-ORG
about O
this O
resolution O
that O
had O
no O
force O
of O
law O
whatsoever O
about O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
? O

They O
'll O
tell O
you O
it O
was O
politics O
. O

They O
love O
having O
this O
discussion O
. O

They O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O

Well O
we O
're O
still O
talking O
about O
basic O
right O
and O
wrong O
here O
. O

And O
i- O
is O
there O
any O
question O
that O
people O
- O

I O
think O
I O
'm O
the O
only O
one O
here O
who O
signed O
a O
nondisclosure O
agreement O
when O
I O
was O
-- O
when O
I O
was O
Director O
of O
National B-LAW
Drug I-LAW
Control I-LAW
Policy I-LAW
. O

Maybe O
some O
of O
you O
have O
. O

It O
's O
a O
pretty O
serious O
matter O
. O

People O
who O
signed O
those O
agreements O
in O
government O
have O
violated O
the O
law O
. O

they O
have O
violated O
their O
oath O
. O

They O
have O
done O
so O
by O
talking O
to O
Dana B-PERSON
Priest I-PERSON
talking O
to O
Risen B-PERSON
and O
talking O
to O
Lichtblau B-PERSON
. O

Let O
me O
let O
me O
- O

We O
need O
to O
get O
after O
those O
people O
. O

And O
one B-CARDINAL
way O
to O
get O
after O
those O
people O
is O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
reporters O
. O

Oh O
you O
're O
saying O
get O
after O
them O
. O

That O
means O
threatening O
reporters O
and O
threaten O
them O
with O
contempt O
and O
put O
them O
in O
jail O
. O

Bill O
what O
what O
let O
me O
ask O
Bill B-PERSON
- O

Absolutely O
absolutely O
. O

And O
that O
's O
wrong O
. O

Why O
is O
that O
wrong O
Bill B-PERSON
? O

Why O
are O
they O
above O
the O
law O
? O

Because O
it O
's O
a O
big O
step O
toward O
tyranny O
which O
is O
what O
we O
're O
supposed O
to O
be O
withholding O
. O

Because O
they O
're O
affected O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
a O
step O
toward O
tyranny O
. O

And O
what O
about O
the O
@AIPAC B-ORG
guys O
? O

Is O
that O
a O
step O
toward O
tyranny O
? O

They O
're O
being O

under O
the B-LAW
Espionage I-LAW
Act I-LAW

Bill O
Bill B-PERSON
Safire I-PERSON
let O
let O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
a O
question O
about O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
. O

Is O
n't O
that O
more O
a O
step O
toward O
tyranny O
? O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
who O
believe O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
in O
doing O
this O
latest O
story O
is O
motivated O
by O
an O
antibody O
animus O
. O

Is O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
making O
a O
decision O
that O
is O
political O
rather O
than O
editorial O
? O

The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
like O
The B-ORG
Wall I-ORG
Street I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
has O
a O
wall O
of O
separation O
between O
its O
editorial O
voice O
and O
its O
front O
page O
and O
its O
news O
coverage O
. O

And O
that O
's O
always O
been O
the O
case O
. O

Now O
does O
it O
uh O
always O
stay O
exactly O
the O
same O
? O

When O
you O
-- O
when O
you O
drive O
by O
down O
that O
road O
it O
is O
always O
right O
? O

No O
it O
changes O
. O

But O
in O
this O
case O
uh O
I O
am O
certain O
, O
I O
'm O
really O
certain O
, O
that O
the O
editorial O
position O
of O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
about O
the O
war O
which O
I O
completely O
disagree O
with O
did O
not O
affect O
its O
coverage O
of O
the O
-- O
of O
the O
news O
. O

Let O
me O
wa- O
-- O
let O
me O
show O
you O
a O
Wall B-ORG
Street I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
editorial O
very O
unusual O
editorial O
that O
was O
uh O
in O
the O
paper O
on O
Friday B-DATE
. O

it O
said O
that O
the O
problem O
with O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
is O
that O
millions O
of O
Americans B-NORP
no O
longer O
believe O
that O
its O
editors O
would O
make O
those O
calculations O
in O
anything O
close O
to O
good O
faith O
. O

We O
certainly O
do O
n't O
. O

On O
issue O
after O
issue O
it O
has O
become O
clear O
that O
The O
Times B-ORG
believes O
the O
US B-GPE
is O
not O
really O
at O
war O
. O

And O
in O
any O
case O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
lacks O
le- O
the O
legitimacy O
to O
wage O
it O
. O

John B-PERSON
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
really O
put O
you O
on O
the O
spot O
here O
. O

But O
I O
am O
. O

Your O
paper O
's O
news O
columns O
also O
ran O
this O
story O
. O

And O
here O
you O
have O
this O
editorial O
. O

uh O
It O
it O
really O
is O
uh O
a O
really O
sharp O
conflict O
. O

Couple O
of O
points O
on O
that O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
that O
editorial O
was O
n't O
kidding O
when O
they O
said O
there O
's O
a O
separation O
between O
the O
news O
and O
the O
editorial O
pages O
at O
The B-ORG
Wall I-ORG
Street I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
. O

That O
's O
for O
sure O
. O

Same O
with O
us O
. O

se- O
Secondly B-ORDINAL
there O
is O
a O
very O
large O
gap O
between O
the O
ideological O
outlook O
and O
philosophy O
of O
The O
New B-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
editorial O
page O
and O
The O
Wall B-ORG
Street I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
editorial O
page O
. O

There O
is O
not O
a O
large O
ideological O
gap O
between O
the O
news O
staffs O
of O
those O
two B-CARDINAL
places O
. O

And O
why O
would O
there O
be O
? O

Some O
of O
the O
top O
people O
of O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
were O
hired O
from O
The B-ORG
Wall I-ORG
Street I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
. O

What O
I O
found O
shocking O
about O
the O
editorial O
was O
the O
assertion O
that O
The B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
did O
not O
act O
in O
good O
faith O
in O
making O
that O
judgment O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
anybody O
on O
the O
news O
staff O
of O
The B-ORG
Wall I-ORG
Street I-ORG
Journal I-ORG
that O
believes O
that O
. O

I O
certainly O
do O
n't O
. O

Let O
's O
turn O
to O
Guantanamo B-FAC
and O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
. O

What O
is O
the O
political O
fallout O
John O
from O
the O
Guantanamo B-FAC
decision O
? O

is O
this O
something O
that O
can O
actually O
work O
in O
the O
administration O
's O
favor O
because O
it O
pits O
the O
Court B-ORG
according O
to O
the O
talk O
show O
hosts O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
days I-DATE
on O
the O
side O
of O
al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Qaeda I-ORG
? O

It O
's O
embarrassing O
uh O
internationally O
. O

It O
isolates O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

It O
's O
a O
setback O
for O
the O
administration O
's O
+philosophly O
philosophy O
. O

Politically O
I O
think O
they O
could O
come O
out O
ahead O
on O
this O
In O
part O
because O
as O
we O
just O
heard O
Mitch B-PERSON
McConnell I-PERSON
and O
Chuck B-PERSON
Schumer I-PERSON
say O
the O
US B-GPE
uh O
Congress B-ORG
is O
going O
to O
take O
up O
very O
soon O
legislation O
giving O
the O
President O
this O
authority O
. O

That O
's O
a O
good O
subject O
for O
Republicans B-NORP
to O
be O
on O
. O

Dana B-PERSON
what O
is O
it O
costing O
us O
diplomatically O
? O

Guantanamo B-FAC
. O

Huge O
. O

Which O
is O
-- O
which O
is O
the O
point O
not O
just O
on O
+Guantanamo O
Guantanamo B-FAC
But O
all O
of O
these O
programs O
. O

You O
know O
we O
are O
covering O
the O
war O
on O
terror O
. O

It O
's O
a O
classified O
war O
. O

How O
wha- O
why O
are O
we O
covering O
it O
? O

Because O
we O
want O
to O
figure O
out O
whether O
the O
government O
is O
going O
to O
achieve O
its O
strategic O
goals O
which O
is O
to O
defeat O
terrorism O
and O
to O
compete O
in O
the O
realm O
of O
ideology O
. O

It O
's O
not O
just O
the O
tactical O
question O
. O

And O
on O
Guantanamo B-FAC
this O
has O
cost O
us O
a O
lot O
internationally O
as O
a O
defender O
a O
primary O
defender O
of O
human O
rights O
. O

And O
you O
have O
to O
take O
those O
things O
into O
consideration O
when O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
win O
a O
war O
. O

Bill B-PERSON
Safire I-PERSON
should O
the O
administration O
take O
this O
as O
a O
cue O
to O
just O
shut O
Guantanamo B-FAC
or O
accept O
the O
John B-PERSON
McCain I-PERSON
approach O
now O
towards O
? O

No O
I O
think O
uh O
the O
administration O
should O
follow O
what O
the O
-- O
the O
guideline O
that O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
has O
suggested O
which O
is O
go O
to O
Congress B-ORG
and O
and O
get O
some O
kind O
of O
solid O
guidelines O
on O
what O
should O
happen O
. O

Wonderful O
thing O
here O
. O

Really O
a O
wonderful O
thing O
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

Here O
's O
a B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
which O
put O
George B-PERSON
W I-PERSON
Bush I-PERSON
in O
the O
presidency O
uh O
only O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
Now O
pulling O
him O
up O
short O
and O
saying O
hey O
you O
got O
to O
get O
some O
oversight O
. O

you O
got O
to O
get O
some O
congressional O
backing O
uh O
before O
you O
can O
do O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O

And O
as O
you O
just O
saw O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
program O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
senators O
who O
disagree O
about O
so O
much O
uh O
pretty O
much O
signaled O
you O
bet O
. O

we O
'll O
-- O
first O
we O
'll O
hear O
from O
the O
President O
. O

And O
he O
'll O
backtrack O
. O

And O
he O
'll O
say O
this O
is O
what O
kind O
of O
a O
military O
commission O
we O
need O
. O

And O
they O
'll O
keep O
Guantanamo B-FAC
. O

They O
'll O
keep O
uh O
the O
most O
dangerous O
terrorists O
there O
. O

And O
we O
'll O
have O
these O
military O
commissions O
. O

And O
uh O
they O
'll O
set O
a O
good O
pattern O
for O
the O
next O
president O
And O
hopefully O
not O
the O
next O
war O
. O

Andrea O
the O
other O
thing O
this O
does O
politically O
is O
underscore O
the O
arguments O
of O
conservatives O
of O
why O
it O
's O
important O
to O
change O
the O
Court B-ORG
. O

You O
had O
Scalia B-PERSON
Thomas B-PERSON
Alito B-PERSON
siding O
with O
the O
administration O
. O

and O
the O
administration O
was O
saying O
we O
need O
some O
more O
conservatives O
. O

The O
last O
word O
to O
you O
Bill B-PERSON
Bennett I-PERSON
. O

We O
only O
have O
about B-TIME
fifteen I-TIME
thirty I-TIME
seconds I-TIME
. O

Yeah O
I O
agree O
with O
Bill B-PERSON
Safire I-PERSON
. O

It O
's O
in O
uh O
in O
Congress B-ORG
's O
court O
now O
. O

And O
they O
need O
to O
act O
on O
it O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
Bill B-PERSON
Safire I-PERSON
that O
the O
press O
has O
a O
right O
not O
to O
give O
testimony O
in O
a O
criminal O
trial O
. O

They O
are O
not O
above O
the O
law O
. O

And O
when O
you O
show O

He O

no O

But O
if O

if O

killed O
as O
a O

So O
the O

whether O

are O
hurt O
by O
something O

I O
believe O

you O

that O

all O
those O

just O
hanging O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O

ever O

convince O
an O

Mr. O
Ellsberg B-PERSON
wise O
men O
made O
the O
point O
centuries O

that O
liberty O
without O

anarchy O

If O
every O

it O

what O

how O

That O
's O
a O
constant O
problem O

It O
can O
never O

They O
'll O

such O

their O

want O

I O
heard O
from O

, O
" O
the O

Hangzhou B-GPE

blast O

only O
14 B-DATE

it O

" O
reflects O
" O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
" O
of O
this O
Hangzhou B-GPE
government O
. O

It O
is O
unbelievable O
to O
see O
the O
report O
associate O
the O
blast O
demolition O
with O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
. O

The O
high O
riser O
has O
only O
been O
used O
for O
14 B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

What O
does O
it O
mean O
by O
14 B-DATE
years I-DATE
? O

If O
some O
messy O
buildings O
are O
left O
undecorated O
after O
six O
years O
of O
completion O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
not O
inappropriate O
at O
all O
to O
describe O
14 B-DATE
years I-DATE
as O
" O
brand O
new O
. O
" O

It O
took O
such O
a O
great O
fortune O
to O
build O
a O
high O
riser O
like O
this O
, O
and O
now O
it O
is O
blasted O
at O
an O
order O
. O

How O
wasteful O
it O
is O
in O
ordinary O
people O
's O
eyes O
. O

I O
will O
never O
ever O
believe O
everyone O
in O
Hangzhou B-GPE
has O
a O
place O
to O
live O
in O
without O
any O
impoverished O
households O
. O

If O
such O
a O
great O
fortune O
was O
from O
government O
appropriation O
, O
how O
many O
tax O
payers O
were O
needed O
? O

If O
it O
was O
invested O
by O
some O
business O
person O
, O
how O
many O
machines O
were O
needed O
to O
run O
and O
how O
many O
workers O
were O
needed O
to O
be O
busy O
? O

How O
many O
people O
can O
receive O
education O
and O
healthcare O
, O
among O
other O
things O
, O
with O
such O
a O
great O
fortune O
? O

What O
is O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
? O

The O
core O
is O
putting O
people O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

The O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
will O
never O
waste O
resources O
at O
will O
, O
or O
let O
people O
bleed O
and O
toil O
in O
vain O
. O

The O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
emphasizes O
a O
conservation O
- O
minded O
society O
. O

The O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
focuses O
on O
urban O
planning O
. O

Maybe O
some O
people O
say O
this O
tall O
building O
has O
ruined O
the O
West B-LOC
Lake I-LOC
views O
, O
and O
now O
we O
have O
attached O
importance O
to O
the O
scientific O
view O
of O
development O
. O

I O
would O
say O
please O
wait O
. O

If O
Hangzhou B-GPE
has O
only O
this O
one B-CARDINAL
" O
image O
project O
, O
" O
the O
blast O
of O
which O
could O
restore O
its O
original O
state O
, O
it O
can O
be O
barely O
regarded O
as O
" O
scientific O
development O
. O
" O

The O
problem O
is O
whether O
it O
will O
work O
? O

Hangzhou B-GPE
belongs O
to O
people O
of O
the O
entire O
nation O
. O

So O
many O
Chinese B-NORP
have O
been O
to O
Hangzhou B-GPE
. O

The B-FAC
Leifeng I-FAC
Tower I-FAC
was O
fallen O
down O
for B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
which O
also O
symbolized O
the O
emancipation O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
women O
, O
but O
later O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
was O
invested O
to O
build O
a O
fake O
tower O
standing O
beside O
the B-LOC
West I-LOC
Lake I-LOC
. O

A O
tour O
guide O
said O
: O
" O
people O
often O
went O
up O
to O
explore O
the O
relics O
before O
it O
was O
built O
, O
but O
they O
have O
become O
reluctant O
to O
go O
up O
after O
it O
was O
built O
. O
" O

Should O
we O

Even O

Thus O

the O

never O

If O

In O

I O
'm O
requiring O
a O

that O

Peace O

What O
I O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
in O
this O
topic O
is O
the O
increase O
in O
the O
price O
of O
everything O
without O
exception O
. O

Is O
it O
theft O
or O
is O
it O
a O
genuine O
increase O
which O
is O
subject O
to O
the O
circumstances O
that O
caused O
the O
increase O
? O

Everything O
has O
doubled O
in O
price O
and O
no O
one O
is O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
it O
. O

What O
's O
strange O
is O
that O
when O
I O
asked O
someone O
why O
the O
price O
of O
agricultural O
materials O
has O
increased O
when O
most O
of O
it O
is O
produced O
locally O
, O
he O
answered O
me O
, O
" O
Visit O
the O
wholesale O
center O
and O
you O
'll O
discover O
that O
those O
who O
are O
increasing O
the O
prices O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
" O
tapeworms O
" O
who O
raise O
the O
prices O
without O
anyone O
keeping O
an O
eye O
on O
them O
" O
. O

So O
where O
is O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Trade I-ORG
to O
give O
us O
the O
main O
reason O
for O
these O
increases O
in O
all O
goods O
? O

What O
is O
strange O
is O
that O
engine O
oil O
is O
priced O
but O
the O
real O
price O
is O
n't O
anything O
like O
it O
, O
I O
mean O
the O
company O
steals O
in O
broad O
daylight O
. O

One O
of O
the O
oil O
sellers O
told O
me O
that O
the O
posted O
price O
is O
just O
a O
suggested O
retail O
price O
and O
not O
the O
real O
price O
and O
that O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
in O
bulk O
to O
get O
the O
real O
price O
. O

So O
who O
is O
responsible O
for O
this O
? O

And O
how O
can O
any O
employee O
with O
a O
salary O
that O
's O
barely O
enough O
to O
live O
on O
cope O
with O
these O
unjustified O
increases O
? O

So O
who O
is O
responsible O
? O

By O
the O
way O
, O
in O
order O
to O
protect O
its O
citizens O
, O
a O
neighboring O
state O
announces O
the O
price O
of O
merchandise O
daily O
over O
the O
radio O
or O
by O
printing O
the O
prices O
in O
one O
of O
the O
newspapers O
. O

So O
what O
is O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Trade I-ORG
doing O
to O
protect O
us O
from O
traders O
? O


We O
begin O
with O
Strom B-PERSON
Thurmond I-PERSON
the O
man O
who O
set O

died O
last B-TIME

in O
his O

He O
won O
his O
first B-ORDINAL
election O
in O
1928 B-DATE
, O
the O
office O
of O
the O
county O
superintendent O
. O

From O
there O
, O
he O
had O
a O
36 B-DATE

career O
affiliated O
with O
the B-ORG
Democratic I-ORG
Party I-ORG
before O
he O
switched O
parties O
in O
1964 B-DATE
to O
support O
Barry B-PERSON
Goldwater I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
campaign O
for O
President O
. O

It O
started O
a O
36 B-DATE
- I-DATE
year I-DATE
career O
of O
the B-ORG
Republican I-ORG
Party I-ORG
. O

He O
gained O
national O
recognition O
as O
a O

. O

Much O
more O
ahead O
on O
his O
legendary O
and O
controversial O
career O
in O
just B-TIME
a I-TIME
few I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
. O

A O
man O
who O
had O
controversy O
, O
but O
knew O
how O
to O
change O
with O
the O
times O
. O


Federal B-ORG
Reserve I-ORG
critics O
used O
to O
complain O
of O
`` O
stop O
and O
go O
'' O
monetary O
policies O
. O

They O
claimed O
that O
the O
Fed B-ORG
would O
first B-ORDINAL
give O
a O
green O
light O
to O
the O
economy O
by O
making O
credit O
readily O
available O
and O
then O
turn O
on O
the O
red O
and O
bring O
growth O
to O
a O
screeching O
halt O
. O

But O
under O
Alan B-PERSON
Greenspan I-PERSON
that O
has O
changed O
. O

A O
supremely O
cautious O
man O
, O
the O
Fed B-ORG
chairman O
is O
forever O
blinking O
yellow O
. O

Indeed O
, O
his O
caution O
has O
become O
legendary O
within O
the O
government O
. O

He O
fusses O
endlessly O
over O
economic O
statistics O
, O
dissecting O
them O
in O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
ways O
, O
probing O
for O
hours B-TIME
in O
search O
of O
potential O
problems O
. O

After O
thoroughly O
digesting O
reams O
of O
information O
, O
he O
often O
concludes O
that O
more O
data O
are O
needed O
, O
and O
when O
he O
finally O
decides O
to O
act O
, O
his O
movements O
sometimes O
seem O
excrutiatingly O
small O
. O

Such O
caution O
was O
evident O
after O
the O
recent O
Friday B-DATE
- I-DATE
the I-DATE
- I-DATE
13th I-DATE
stock O
market O
plunge O
. O

Some O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
officials O
urged O
Mr. O
Greenspan B-PERSON
to O
make O
an O
immediate O
public O
announcement O
of O
his O
plans O
to O
provide O
ample O
credit O
to O
the O
markets O
. O

But O
he O
refused O
, O
claiming O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
see O
what O
happened O
Monday B-DATE
morning B-TIME
before O
making O
any O
public O
statement O
. O

Mr. O
Greenspan B-PERSON
's O
decision O
to O
keep O
quiet O
also O
prompted O
a O
near O
- O
mutiny O
within O
the O
Fed B-ORG
's O
ranks O
. O

A O
`` O
senior O
Fed B-ORG
official O
'' O
spoke O
on O
Saturday B-DATE
after O
the O
market O
swoon O
to O
both O
the B-ORG
Washington I-ORG
Post I-ORG
and O
the B-ORG
New I-ORG
York I-ORG
Times I-ORG
, O
saying O
the O
Fed B-ORG
was O
prepared O
to O
provide O
as O
much O
credit O
as O
the O
markets O
needed O
. O

The O
statement O
angered O
Chairman O
Greenspan B-PERSON
, O
but O
it O
was O
greeted O
with O
applause O
by O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
and O
the O
financial O
markets O
. O

And O
, O
while O
the O
mutinous O
Fed B-ORG
member O
has O
n't O
gone O
public O
, O
some O
Fed B-ORG
governors O
, O
most O
notably O
Vice O
Chairman O
Manuel B-PERSON
Johnson I-PERSON
, O
are O
known O
to O
have O
disagreed O
with O
the O
chairman O
's O
decision O
to O
remain O
silent O
. O

Ironically O
, O
the O
anonymous O
official O
's O
comments O
have O
earned O
some O
plaudits O
for O
Mr. O
Greenspan B-PERSON
, O
who O
is O
mistakenly O
seen O
as O
the O
source O
. O

At O
a O
hearing O
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
Democratic B-NORP
Sen. O
Chris B-PERSON
Dodd I-PERSON
of O
Connecticut B-GPE
told O
Treasury B-ORG
Secretary O
Nicholas B-PERSON
Brady I-PERSON
that O
`` O
Chairman O
Greenspan B-PERSON
's O
'' O
announcement O
over O
the B-DATE
Oct. I-DATE
13 I-DATE
weekend I-DATE
was O
a O
`` O
very O
important O
statement O
. O
'' O

Mr. O
Brady B-PERSON
hesitantly O
replied O
that O
he O
was O
n't O
sure O
whether O
Mr. O
Greenspan B-PERSON
`` O
made O
a O
statement O
himself O
, O
or O
whether O
that O
was O
a O
newspaper O
report O
. O
'' O

The O
Fed B-ORG
chairman O
's O
caution O
was O
apparent O
again O
on O
the O
Monday B-DATE
morning B-TIME
after O
the O
market O
's O
plunge O
, O
when O
the O
central O
bank O
took O
only O
modest O
steps O
to O
aid O
the O
markets O
. O

A O
surprisingly O
small O
amount O
of O
reserves O
was O
added O
to O
the O
banking O
system O
. O

And O
, O
by O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
that I-DATE
week I-DATE
, O
the O
key O
federal O
funds O
interest O
rate O
, O
which O
is O
largely O
controlled O
by O
the O
Fed B-ORG
, O
had O
settled O
at O
8.75 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
, O
barely O
changed O
from O
the O
level O
of O
just B-PERCENT
under I-PERCENT
9 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
that O
prevailed O
the B-DATE
previous I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

Bush B-PERSON
administration O
officials O
appear O
increasingly O
concerned O
that O
Mr. O
Greenspan B-PERSON
is O
cautious O
to O
a O
fault O
. O

Signs O
of O
growing O
weakness O
in O
the O
economy O
, O
paired O
with O
indications O
that O
inflation O
is O
staying O
well O
under O
control O
, O
have O
caused O
them O
to O
wonder O
why O
the O
Fed B-ORG
chairman O
is O
so O
grudging O
in O
reducing O
rates O
. O

Those O
concerns O
are O
n't O
expressed O
in O
public O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
administration O
and O
the O
Fed B-ORG
have O
been O
going O
out O
of O
their O
way O
in O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
to O
dispel O
any O
impression O
that O
they O
are O
at O
odds O
, O
fearing O
stories O
about O
an O
administration O
- O
Fed O
split O
added O
to O
the O
stock O
market O
's O
jitters O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
split O
is O
there O
. O

The O
administration O
's O
concerns O
are O
understandable O
. O

The O
economy O
is O
showing O
signs O
of O
weakness O
, O
particularly O
among O
manufacturers O
. O

Exports O
, O
which O
played O
a O
key O
role O
in O
fueling O
growth O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
seem O
to O
have O
stalled O
. O

Factory O
payrolls O
and O
production O
fell O
in O
September B-DATE
, O
and O
the O
auto O
industry O
and O
housing O
are O
in O
a O
severe O
crunch O
. O

But O
Mr. O
Greenspan B-PERSON
remains O
reluctant O
to O
loosen O
policy O
, O
partly O
because O
he O
faces O
a O
phalanx O
of O
presidents O
of O
regional O
Fed B-ORG
banks O
who O
oppose O
credit O
easing O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
chairman O
has O
a O
wary O
eye O
aimed O
a O
year B-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
down O
the O
road O
. O

Inflation O
may O
be O
stable O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
running O
at O
about B-PERCENT
4.5 I-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
. O

But O
if O
the O
Fed B-ORG
eases O
too O
soon O
, O
Mr. O
Greenspan B-PERSON
fears O
, O
prices O
may O
begin O
to O
accelerate O
again O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

Moreover O
, O
if O
the O
Fed B-ORG
holds O
tight O
, O
it O
may O
be O
able O
gradually O
to O
reduce O
inflation O
, O
moving O
toward O
the O
zero B-CARDINAL
- O
inflation O
goal O
that O
the O
Fed B-ORG
chairman O
embraced O
in O
testimony O
to O
Congress B-ORG
last B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

So O
far O
, O
Mr. O
Greenspan B-PERSON
's O
cautious O
approach O
to O
policy O
has O
served O
both O
him O
and O
the O
nation O
well O
. O

His O
hand O
on O
the O
monetary O
tiller O
seems O
one B-CARDINAL
reason O
why O
the O
economy O
next B-DATE
month I-DATE
seems O
highly O
likely O
to O
begin O
an B-DATE
unprecedented I-DATE
eighth I-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
peacetime O
growth O
without O
a O
recession O
. O

`` O
We O
've O
gotten O
through O
two B-CARDINAL
stock O
market O
crashes O
, O
and O
we O
've O
gone O
through O
an O
election O
without O
any O
major O
problems O
, O

David B-PERSON
Hale I-PERSON
, O
an O

`` O
I O
think O
you O
have O
to O
give O
Greenspan B-PERSON
a O
good O
rating O
. O
'' O

But O
such O
caution O
is O
no O
guarantee O
against O
mistakes O
. O

The O
Fed B-ORG
's O
reluctance O
to O
ease O
credit O
now O
could O
be O
laying O
the O
groundwork O
for O
a O
new O
recession O
, O
perhaps O
starting O
early B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

If O
that O
happens O
, O
Chairman O
Greenspan B-PERSON
could O
well O
become O
an O
open O
target O
. O

Already O
, O
Congress B-ORG
is O
toying O
with O
legislation O
to O
curb O
the O
Fed B-ORG
's O
independence O
. O

If O
the O
economy O
turns O
down O
, O
such O
proposals O
could O
gain O
strong O
momentum O

the O

the O

This O
long O

is O
all O

Using O

, O
when O

, O
Phillips B-ORG
Petroleum I-ORG

, O
like O

'' O

Phillips B-ORG

They O

Like O
the O

the O
yeast O
can O
take O

the O

Thus O
, O
the O

it O

just O
right O

We O
'd O
been O
praying O
for O

what O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O

We O
always O
thought O
we O
were O
going O

Denver B-GPE

live O
in O
my O
grandmother O

that O

about B-DATE
two I-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
one O
morning O
I O

think O
that O
we O

after O
praying O
that O
we O
were O
to O
move O
here O

she O
just O
had O
never O

that O
had O
a O
big O
backyard O
and O
apartments O
that O
we O
could O

Christian B-NORP
Indian B-NORP
lady O
in O
Omaha B-GPE
that O
I O

God O

an O
encouragement O
to O

Barry B-PERSON

real O

about B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
before O
we O

she O
called O
me O
at O

and O
she O
said O
she O
'd O
been O
praying O
all O
morning O
for O
us O

and O
she O
said O
Alison B-PERSON
she O
said O
I O
c- O
I O
just O
felt O
real O
strong O
I O
needed O
to O
call O
and O
tell O
you O
that O
that O
God O
's O
taking O
you O
to O
your O
promised O
land O

and O
she O
said O
%um O

see O
she O
does O
n't O
know O
my O
personal O
life O
you O
know O

we O
just O
share O

you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O

but O
she O
she O
does O
n't O
know O
like O
me O
personally O
you O
know O
everything O
about O

but O
it O
was O
amazing O
the O
insight O
she O
had O
into O
she O
said O
into O
us O

she O
said O
you O
know O
she O
said O
it O
just O
God O

me O
that O
you O

made O
the O
best O
out O
of O
Omaha B-GPE
and O
you O
were O
like O

did O
n't O
complain O
and O
kick O
and O
scream O
in O
the O
wilderness O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
so O
because O
you O
were O
trusted O
God O
and O
made O
the O
best O
of O
it O
he O
's O
taking O
you O
to O
your O
promised O
land O
quicker O
than O
if O
you O
'd O
complained O
the O
whole O
time O

and O
she O
just O
had O
this O
wonderful O

oh O
it O
just O
gave O
me O
chills O
all O
over O
. O

I O
started O
crying O
. O

oh O
. O

And O
and O
she O
said O
so O
you O
know O
just O
trust O
Him O
because O
he O
's O
taking O
you O
to O
where O
he O
wants O
you O
to O
be O
because O
you O
were O
faithful O
you O
know O
in O
Omaha B-GPE
and O
it O
was O
kind O
of O
like O
a O
wilderness O
. O

We O
did O
make O
the O
best O
of O
it O
you O
know O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
her O
insight O
was O
so O
perceptive O
. O

I O
started O
crying O
. O

I O
was O
like O
oh O
that O
's O
wonderful O
. O

And O
so O
then O

twelve B-DATE
months I-DATE
off O
work O

and O

Right O

maybe O
in O
twelve B-DATE
months I-DATE
just O
two B-CARDINAL
days O
a O
week O
or O
something O

but O
I O
really O
Right O
. O
did O
n't O
know O
about O
that O

and O
the O
day O
before O
I O
left O
work O
I O
got O
a O
phone O
call O
from O
the O
university O
here O
that O
I O
used O
to O
work O
at O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
they O
needed O
somebody O
as O
what O
they O
call O
a O
tutor O

oh O
. O

you O
have O
like O
a O
one B-TIME
hour I-TIME
session O
with O
the O
class O

and O
you O
just O
kind O
go O
over O
the O
lecture O
material O
with O
them O

My O

Right O
. O

and O
so O
and O
they O
needed O
somebody O
right O
away O

and O
it O
was O
actually O
starting O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
week O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
the O
baby O

so O
they O
gave O
me O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
off O

and O
then O
I O
've O
started O
doing O
that O

and O
it O
's O
only O
one B-CARDINAL
day O
a O
week O

and O
it O
's O
for O

like O
I O
have O
three B-CARDINAL
classes O

and O
then O
they O
pay O
me O
to O
mark O
all O
their O
exams O
and O
stuff O

so O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
make O
like O
in O
the B-DATE
fourteen I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
I O
'm O
doing O
that O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
make O
about O
%um O
oh O
it O
's O
nice O
a O
l- O
a B-MONEY
little I-MONEY
less I-MONEY
than I-MONEY
three I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY

so O
the O
Lord O
's O
really O
looked O
after O
me O
that O
way O

that O
will O
practically O
pay O
for O
my O
trip O
home O
my O
you O
know O
like O
my O
ticket O
and O
stuff O
. O

Right O
. O

oh O
that O
's O
wonderful O

so O
glad O

yeah O

it O
's O
great O
. O

And O
I O
finish O
right O
before O
I O
come O
home O

so O
that O
's O
really O
good O

and O
it O
's O
only O
like O
I O
only O
have O
to O
leave O
him O
at O
the O
babysitter O
for O
four B-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

That O
's O
fine O

a O

ti- O
a O
whole O

off O
a O

n't O
think O
they O

. O

No O

But O
since O

Congress B-ORG
learned O
during O
the O
Reagan B-PERSON
administration O
that O
it O
could O
intimidate O
the O
executive O
branch O
by O
uttering O
again O
and O
again O
the O
same O
seven B-CARDINAL
words O
: O
`` O
Provided O
, O
that O
no O
funds O
shall O
be O
spent O
... O
. O
'' O

This O
phrase O
once O
again O
is O
found O
throughout O
the O
many O
appropriations O
bills O
now O
moving O
through O
Congress B-ORG
. O

It O
signals O
Congress B-ORG
's O
attempt O
, O
under O
the O
pretext O
of O
guarding O
the O
public O
purse O
, O
to O
deny O
the O
president O
the O
funding O
necessary O
to O
execute O
certain O
of O
his O
duties O
and O
prerogatives O
specified O
in O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
Constitution I-LAW
. O

This O
species O
of O
congressional O
action O
is O
predicated O
on O
an O
interpretation O
of O
the O
appropriations O
clause O
that O
is O
erroneous O
and O
unconstitutional O
. O

The O
appropriations O
clause O
states O
that O
`` O
No O
Money O
shall O
be O
drawn O
from O
the O
Treasury B-ORG
, O
but O
in O
Consequence O
of O
Appropriations O

by O
Law O
... O
. O
'' O

The O
prevailing O
interpretation O
of O
the O
clause O
on O
Capitol B-ORG
Hill I-ORG
is O
that O
it O
gives O
Congress B-ORG
an O
omnipresent O
veto O
over O
every O
conceivable O
action O
of O
the O
president O
through O
the O
ability O
to O
withhold O
funding O
. O

This O
interpretation O
was O
officially O
endorsed O
by O
Congress B-ORG
in O
1987 B-DATE
in O
the O
Iran B-GPE
- O
Contra O
Report O

As O
partisans O
of O
congressional O
power O
understand O
, O
a O
`` O
power O
of O
the O
purse O
'' O
so O
broadly O
construed O
would O
emasculate O
the O
presidency O
and O
swallow O
the O
principle O
of O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

It O
is O
not O
supported O
by O
the O
text O
or O
history O
of O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
. O

The O
framers O
hardly O
discussed O
the O
appropriations O
clause O
at O
the B-EVENT
Constitutional I-EVENT
Convention I-EVENT
of I-EVENT
1787 I-EVENT
, O
according O
to O
Madison B-PERSON
's O
notes O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
they O
did O
, O
their O
concern O
was O
to O
ensure O
fiscal O
accountability O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
framers O
believed O
that O
the O
nation O
needed O
a O
unitary O
executive O
with O
the O
independence O
and O
resources O
to O
perform O
the O
executive O
functions O
that O
the B-ORG
Confederation I-ORG
Congress I-ORG
had O
performed O
poorly O
under O
the B-LAW
Articles I-LAW
of I-LAW
Confederation I-LAW
. O

It O
would O
contradict O
that O
objective O
if O
the O
appropriations O
clause O
-LRB- O
technically O
a O
limitation O
on O
legislative O
power O
-RRB- O
could O
be O
read O
as O
placing O
the O
president O
on O
Congress B-ORG
's O
short O
leash O
, O
making O
the O
executive O
consist O
of O
the O
president O
and O
every O
member O
of O
Congress B-ORG
. O

As O
it O
went O
to O
the O
conference O
panel O

deliberating O
, O
the O
appropriations O
bill O
for O
the O
executive O
office O
of O
the O

fiscal B-DATE
1990 I-DATE
contained O
some O
breathtaking O
attempts O

to O
rewrite O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
under O
the O
pretext O
of O
protecting O
the O
public O

During O
the B-DATE

, O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
must O
decide O
whether O
to O
veto O
the O

or O
, O
alternatively O
, O
to O
sign O
these O
bills O
into O
law O
with O
a O
statement O
declaring O
their O
intrusions O
on O
executive O
power O
to O
be O
in O
violation O
of O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
, O
and O
thus O
void O
and O
severable O
. O

The O
1990 B-DATE
appropriations O
legislation O
attempts O
to O
strip O
the O
president O
of O
his O
powers O
to O
make O
certain O
appointments O
as O
provided O
by O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
. O

Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
places O
on O
the O
president O
the O
duty O
to O
nominate O
, O
`` O
and O
by O
and O
with O
the O
Advice O
and O
Consent O

'' O
appoint O
, O
ambassadors O
, O
judges O
, O
and O
other O
officers O
of O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
. O

It O
also O
empowers O
the O
president O
to O
make O
recess O
appointments O
, O
without O
Senate B-ORG
approval O
: O
`` O
The O

by O
granting O

Session O
. O
'' O

Yet O
Section B-LAW
605 I-LAW
of O
the O
appropriations O
bill O
for O
the O
executive O
office O
provides O
: O
`` O
No O

'' O

Thus O
, O
with O
one O
brief O
passage O
in O
an O
appropriations O

Congress B-ORG
repeals O
the O

under O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW

Section B-LAW
605 I-LAW

the O
president O
's O
ability O
to O
nominate O
candidates O
of O
his O
choosing O
. O

The O
language O
of O
the O
appropriations O
rider O
implies O
that O
any O
nomination O
to O
any O
position O
of O
a O
rejected O
nominee O
will O
result O
in O
the O
president O
being O
denied O
funding O
to O
pay O
that O
person O
's O
salary O
. O

The O
president O
could O
probably O
not O
avoid O
this O
restriction O
by O
choosing O
people O
willing O
to O
serve O
without O
pay O
, O
because O
the B-LAW
Anti-Deficiency I-LAW
Act I-LAW
prohibits O
voluntary O
service O
to O
the O
government O
. O

The O
1990 B-DATE
appropriations O
bills O
also O
contain O
a O
number O
of O
`` O
muzzling O
'' O
provisions O
that O
violate O
the O
recommendation O
clause O
in O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
Constitution I-LAW
. O

Muzzling O
provisions O
, O
which O
might O
be O
called O
`` O
blindfold O
laws O
'' O
as O
well O
, O
prevent O
the O
executive O
branch O
from O
even O
looking O
at O
certain O
policy O
options O
, O
let O
alone O
from O
recommending O
them O
to O
Congress B-ORG
. O

Such O
laws O
violate O
the O
provision O
in O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
that O
requires O
the O
president O
to O
make O
recommendations O
to O
Congress B-ORG
, O
but O
which O
gives O
the O
president O
the O
discretion O
to O
select O
the O
subject O
matter O
of O
those O
recommendations O
. O

Typically O
, O
these O
laws O
seek O
to O
prevent O
executive O
branch O
officials O
from O
inquiring O
into O
whether O
certain O
federal O
programs O
make O
any O
economic O
sense O
or O
proposing O
more O
market O
- O
oriented O
alternatives O
to O
regulations O
. O

Probably O
the O
most O
egregious O
example O
is O
a O
proviso O
in O
the O
appropriations O
bill O
for O
the O
executive O
office O
that O
prevents O
the O
president O
's O
Office B-ORG
of I-ORG
Management I-ORG
and I-ORG
Budget I-ORG
from O
subjecting O
agricultural O
marketing O
orders O
to O
any O
cost O
- O
benefit O
scrutiny O
. O

There O
is O
something O
inherently O
suspect O
about O
Congress B-ORG
's O
prohibiting O
the O
executive O
from O
even O
studying O
whether O
public O
funds O
are O
being O
wasted O
in O
some O
favored O
program O
or O
other O
. O

Perhaps O
none O
of O
the O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
contained O
in O
the O
appropriations O
bills O
for O
fiscal B-DATE
1990 I-DATE
better O
illustrates O
Congress B-ORG
's O
attempt O
to O
usurp O
executive O
power O
than O
Section B-LAW
609 I-LAW
of O
the O
executive O
- O
office O
bill O
: O
`` O
None O
of O
the O

with O
the O

of O
the B-GPE

'' O

This O
provision O
amounts O
to O
a O
legislative O
veto O
over O
the O
president O

execution O
of O
the O
law O
, O
since O
a O
one B-CARDINAL

it O
would O

neither O
bicameral O
action O
in O
Congress B-ORG

presentation O
to O
the O

for O
his O
signature O
or O
veto O
. O

The B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
's I-ORG
decision O
in O
INS B-ORG
v. O
Chadha B-PERSON
held O
that O

President O

If O
President O

fails O
to O
do O
so O
in O
his O
first B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
he O
will O
invite O

, O
to O
rewrite O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW

to O
suit O
its O
purposes O
. O

What O
becomes O
custom O
in O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
will O
only O
become O
more O
difficult O
for O
future O
presidents O
, O
including O
Democrats B-NORP
, O
to O
undo O
. O

President O
Reagan B-PERSON
learned O
that O
lesson O
. O

By O
1987 B-DATE
, O
then O
- O
Speaker O
Jim B-PERSON
Wright I-PERSON
was O
discussing O
arms O
control O
in O
Moscow B-GPE
with O
Mikhail B-PERSON
Gorbachev I-PERSON
and O
then O
attempting O
to O
direct O
the O
president O
, O
through O
an O
appropriations O
rider O
, O
to O
treat O
the O
Soviets B-NORP
as O
though O
the O
Senate B-ORG
had O
ratified O
SALT B-LAW
II I-LAW
. O

If O
a O
veto O
is O
unworkable O
because O
it O
would O
leave O
part O
of O
the O
executive O
branch O
unfunded O
, O
the O
president O
could O
sign O
the O
appropriations O
bills O
into O
law O
and O
assert O
a O
power O
of O
excision O
, O
declaring O
the O
rider O
restricting O
his O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
powers O
to O
be O
unconstitutional O
and O
severable O
. O

The O
Constitution B-LAW
does O
not O
expressly O
give O
the O
president O
such O
power O
. O

However O
, O
the O
president O
does O
have O
a O
duty O
not O
to O
violate O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
. O

The O
question O
is O
whether O
his O
only O
means O
of O
defense O
is O
the O
veto O
. O

Excision O
of O
appropriations O
riders O
that O
trespass O
on O
the O
president O
's O
duties O
and O
prerogative O
under O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
would O
be O
different O
from O
the O
line O
- O
item O
veto O
. O

As O
discussed O
in O
the O
context O
of O
controlling O
federal O
spending O
, O
the O
line O
- O
item O
veto O
is O
characterized O
as O
a O
way O
for O
the O
president O
to O
excise O
perfectly O
constitutional O
provisions O
in O
a O
spending O
bill O
that O
are O
objectionable O
merely O
because O
they O
conflict O
with O
his O
policy O
objectives O
. O

The O
excision O
of O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
in O
an O
appropriations O
bill O
would O
be O
a O
power O
of O
far O
more O
limited O
applicability O
. O

One O
could O
argue O
that O
it O
is O
not O
an O
assertion O
of O
a O
item O
veto O
at O
all O
for O
the O
president O
, O
by O
exerting O
a O
power O
of O
excision O
, O
to O
resist O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
in O
legislation O
that O
violate O
the O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

There O
is O
no O
downside O
if O
the O
president O
asserts O
a O
right O
of O
excision O
over O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
in O
the O
fiscal B-DATE
1990 I-DATE
appropriations O
bills O

If O
Congress B-ORG

nothing O

the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
-LRB- O
assuming O
it O
can O
establish O
standing O
to O
sue O
-RRB- O
, O
President O
Bush B-PERSON
might O
win O
. O

In O
that O
case O
, O
he O
might O
receive O
an O
opinion O
from O
the O
court O
that O
is O
a O
vindication O
of O
the O

right O

the O

the O
framers O

If O

it O
might O

as O
Morrison B-PERSON

that O

`` O
We O

systems O
group O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Westinghouse B-ORG
hopes O
its O
venture O
with O
Mitsubishi B-ORG
will O
help O
fend O
off O
growing O
competition O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
, O
from O
such O
European B-NORP
competitors O
as O
Asea B-ORG
Brown I-ORG
Boveri I-ORG
AG I-ORG
, O
Siemens B-ORG
AG I-ORG
, O
and O
British B-ORG
General I-ORG

Under O
the O
agreement O
, O
Westinghouse B-ORG
will O
be O
able O
to O
purchase O
smaller O

its O
Japanese B-NORP

package O

sell O
them O

. O

Westinghouse B-ORG
also O
jointly O
will O
bid O
on O
projects O
with O
Misubishi B-ORG
, O
giving O
it O
an O
edge O
in O
developing O
Asian B-NORP

In O
addition O
, O
the O
two B-CARDINAL

, O
such O
as O
the O

and O
even O
utilize O

`` O
Even O
though O

Mitsubishi B-ORG
, O
we O
can O
also O
work O

on O
some O

and O
we O
'll O
gain O
a O
lot O
of O
sourcing O
flexibility O
, O
'' O
Mr. O
Stern B-PERSON
contends O
. O

The O
Westinghouse B-ORG
- O
Mitsubishi O
venture O
was O
designed O
as O
a O
non-equity O
transaction O
, O
circumventing O
any O
possible O
antitrust O
concerns O
. O

Westinghouse B-ORG
carefully O
crafted O
the O
agreement O
because O
the B-ORG
Justice I-ORG
Department I-ORG
earlier B-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
successfully O
challenged O
a O
proposed O
steam O
turbine O
joint O
venture O
with O
Asea B-ORG
Brown I-ORG
Boveri I-ORG
. O

It O
is O
expected O
that O
the O
current O
surge O
in O
demand O
for O
new O
power O
will O
be O
filled O
primarily O
by O
independent O
producers O
which O
, O
unlike O
utilities O
, O
are O
n't O
regulated O
and O
therefore O
do O
n't O
need O
government O
approval O
to O
construct O
new O
plants O
. O

Westinghouse B-ORG
expects O
about B-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
of O
its O
new O
orders O
for O
turbines O
to O
come O
from O
independent O
producers O
for O
at B-DATE

the I-DATE
next I-DATE
six I-DATE

. O

Despite O
shutdowns O
of O
the O
company O
's O
Lester B-GPE
and O
East B-GPE
Pittsburgh I-GPE
plants O
, O
the O
company O
believes O
it O
has O
sufficient O
capacity O
to O
meet O
near O

term O
demand O
with O
its O
much O
smaller O
and O
more O
efficient O
manufacturing O
facilities O
in O
North B-GPE
Carolina I-GPE
. O

Still O
, O
Westinghouse B-ORG
acknowledges O
that O
demand O
from O
independent O
producers O
could O
evaporate O
if O
prices O
for O
fuel O
such O
as O
natural O
gas O
or O
oil O
rise O
sharply O
or O
if O
utilities O
, O
which O
have O
been O
pressured O
by O
regulators O
to O
keep O
down O
rates O
, O
are O
suddenly O
freed O
to O
add O
significant O
generating O
capacity O
. O

Even O
if O
that O
scenario O
occurs O
, O
Westinghouse B-ORG
figures O
it O
is O
prepared O
. O

The O
company O
already O
is O
gearing O
up O
for O
a O
renaissance O
of O
nuclear O
power O

France B-GPE

fallen O
out O

each O

. O

They O
have O

Lastly O
, O
the O

of O
Rwanda B-GPE
announced O
that O
it O
was O
cutting O
off O
diplomatic O
relations O
with O
France B-GPE
entirely O
. O

The O
cause O
is O
said O
to O
be O
that O
a O
French B-NORP
judge O
issued O
an O
international O
warrant O
for O
the O
arrest O
of O
nine B-QUANTITY
important O
members O
of O
the O

government O
on O
the O
charge O
that O
they O
participated O
in O
the O
assassination O
of O
Rwanda B-GPE

former O
president O
twelve B-QUANTITY
years O
before O

The O
Rwandan B-NORP
government O
has O
resolutely O
denied O
the O
charge O
, O
while O
the O
international O
community O
has O
likewise O
not O
come O
to O
any O
conclusion O
regarding O
the O
affair O
. O

It O
is O
simply O
that O
the O
families O
of O
the O
French B-NORP
flight O
crew O
have O
brought O
the O
case O
to O
the O
court O
in O
France B-GPE
when O
the O
former O
president O
was O
killed O
and O
thus O
, O
that O
judge O
and O
the O
government O
want O
to O
hold O
their O
own O
law O
over O
the O
heads O
of O
others O
. O

If O
you O
put O
aside O
whether O
the O
evidence O
is O
conclusive O
and O
look O
only O
at O
the O
obstacles O
from O

law O
that O
the O

you O
will O
know O
that O
this O

Tuesday B-DATE
President O
Bush B-PERSON
is O
set O
to O
deliver O
a O
prime O
time O
televised O
address O
to O
the O
nation O
to O
try O
to O
explain O
US B-GPE
policy O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Polls O
show O
support O
for O
that O
policy O
down O
dramatically O
here O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

Just O
a O
short O
while O
ago O
I O
spoke O
with O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
military O
central O
command O
General O
John B-PERSON
Abizaid I-PERSON
about O
the O
challenges O
of O
battling O
a O
relentless O
in- O
in- O
insurgency O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
a O
lot O
more O
. O

General O
Abizaid B-PERSON
thanks O
for O
joining O
us O
. O

welcome O
to O
late B-WORK_OF_ART
edition I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Pleasure O
to O
be O
here O
. O

More O
suicide O
bombings O
and O
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
individuals O
killed O
. O

Once O
again O
people O
watching O
what O
's O
going O
on O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
have O
to O
ask O
is O
there O
an O
end O
to O
this O
? O

Clearly O
there O
is O
an O
end O
to O
this O
. O

That O
the O
end O
comes O
when O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
and O
Iraqi B-NORP
governance O
come O
together O
in O
such O
a O
way O
that O
they O
're O
able O
to O
dominate O
the O
insurgency O
. O

It O
it O
the O
end O
comes O
when O
the O
insurgency O
clearly O
understands O
and O
recognizes O
that O
that O
they O
ca O
n't O
achieve O
any O
progress O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
can O
achieve O
is O
killing O
innocent O
people O
. O

And O
so O
I O
I O
I O
am O
very O
uh O
clear O
in O
my O
understanding O
that O
we O
're O
moving O
in O
a O
good O
direction O
as O
long O
as O
politics O
moves O
forward O
and O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
moves O
forward O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
also O
very O
realistic O
in O
understanding O
that O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
violence O
ahead O
especially O
as O
we O
move O
through O
the O
political O
process O
and O
the O
insurgence O
will O
try O
to O
challenge O
the O
government O
and O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
and O
American B-NORP
forces O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
break O
our O
will O
and O
they O
do O
this O
by O
grabbing O
headlines O
. O

So O
what O
I O
-- O
what O
I O
hear O
you O
saying O
is O
that O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
military O
alone O
ca O
n't O
crush O
this O
insurgency O
. O

I O
I O
did O
n't O
say O
the O
United B-GPE
States I-GPE
military O
alone O
ca O
n't O
crush O
this O
insurgency O
. O

I O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
clear O
that O
crushing O
the O
insurgency O
has O
to O
do O
with O
a O
combination O
of O
politics O
economics O
military O
activity O
and O
diplomatic O
activity O
. O

Would O
it O
make O
any O
difference O
uh O
let O
me O
rephrase O
the O
question O
if O
the O
US B-GPE
had O
another O
hundred B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
troops O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
? O

What O
what O
we O
have O
to O
do O
is O
have O
the O
right O
number O
of O
troops O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

We O
have O
the O
right O
number O
of O
troops O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

We O
have O
to O
build O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
so O
they O
are O
capable O
of O
taking O
the O
lead O
in O
the O
counter-insurgency O
operation O
. O

The O
strategy O
really O
is O
pretty O
simple O
. O

and O
it O
's O
pretty O
elegant O
. O

and O
general O
Casey B-PERSON
has O
done O
a O
great O
job O
in O
developing O
it O
. O

We O
develop O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
. O

we O
continue O
to O
give O
them O
experience O
. O

we O
connect O
the O
chain O
of O
command O
. O

we O
build O
good O
leadership O
. O

and O
over O
time O
they O
take O
the O
lead O
in O
the O
counter-insurgency O
fight O
. O

The O
insurgents O
ca O
n't O
beat O
us O
. O

We O
we O
are O
very O
strong O
militarily O
. O

There O
there O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
notion O
out O
there O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
be O
pushed O
into O
the O
sea O
. O

That O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
any O
anything O
even O
close O
to O
what O
you O
might O
see O
. O

But O
I O
I O
I O
assume O
they O
think O
that O
if O
they O
keep O
this O
drum O
beat O
this O
deadly O
series O
of O
suicide O
bombings O
IED's O
improvised O
explosive O
devices O
, O
if O
they O
just O
keep O
killing O
a O
lot O
of O
individuals O
Americans B-NORP
and O
Iraqis B-NORP
, O
eventually O
the O
American B-NORP
public O
will O
get O
fed O
up O
and O
the O
US B-GPE
will O
pull O
out O
. O

Look O
. O

there O
's O
only B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
way O
for O
the O
insurgents O
to O
win O
. O

that O
's O
to O
drive O
us O
out O
before O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
are O
ready O
to O
assume O
the O
battle O
space O
. O

If O
that O
's O
what O
happens O
they O
could O
win O
. O

But O
but O
it O
's O
very O
very O
clear O
to O
me O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
stay O
the O
course O
, O
that O
we O
're O
going O
to O
build O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
capacity O
, O
that O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
are O
serious O
about O
being O
partners O
in O
this O
effort O
and O
they O
're O
very O
serious O
about O
taking O
over O
the O
effort O
. O

The O
insurgents O
ca O
n't O
win O
. O

The O
vice O
president O
Dick B-PERSON
Cheney I-PERSON
recently O
said O
that O
the O
insurgency O
is O
now O
in O
its O
last O
throes O
. O

I O
pressed O
him O
on O
that O
issue O
when O
I O
interviewed O
him O
earlier B-DATE
this I-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

Here O
was O
his O
response O
in O
part O
. O

If O
you O
look O
at O
what O
the O
dictionary O
says O
about O
throes O
it O
can O
still O
be O
a O
violent O
period O
the O
throes O
of O
a O
revolution O
. O

Is O
the O
insurgency O
right O
now O
in O
its O
last O
throes O
? O

The O
insurgency O
is O
in O
a O
no O
- O
win O
position O
. O

The O
insurgency O
can O
cause O
casualties O
. O

They O
can O
grab O
headlines O
. O

But O
as O
long O
as O
the O
politics O
move O
forward O
in O
a O
positive O
direction O
that O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
legitimate O
by O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
and O
as O
long O
as O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
continue O
to O
develop O
at O
the O
rate O
that O
they O
're O
developing O
and O
as O
long O
as O
American B-NORP
forces O
continue O
to O
stay O
there O
to O
provide O
the O
strength O
for O
those O
Iraqi B-NORP
forces O
as O
they O
develop O
we O
are O
after O
all O
the O
shield O
behind O
which O
politics O
takes O
place O
the O
insurgency O
wo O
n't O
make O
it O
. O

There O
's O
been O
discussion O
already O
as O
you O
well O
know O
of O
a O
quagmire O
emerging O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

Senator O
Kennedy B-PERSON
suggested O
there O
was O
a O
quagmire O
. O

the O
defense O
secretary O
Donald B-PERSON
Rumsfeld I-PERSON
insists O
there O
is O
no O
quagmire O
. O

listen O
to O
this O
exchange O
that O
they O
had O
. O

We O
are O
in O
serious O
trouble O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
this O
war O
has O
been O
consistently O
and O
grossly O
mismanaged O
. O

And O
we O
are O
now O
in O
a O
seemingly O
intractable O
quagmire O
. O

Our O
troops O
are O
dying O
. O

And O
there O
really O
is O
no O
end O
in O
sight O
. O

There O
is O
n't O
a O
person O
at O
this O
table O
who O
agrees O
with O
you O
that O
we O
're O
in O
a O
quagmire O
and O
that O
there O
's O
no O
end O
in O
sight O
. O

Give O
us O
your O
assessment O
. O

It O
's O
very O
interesting O
that O
we O
testified O
on O
Capital B-LOC
Hill I-LOC
for O
about B-TIME
nine I-TIME
hours I-TIME
and O
we O
take O
the O
nine B-TIME
second I-TIME
sound O
bites O
out O
that O
seem O
to O
get O
the O
most O
headlines O
. O

But O
our O
message O
was O
pretty O
clear O
across O
the O
board O
. O

We O
're O
making O
progress O
. O

The O
insurgents O
ca O
n't O
win O
. O

We O
're O
the O
shield O
behind O
which O
politics O
and O
the O
develop O
of O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
will O
take O
place O
and O
eventually O
be O
decisive O
in O
that O
we O
're O
in O
a O
partnership O
with O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
. O

People O
seem O
to O
think O
we O
're O
fighting O
against O
Iraqis B-NORP
. O

Well O
there O
are O
some O
small O
number O
of O
insurgents O
that O
we O
're O
fighting O
against O
. O

But O
we O
're O
fighting O
with O
a O
lot O
more O
Iraqis B-NORP
day O
by O
day O
. O

And O
they O
're O
giving O
their O
lives O
in O
the O
defense O
of O
their O
country O
. O

This O
is O
not O
a O
quagmire O
. O

it O
is O
a O
marathon O
. O

and O
we O
're O
at O
about O
the O
twenty B-ORDINAL
- I-ORDINAL
first I-ORDINAL
mile O
. O

and O
we O
just O
need O
to O
not O
hit O
the O
wall O
. O

We O
need O
to O
get O
through O
till O
the O
end O
. O

How O
many O
insurgents O
are O
there O
? O

During O
the O
testimony O
y- O
y- O
you O
heard O
that O
the O
maximum O
number O
was O
about B-CARDINAL
twenty I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
. O

George B-PERSON
Casey I-PERSON
said O
one B-PERCENT
- I-PERCENT
tenth I-PERCENT
of I-PERCENT
one I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O

But O
you O
got O
to O
understand O
there O
were O
committed O
people O
. O

There O
are O
people O
that O
support O
the O
insurgency O
. O

When O
politics O
move O
in O
different O
directions O
the O
numbers O
go O
up O
. O

they O
go O
down O
. O

uh O
but O
there O
's O
probably O
about B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
foreign O
fighters O
and O
about O
somewhere B-CARDINAL
less I-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
ten I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
committed O
insurgents O
in O
the O
field O
most O
of O
which O
are O
in O
the O
uh O
mostly O
western O
western O
part O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
area O
and O
uh O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
in O
Baghdad B-GPE
. O

They O
ca O
n't O
beat O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
. O

They O
can O
cause O
casualties O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
really O
go O
after O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
. O

they O
go O
after O
civilians O
. O

I O
mean O
this O
is O
the O
most O
cynical O
strategy O
I O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

They O
ca O
n't O
be O
successful O
. O

they O
ca O
n't O
win O
. O

The O
uh O
ranking O
democrat B-NORP
on O
the O
senate O
foreign O
relations O
committee O
Joe B-PERSON
Biden I-PERSON
was O
just O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

He O
came O
back O
gave O
a O
speech O
in O
Washington B-GPE
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

He O
said O
of O
the O
hundred B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
so I-CARDINAL
Iraqi B-NORP
battalions O
that O
you O
're O
training O
only O
three B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
right O
now O
are O
fully O
capable O
of O
going O
out O
and O
are O
battle O
tested O
and O
battle O
ready O
. O

is O
that O
true O
? O

Well O
he O
was O
shown O
a O
chart O
. O

And O
and O
you O
can O
always O
look O
at O
a O
chart O
differently O
. O

And O
the O
chart O
said O
that O
three B-CARDINAL
battalions O
were O
theoretically O
independent O
capable O
of O
independent O
operations O
. O

That O
that O
's O
not O
really O
a O
good O
description O
of O
what O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
armed O
forces O
are O
doing O
. O

Up O
in O
the O
North B-LOC
there O
's O
two B-CARDINAL
divisions O
that O
are O
fighting O
in O
the O
area O
. O

there O
's O
a O
division O
that O
are O
fighting O
-- O
that O
is O
fighting O
down O
in O
the O
Baghdad B-GPE
area O
. O

They O
there O
is O
a O
growing O
capability O
of O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
security O
forces O
to O
be O
more O
and O
more O
effective O
against O
the O
insurgency O
. O

and O
we O
should O
not O
underestimate O
their O
improvement O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
they O
're O
not O
ready O
to O
stand O
alone O
yet O
. O

but O
they O
will O
be O
. O

Just O
ahead O
more O
of O
my O
conversation O
with O
General O
Abizaid B-PERSON

the O
morale O

in O
Iraq B-GPE

Welcome O

Late B-WORK_OF_ART

We O
return O
now O
to O
my O
interview O
with O
the O
commander O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
military O
central O
command O
general O
John B-PERSON
Abizaid I-PERSON
. O

Here O
's O
what O
the O
economist O
magazine O
wrote O
about O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
military O
in O
the O
June B-DATE
twentieth I-DATE
issue O
. O

Corrupt O
patchily O
trained O
and O
equipped O
often O
abysmally O
led O
and O
devoid O
of O
confidence O
. O

Most O
army O
units O
can O
not O
operate O
above O
platoon O
size O
. O

Between O
Iraqis B-NORP
and O
Americans B-NORP
there O
is O
deep O
mistrust O
. O

Iraqi B-NORP
units O
billeted O
on O
an O
American B-NORP
bases O
are O
fenced O
off O
from O
their O
host O
as O
a O
security O
measure O
. O

The O
partnership O
that O
exists O
between O
Iraqi B-NORP
units O
and O
American B-NORP
units O
is O
certainly O
mu- O
much O
stronger O
and O
much O
more O
robust O
than O
than O
that O
article O
would O
uh O
would O
indicate O
. O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
what O
that O
says O
. O

I O
think O
there O
is O
a O
good O
partnership O
. O

There O
is O
good O
coordination O
in O
the O
field O
. O

And O
more O
Iraqis B-NORP
are O
dying O
on O
the O
battle O
field O
fighting O
for O
their O
country O
against O
the O
insurgency O
than O
Americans B-NORP
. O

It O
's O
a O
point O
we O
've O
got O
to O
understand O
. O

We O
have O
to O
respect O
them O
for O
fighting O
the O
way O
that O
they O
're O
fighting O
. O

Just O
look O
at O
how O
things O
were O
in O
the O
American B-NORP
army O
in O
seventeen B-DATE
seventy I-DATE
five I-DATE
seventeen B-DATE
seventy I-DATE
six I-DATE
as O
we O
think O
about O
the O
fourth B-DATE
of I-DATE
July I-DATE
holiday O
ahead O
of O
us O
. O

We O
we O
had O
a O
terrible O
time O
getting O
our O
act O
together O
to O
win O
against O
the O

ultimately O
we O

And O
that O
's O
what O
's O
going O
to O
happen O
with O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
armed O

well O

The B-ORG
Sunday I-ORG
Times I-ORG
of I-ORG
London I-ORG
has O
a O
piece O
today B-DATE
suggesting O
that O
there O
has O
emerged O
a O
dialog O
of O
discussions O
between O
US B-GPE
officials O
and O
Iraqi B-NORP
insurgents O
. O

is O
that O
true O
? O

I O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
I O
would O
characterize O
it O
as O
a O
dialog O
between O
US B-GPE
officials O
and O
insurgents O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
US B-GPE
officials O
and O
Iraqi B-NORP
officials O
are O
looking O
for O
the O
right O
people O
in O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
community O
to O
talk O
to O
in O
order O
to O
insure O
that O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
Arab I-NORP
community O
becomes O
part O
of O
the O
political O
process O
. O

And O
clearly O
we O
know O
that O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
insurgents O
are O
from O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
Arab I-NORP
community O
. O

It O
makes O
sense O
to O
talk O
to O
them O
. O

We O
we O
're O
not O
going O
to O
compromise O
with O
Zarqawi B-PERSON
. O

Uh O
we O
will O
look O
for O
opportunities O
to O
find O
out O
how O
to O
bring O
the O
Sunni B-NORP
Arab I-NORP
community O
into O
the O
political O
fold O
. O

and O
when O
we O
do O
that O
and O
they O
participate O
in O
a O
peaceful O
way O
I O
think O
Iraq B-GPE
will O
really O
start O
moving O
in O
a O
positive O
direction O
. O

I O
I O
I O
sense O
that O
Abu B-PERSON
Musab I-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Zarqawi I-PERSON
terrorist O
number B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
in O
Iraq B-GPE
still O
on O
the O
loose O
right O
now O
. O

but O
is O
he O
- O

do O
you O
have O
any O
idea O
where O
he O
is O
? O

We O
we O
certainly O
have O
some O
ideas O
where O
he O
operates O
. O

we O
know O
where O
his O
networks O
are O
. O

we O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
pressure O
on O
his O
networks O
. O

We O
've O
been O
pretty O
successful O
here O
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
several I-DATE
months I-DATE
working O
against O
his O
networks O
. O

it O
's O
only O
a O
matter O
of O
time O
for O
Zarqawi B-PERSON
. O

Can O
you O
give O
us O
a O
sense O
of O
where O
he O
might O
be O
the O
north O
the O
south O
the O
east O
the O
west O
? O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
ever O
serves O
any O
purpose O
when O
a O
military O
commander O
tells O
the O
international O
world O
the O
internal O
community O
where O
a O
particular O
enemy O
might O
be O
. O

I O
I O
think O
uh O
we O
have O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

we O
know O
what O
we O
're O
doing O
in O
our O
efforts O
, O
how O
to O
get O
him O
. O

I O
want O
to O
also O
stress O
that O
it O
's O
not O
about O
one B-CARDINAL
man O
, O
it O
's O
about O
his O
network O
. O

His O
network O
exists O
inside O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

It O
's O
connected O
to O
Al O
- O
Queda O
. O

It O
's O
got O
facilitation O
nodes O
in O
Syria B-GPE
. O

It O
brings O
foreign O
fighters O
in O
from O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
and O
North B-LOC
Africa I-LOC
. O

It O
is O
connected O
to O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Afghanistan B-GPE
and O
what O
is O
happening O
in O
Pakistan B-GPE
. O

It O
is O
a O
global O
battle O
that O
we O
face O
. O

The O
Zarqawi B-PERSON
part O
of O
the O
network O
needs O
to O
be O
taken O
down O
. O

He O
needs O
to O
be O
captured O
or O
killed O
. O

But O
we O
we O
should O
understand O
it O
's O
a O
long O
war O
ahead O
of O
us O
. O

It O
's O
a O
difficult O
enemy O
that O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
fight O
over O
time O
throughout O
the O
region O
. O

Do O
you O
agree O
with O
the O
CIA B-ORG
assessment O
and O
a O
recent O
assessment O
that O
the O
terrorist O
training O
ground O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
today B-DATE
effectively O
has O
become O
a O
more O
effective O
training O
ground O
for O
Al O
- O
Queda O
and O
for O
international O
terrorists O
than O
Afghanistan B-GPE
under O
the O
Taliban B-ORG
ever O
was O
? O

No O
I O
I O
I O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
it O
. O

The O
terrorist O
are O
going O
to O
train O
organize O
operate O
and O
strike O
wherever O
they O
can O
find O
a O
safe O
haven O
. O

They O
they O
are O
certainly O
fighting O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

I O
I O
would O
tell O
you O
if O
you O
're O
a O
young O
Saudi B-NORP
that O
decides O
to O
volunteer O
for O
the O
Jihad O
and O
you O
come O
into O
Iraq B-GPE
the O
chances O
are O
extremely O
good O
that O
you O
'll O
never O
come O
back O
from O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

And O
so O
the O
mortality O
rate O
for O
foreign O
fighters O
is O
really O
phenomenal O
. O

The O
the O
place O
where O
terrorism O
really O
can O
get O
established O
is O
in O
places O
that O
are O
ungoverned O
spaces O
that O
are O
like O
between O
the O
Afghanistan B-GPE
Pakistan B-GPE
border O
area O
in O
the O
horn O
of O
Africa B-LOC
down O
in O
parts O
of O
the O
Arabian B-NORP
principle O
. O

and O
we O
should O
not O
kid O
ourselves O
that O
Iraq B-GPE
somehow O
or O
other O
has O
made O
a O
difference O
. O

Iraq B-GPE
is O
part O
of O
the O
battle O
. O

It O
's O
central O
in O
the O
battle O
. O

Uh O
but O
it O
's O
not O
the O
only O
battle O
. O

Is O
it O
time O
to O
reconsider O
women O
American B-NORP
women O
in O
combat O
in O
the O
aftermath O
of O
what O
happened O
this B-DATE
past I-DATE
week I-DATE
? O

More O
American B-NORP
women O
died O
in O
combat O
were O
injured O
I O
believe O
in O
any O
time O
since O
World B-EVENT
War I-EVENT
Two I-EVENT
. O

No O
it O
's O
not O
time O
to O
reconsider O
. O

You O
you O
're O
happy O
with O
the O
rules O
that O
exist O
right O
now O
as O
far O
as O
women O
are O
concerned O
? O

Ou- O
our O
armed O
forces O
are O
better O
than O
they O
've O
ever O
been O
. O

They O
're O
made O
up O
the O
way O
they O
are O
. O

That O
's O
how O
we O
fight O
. O

That O
's O
how O
we O
do O
our O
business O
. O

We O
need O
to O
keep O
them O
the O
way O
they O
are O
. O

And O
we O
're O
being O
quite O
successful O
. O

The O
CIA B-ORG
director O
Porter B-PERSON
Goss I-PERSON
recently O
said O
he O
has O
an O
excellent O
idea O
where O
Osama B-PERSON
Bin I-PERSON
Laden I-PERSON
is O
. O

do O
you O
? O

We O
have O
a O
clear O
understanding O
of O
where O
the O
Al O
- O
Queda O
senior O
leadership O
operates O
in O
a O
very O
very O
large O
geographic O
area O
between O
areas O
of O
the O
Afghan B-NORP
and O
Pakistani B-NORP
border O
area O
. O

and O
I O
would O
say O
that O
's O
about O
the O
best O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
do O
in O
answering O
that O
question O
. O

I O
heard O
your O
testimony O
this O
week O
before O
the O
House B-ORG
and O
the O
Senate B-ORG
. O

and O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
play O
for O
you O
what O
I O
thought O
may O
have O
been O
the O
most O
alarming O
words O
I O
heard O
from O
you O
. O

Listen O
to O
this O
. O

When O
my O
soldiers O
say O
to O
me O
and O
ask O
me O
the O
question O
whether O
or O
not O
they O
've O
got O
support O
from O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
or O
not O
that O
worries O
me O
. O

and O
they O
're O
starting O
to O
do O
that O
. O

What O
did O
you O
mean O
by O
that O
? O

We O
we O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
fight O
this O
war O
looking O
over O
our O
shoulder O
worrying O
about O
support O
back O
home O
. O

We O
need O
to O
know O
we O
've O
got O
support O
back O
home O
. O

American B-NORP
soldiers O
fight O
best O
when O
they O
know O
the O
people O
back O
home O
are O
behind O
them O
. O

We O
are O
fighting O
for O
all O
the O
right O
reasons O
against O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
despicable O
and O
dangerous O
enemies O
this O
nation O
has O
ever O
faced O
. O

We O
need O
to O
know O
that O
the O
people O
are O
with O
us O
. O

I O
think O
the O
American B-NORP
public O
strongly O
supports O
the O
troops O
. O

what O
they O
're O
concerned O
about O
is O
the O
war O
. O

The O
most O
recent O
CNN B-ORG
USA B-ORG
Today I-ORG
Gallup B-ORG
poll O
uh O
showed O
that O
the O
numbers O
have O
gone O
down O
to O
thirty B-PERCENT
nine I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
favor O
the O
war O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
compared O
to O
seventy B-PERCENT
one I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
shortly O
after O
major O
combat O
operations O
were O
over O
. O

That O
's O
a O
disturbing O
element O
I O
assume O
for O
you O
as O
far O
as O
the O
demoralization O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
military O
. O

That O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
Wolf B-PERSON
is O
when O
I O
go O
to O
the O
field O
the O
soldiers O
are O
uniformly O
confident O
about O
their O
ability O
to O
face O
this O
enemy O
make O
Iraq B-GPE
Afghanistan B-GPE
whatever O
area O
they O
happen O
to O
be O
operating O
in O
better O
defeat O
the O
terrorist O
wherever O
they O
find O
them O
and O
they O
all O
understand O
it O
's O
going O
to O
take O
time O
. O

It O
it O
it O
's O
not O
a O
sprint O
. O

it O
's O
a O
marathon O
. O

We O
need O
people O
to O
understand O
it O
will O
take O
time O
but O
that O
ultimately O
we O
will O
prevail O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
final O
question O
. O

now O
you O
're O
command O
of O
central O
command O
has O
the O
whole O
middle B-LOC
east I-LOC
. O

uh O
the O
new O
president O
elected O
of O
Iran B-GPE
he O
's O
considered O
a O
hard O
liner O
. O

what O
if O
anything O
from O
the O
military O
's O
perspective O
does O
this O
mean O
for O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
? O

I O
I O
'm O
really O
not O
in O
the O
position O
to O
be O
able O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
new O
newly O
elected O
president O
. O

I O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
much O
about O
him O
. O

Iran B-GPE
's O
an O
important O
player O
in O
the O
overall O
scheme O
of O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
. O

We O
need O
to O
have O
them O
working O
towards O
stability O
in O
both O
Afghanistan B-GPE
and O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

and O
we O
're O
hopeful O
that O
under O
the O
new O
leadership O
that O
they O
'll O
continue O
to O
do O
that O
. O

Thanks O
very O
much O
General O
for O
joining O
us O
. O

good O
luck O
. O

If O
I O
could O
just O
say O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
on O
this B-DATE
fourth I-DATE
of I-DATE
July I-DATE
weekend I-DATE
, O
if O
you O
would O
n't O
mind O
me O
saying O
it O
. O
I O
would O
really O
just O
ask O
people O
as O
they O
're O
gathered O
with O
friends O
and O
families O
to O
remember O
our O
young O
men O
and O
women O
overseas O
fighting O
. O

Uh O
our O
young O
people O
are O
doing O
a O
great O
job O
. O

they O
're O
really O
the O
finest O
generation O
we O
've O
ever O
put O
in O
the O
field O
. O

And O
I O
can O
-- O
uh O
I O
can O
testify O
to O
that O
. O

I O
was O
with O
you O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
couple I-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
in O
the O

and O
I O
saw O
first B-ORDINAL

what O
they O
're O

Appreciate O
it O

Thanks O
Wolf B-PERSON

we O
'll O
get O
a O
quick O
check O
of O
what O
's O
in O

right O

Then O
is O
it O
time O
for O

Great O
to O
be O
with O
you O
Wolf B-PERSON
. O

You O
just O
heard O
General O
Abizaid B-PERSON
say O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
military O
is O
now O
at O
what O
he O
said O
mile O
twenty B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
in O
a O
marathon O
. O

As O
far O
as O
dealing O
with O
the O
insurgency O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
there O
are O
twenty B-QUANTITY
six I-QUANTITY
point I-QUANTITY
two I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
in O
a O
marathon O
. O

by O
my O
math O
that O
would O
be O
what O
about O
seventy B-PERCENT
five I-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
way O
there O
? O

That O
sounds O
pretty O
upbeat O
. O

Yeah O
it O
was O
a O
very O
upbeat O
assessment O
. O

Uh O
I O
hope O
it O
's O
realistic O
. O

When O
he O
testified O
in O
front O
of O
us O
it O
did O
n't O
sound O
that O
way O
quite O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

He O
said O
that O
the O
insurgency O
has O
not O
declined O
. O

Uh O
he O
said O
that O
there O
's O
an O
increased O
number O
of O
Jihadist B-NORP
coming O
across O
the O
border O
into O
Iraq B-GPE
to O
fight O
. O

Uh O
that O
does O
n't O
sound O
like O
decline O
to O
me O
. O

It O
's O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
dynamic O
which O
I O
think O
we O
ought O
to O
say O
is O
acceptable O
. O

And O
the O
status O
quo O
to O
me O
is O
just O
simply O
not O
working O
. O

and O
we O
've O
got O
to O
change O
the O
current O
dynamic O
in O
a O
number O
of O
ways O
. O

Vice O
President O
also O
as O
you O
know O
for O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
several I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
has O
had O
an O
upbeat O
assessment O
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
listen O
to O
what O
he O
said O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
what O
he O
told O
Larry B-PERSON
King I-PERSON
and O
what O
he O
told O
me O
on O
Thursday B-DATE
. O

Listen O
to O
this O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
excerpts O
from O
the O
Vice O
President O
. O

I O
think O
they O
're O
in O
the O
-- O
in O
the O
last O
throes O
if O
you O
will O
of O
the O
insurgency O
. O

we O
've O
- O

If O
you O
look O
at O
what O
the O
dictionary O
says O
about O
throes O
it O
can O
still O
be O
a O
you O
know O
violent O
period O
the O
throes O
of O
a O
revolution O
. O

He O
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
be O
backing O
away O
from O
those O
controversial O
comments O
the O
last O
throes O
of O
of O
the O
insurgency O
. O

You O
're O
privy O
to O
all O
the O
intelligence O
as O
both O
the O
member O
of O
the O
armed B-ORG
services I-ORG
and O
the O
intelligence B-ORG
committees O
. O

what O
's O
your O
bottom O
line O
assessment O
? O

Well O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
that O
assessment O
of O
the O
Vice O
President O
is O
a O
rosy O
colored O
scenario O
. O

just O
the O
way O
going O
into O
Iraq B-GPE
was O
rose O
colored O
. O

Uh O
when O
he O
relies O
on O
the O
dictionary O
to O
define O
the O
word O
throes O
he O
's O
leaving O
out O
the O
word O
that O
he O
put O
before O
throes O
which O
is O
the O
word O
last O
. O

He O
said O
it O
was O
the O
last O
throes O
of O
the O
insurgency O
. O

and O
I O
think O
he O
's O
got O
to O
just O
have O
his O
eyes O
closed O
to O
what O
the O
reality O
is O
over O
there O
. O

Our O
troops O
deserve O
the O
most O
objective O
clearest O
assessment O
that O
they O
can O
possibly O
get O
. O

They O
are O
tremendous O
people O
. O

The O
men O
and O
women O
over O
there O
in O
harm O
's O
way O
deserve O
everything O
we O
can O
provide O
for O
them O
. O

and O
that O
includes O
the O
most O
realistic O
assessment O
we O
can O
give O
them O
. O

To O
suggest O
that O
this O
insurgency O
is O
in O
the O
last O
throes O
flies O
right O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
testimony O
of O
our O
leaders O
which O
was O
given O
to O
us O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
and O
also O
the O
testimony O
for O
instance O
of O
the O
uh O
spokesman O
for O
the O
central O
command O
who O
said O
that O
this O
insurgency O
is O
not O
declining O
and O
that O
the O
number O
of O
jihadist B-NORP
coming O
across O
the O
border O
is O
increasing O
. O

But O
you O
will O
acknowledge O
that O
General O
Abizaid B-PERSON
at O
least O
this O
morning B-TIME
here O
on O
Late B-WORK_OF_ART
Edition I-WORK_OF_ART
seemed O
to O
get O
close O
to O
what O
the O
vice O
president O
is O
saying O
when O
he O
said O
the O
US B-GPE
is O
at O
mile O
twenty B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
in O
a O
twenty B-QUANTITY
six I-QUANTITY
mile I-QUANTITY
marathon O
. O

Alright O
well O
I O
have O
n't O
run O
a O
marathon O
. O

Uh O
you O
probably O
can O
see O
that O
uh O
for O
your O
self O
. O

But O
uh O
I O
'm O
not O
a O
marathoner O
. O

But O
nonetheless O
the B-TIME
last I-TIME
five I-TIME
minutes I-TIME
the B-QUANTITY
last I-QUANTITY
five I-QUANTITY
miles I-QUANTITY
I O
understand O
are O
the O
toughest O
. O

I O
hope O
we O
're O
at O
mile O
twenty B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
. O

But O
I O
've O
got O
to O
tell O
you O
I O
just O
do O
n't O
see O
from O
the O
casualty O
numbers O
which O
continue O
to O
be O
about O
the O
same O
even O
getting O
worse O
. O

And O
what O
General O
Abizaid B-PERSON
also O
said O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
was O
that O
as O
long O
as O
the O
political O
process O
keeps O
moving O
along O
that O
then O
there O
's O
some O
real O
hope O
that O
there O
'll O
be O
a O
good O
conclusion O
fairly O
soon O
but O
in O
order O
for O
the O
political O
process O
to O
move O
along O
that O
means O
that O
there O
must O
be O
a O
constitution O
which O
is O
agreed O
upon O
by O
August B-DATE
the I-DATE
fifteenth I-DATE
. O

Uh O
there O
's O
one B-CARDINAL
six B-DATE
month I-DATE
extension O
permitted O
. O

but O
that O
's O
it O
. O

There O
's O
a O
timetable O
which O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
have O
set O
for O
themselves O
and O
accepted O
. O

And O
we O
must O
insist O
it O
. O

And O
this O
administration O
must O
insist O
. O

And O
I O
hope O
the O
President O
will O
insist O
on O
Tuesday B-TIME
night I-TIME
that O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
live O
up O
to O
that O
timetable O
because O
if O
that O
political O
process O
does O
not O
move O
along O
on O
that O
timetable O
the O
military O
solution O
can O
not O
solve O
this O
problem O
. O

And O
they O
ought O
to O
tell O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
the O
administration O
that O
we O
expect O
them O
to O
live O
up O
to O
that O
timetable O
August B-DATE
fifteenth I-DATE
. O

One B-CARDINAL
six B-DATE
month I-DATE
extension O
. O

Elections O
. O

first B-ORDINAL
of O
all O
approval O
of O
the O
Constitution B-LAW
by O
the O
people O
then O
elections O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

and O
they O
should O
be O
told O
that O
we O
can O
not O
make O
an O
open O
- O
ended O
commitment O
to O
you O
. O

We O
can O
not O
stay O
there O
the O
way O
the O
secretary O
of O
state B-ORG
Rice B-PERSON
said O
we O
'll O
stay O
there O
as O
long O
as O
they O
need O
us O
. O

That O
is O
too O
open O
- O
ended O
. O

They O
should O
be O
told O
that O
we O
will O
have O
to O
reconsider O
our O
position O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
live O
up O
to O
your O
time O
table O
including O
including O
the O
withdrawal O
of O
American B-NORP
forces O
. O

That O
to O
me O
is O
the O
key O
. O

But O
you O
're O
not O
calling O
for O
a O
timetable O
directly O
right O
now O
as O
some O
other O
democratic B-NORP
and O
even O
a O
few O
republican B-NORP
colleagues O
are O
suggesting O
that O
there O
should O
be O
a O
timetable O
. O

you O
're O
not O
going O
that O
far O
? O

No O
I O
am O
not O
saying O
that O
we O
should O
set O
the O
timetable O
now O
. O

What O
I O
am O
saying O
and O
this O
is O
critically O
important O
is O
that O
we O
should O
tell O
the O
Iraqis B-NORP
not O
just O
that O
we O
expect O
them O
to O
live O
up O
to O
their O
own O
timetable O
for O
adopting O
a O
constitution O
but O
that O
if O
they O
do O
not O
live O
up O
to O
that O
timetable O
, O
since O
the O
political O
process O
is O
the O
only O
hope O
for O
defeating O
the O
insurgency O
, O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
live O
up O
to O
their O
own O
timetable O
we O
would O
then O
have O
to O
consider O
all O
options O
including O
but O
not O
limited O
to O
removal O
of O
our O
troops O
. O

The O
defense B-ORG
secretary O
Donald B-PERSON
Rumsfeld I-PERSON
testified O
before O
your O
committee O
other O
committees O
in O
congress B-ORG
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
. O

uh O
I O
want O
you O
to O
listen O
to O
what O
he O
said O
about O
the O
battle O
readiness O
the O
readiness O
of O
Iraqi B-NORP
troops O
right O
now O
. O

Today B-DATE
dozens B-CARDINAL
of O
trained O
battalions O
are O
capable O
of O
conducting O
anti-insurgent O
operations O
albeit O
with O
coalition O
support O
. O

Now O
you O
do O
n't O
dispute O
that O
? O

No O
it O
's O
the O
number O
that O
can O
operate O
independently O
which O
is O
just O
a O
few O
. O

That O
's O
the O
key O
issue O
. O

They O
can O
work O
with O
us O
and O
be O
with O
us O
. O

but O
how O
many O
can O
handle O
the O
insurgents O
on O
their O
own O
? O

It O
's O
very O
few O
. O

the O
reports O
that O
have O
been O
printed O
say O
three B-CARDINAL
. O

Do O
you O
uh O
want O
the O
defense B-ORG
secretary O
Donald B-PERSON
Rumsfeld I-PERSON
like O
senator O
Kennedy B-PERSON
does O
to O
resign O
? O

I O
think O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
policy O
that O
Rumsfeld B-PERSON
is O
implementing O
. O

If O
I O
thought O
his O
resignation O
would O
change O
the O
policies O
and O
would O
help O
to O
change O
the O
course O
and O
change O
the O
dynamic O
then O
I O
would O
favor O
him O
. O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
problem O
here O
that O
we O
've O
had O
right O
from O
the O
beginning O
is O
overly O
optimistic O
predictions O
on O
the O
part O
of O
what O
would O
happen O
if O
we O
attacked O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

And O
it O
's O
these O
policies O
which O
need O
to O
be O
changed O
. O

and O
the O
resignation O
does O
not O
effectuate O
the O
change O
in O
policy O
. O

so O
I O
'm O
focusing O
on O
the O
policies O
and O
what O
needs O
to O
be O
done O
to O
change O
those O
policies O
. O

You O
heard O
General O
Abizaid B-PERSON
also O
express O
concern O
about O
the O
morale O
if O
you O
will O
of O
the O
US B-GPE
men O
and O
women O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
elsewhere O
. O

Increasingly O
he O
's O
being O
asked O
questions O
whether O
the O
American B-NORP
people O
are O
behind O
them O
support O
what O
they O
're O
doing O
. O

How O
do O
you O
as O
a O
concerned O
critic O
of O
the O
policy O
of O
the O
war O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
deal O
with O
that O
kind O
of O
uh O
situation O
? O

By O
telling O
the O
men O
and O
women O
how O
much O
we O
're O
determined O
to O
support O
them O
as O
long O
as O
they O
're O
there O
that O
we O
're O
also O
determined O
to O
be O
constructive O
critics O
of O
the O
policies O
which O
not O
only O
sent O
them O
there O
as O
un- O
uh O
unequipped O
and O
without O
the O
international O
support O
and O
without O
plans O
for O
the O
aftermath O
. O

Uh O
those O
chickens O
are O
coming O
home O
to O
roost O
constantly O
. O

But O
constructive O
critics O
of O
the O
policies O
nonetheless O
are O
totally O
committed O
to O
support O
the O
men O
and O
women O
in O
our O
military O
. O

They O
deserve O
no O
less O
than O
the O
best O
thinking O
the O
most O
realistic O
thinking O
that O
we O
provide O
them O
. O

They O
're O
entitled O
to O
that O
. O

and O
as O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
the O
the O
the O
critics O
are O
determined O
that O
this O
time O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
like O
Vietnam B-GPE
, O
this O
time O
as O
long O
as O
our O
men O
and O
women O
are O
there O
everything O
we O
possibly O
can O
do O
to O
support O
them O
is O
going O
to O
be O
done O
including O
realistic O
thinking O
and O
constructive O
criticism O
. O

A O
final O
question O
uh O
Senator O
. O

On O
the O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
controversy O
that O
erupted O
this B-DATE
week I-DATE
the O
deputy O
white B-ORG
house I-ORG
chief O
of O
staff O
said O
this O
in O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
. O

I O
want O
you O
to O
listen O
. O

Conservatives O
saw O
the O
savagery O
of O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
and O
the O
attacks O
and O
prepared O
for O
war O
. O

Liberals O
saw O
the O
savagery O
of O
the O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
attacks O
and O
wanted O
to O
prepare O
indictments O
and O
offer O
therapy O
and O
understanding O
to O
our O
attackers O
. O

He O
said O
-- O
uh O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
insists O
he O
was O
referring O
to O
moveon B-ORG
dot I-ORG
org I-ORG
and O
Micheal B-PERSON
Moore I-PERSON
. O

uh O
what O
do O
you O
say O
in O
response O
to O
what O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
said O
? O

Well O
the O
context O
is O
that O
the O
opposition O
to O
this O
administration O
is O
somehow O
or O
another O
weak O
and O
does O
n't O
respond O
to O
terrorism O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
shameful O
. O

They O
ought O
to O
apologize O
for O
it O
. O

President O
ought O
to O
disown O
it O
. O

Um O
and O
uh O
it O
is O
-- O
it O
is O
just O
so O
disgraceful O
to O
split O
Americans B-NORP
to O
divide O
Americans B-NORP
for O
any O
kind O
of O
perceived O
political O
gain O
. O

I O
think O
it O
backfires O
when O
something O
like O
that O
is O
done O
. O

And O
I O
hope O
that O
the O
uh O
president O
would O
disassociate O
himself O
and O
tell O
Karl B-PERSON
Rove I-PERSON
that O
he O
ought O
to O
be O
ashamed O
of O
himself O
for O
stooping O
to O
that O
level O
to O
divide O
us O
in O
order O
to O
try O
to O
pander O
to O
a O
particular O
audience O
or O
to O
make O
some O
kind O
of O
perceived O
adminis- O
uh O
political O
gain O
. O

Thank O
god O
those O
kind O
of O
attacks O
backfire O
. O

The O

Mr. O

thanks O

for O

Welcome O
to O
Late B-WORK_OF_ART
Edition I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

You O
're O
seen O
as O
a O
close O
ally O
of O
Syria B-GPE
. O

In O
the O
aftermath O
of O
the O

are O
you O
inclined O
to O
move O
Lebanon B-GPE
away O
from O
that O
close O
alliance O
with O
Syria B-GPE
? O

At O
first O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
say O
that O
there O
are O
historic O
links O
between O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Lebanon B-GPE
that O
has O
been O
a O
long O
time O
. O

And O
uh O
we O
have O
been O
uh O
on O
very O
friendly O
terms O
for O
long O
time O
. O

And O
if O
you O
look O
at O
the O
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
you O
see O
that O
uh O
we O
have O
the O
sea O
and O
we O
have O
Syria B-GPE
on O
most O
of O
our O
borders O
and O
uh O
in O
the O
south O
we O
have O
Israel B-GPE
. O

So O
we O
have O
to O
be O
on O
very O
good O
terms O
with O
Syria B-GPE
and O
continue O
to O
do O
that O
. O

Mr. O
President O
uh O
there O
have O
been O
a O
series O
of O
assassinations O
though O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
including O
the O
former O
prime O
minister O
. O

Two O
other O
anti-Syrian B-NORP
personalities O
were O
assassinated O
in O
recent B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

Many O
see O
the O
hand O
of O
the O
Syrian B-NORP
government O
behind O
these O
assassinations O
. O

do O
you O
? O

Well O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
ones O
that O
did O
this O
assassination O
abominable O
assassination O
uh O
against O
late O
prime O
minister O
are O
the O
enemies O
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

And O
they O
want O
to O
do O
harm O
to O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

And O
who O
could O
be O
the O
enemies O
who O
benefited O
from O
that O
? O

For O
sure O
it O
's O
not O
Lebanon B-GPE
nor O
Syria B-GPE
because O
until O
the O
assassination O
everything O
was O
fine O
, O
the O
stability O
and O
security O
were O
at O
its O
best O
according O
to O
Interpol B-ORG
who O
are O
number B-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
on O
the O
list O
of O
security O
in O
the O
world O
. O

And O
what O
happened O
made O
us O
uh O
go O
back O
because O
we O
lost O
a O
lot O
by O
it O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
that O
nobody O
harms O
himself O
. O

So O
it O
could O
n't O
be O
Syria B-GPE
nor O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

It O
must O
be O
the O
enemies O
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

Who O
do O
you O
see O
as O
responsible O
for O
those O
assassinations O
therefore O
? O

Well O
it O
could O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
two B-CARDINAL
. O

First B-ORDINAL
we O
had O
troubles O
as O
you O
know O
a O
few O
years O
back O
with O
the O
fundamentalists O
. O

And O
uh O
even O
before O
nine B-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
we O
had O
uh O
an O
attack O
on O
our O
soldiers O
. O

and O
we O
lost O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
. O

and O
we O
had O
to O
react O
. O

and O
we O
put O
them O
in O
prison O
. O

That O
was O
before O
the B-EVENT
nine I-EVENT
eleven I-EVENT
. O

Eh O
and O
at O
this O
time O
we O
were O
asked O
why O
we O
did O
that O
. O

We O
said O
because O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
unstable O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

And O
eh O
another O
thing O
happened O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
before O
the O
assassination O
of O
president O
. O

And O
that O
was O
when O
uh O
eh O
uh O
they O
tried O
to O
put O
a O
bomb O
in O
the O
uh O
Italian B-NORP
embassy O
. O

So O
you O
are O
-- O
are O
you O
accusing O
Al O
Queda O
Mr. O
uh O
Mr. O
President O
? O

Excuse O
me O
for O
interrupting O
. O

And O
now O
they O
are O
- O

Are O
you O
accusing O
Al O
Queda O
of O
being O
responsible O
? O

I O
can O
say O
it O
's O
a O
fundamentalist O
group O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
who O
they O
belong O
to O
. O

but O
uh O
we O
had O
them O
a O
few O
years O
back O
. O

and O
we O
had O
it O
a O
months O
ago O
. O

they O
are O
fundamentalists O
. O

Listen O
to O
what O
-- O
listen O
to O
what O
the O
-- O
listen O
to O
what O
the O
spokesman O
at O
the B-FAC
White I-FAC
House I-FAC
the O
press O
secretary O
Scott B-PERSON
McClellan I-PERSON
said O
on O
June B-DATE
tenth I-DATE
. O

listen O
to O
this O
. O

That O
would O
be O
one O
of O
the O
reasons O
. O

There O
are O
reports O
that O
we O
have O
been O
hearing O
about O
for O
some O
time O
about O
a O
Syrian B-NORP
hit O
list O
targetting O
key O
Lebanese B-NORP
public O
figures O
. O

He O
suggests O
that O
there O
's O
a O
Syrian B-NORP
hit O
list O
targetting O
Lebanese B-NORP
politicians O
. O

So O
you O
totally O
disagree O
with O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
on O
the O
possibility O
that O
Syrian B-NORP
intelligence O
may O
be O
responsible O
for O
these O
assassinations O
. O

I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
Syria B-GPE
is O
the O
most O
that O
is O
losing O
uh O
because O
of O
these O
assassinations O
. O

So O
why O
should O
they O
do O
it O
? O

Whereas O
as O
I O
said O
the O
fundamentalist O
who O
tried O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
back I-DATE
and O
only B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
before O
the O
assassination O
could O
be O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
suspects O
. O

Another O
one B-CARDINAL
could O
be O
our O
permanent O
enemy O
. O

As O
you O
know O
we O
have O
still O
troubles O
in O
the O
south O
. O

and O
it O
could O
be O
that O
they O
are O
trying O
again O
. O

And O
we O
've O
had O
assassinations O
before O
Mr. O
. O

We O
had O
an O
ex O
uh O
minister O
. O

we O
had O
. O

we O
had O
. O

and O
at O
the O
time O
Israel B-GPE
was O
accused O
. O

So O
why O
now O
? O

They O
're O
trying O
to O
accuse O
Lebanon B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
. O

A O
lot O
of O
observers O
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
blame O
Syria B-GPE
's O
interference O
in O
Lebanese B-NORP
politics O
over O
the B-DATE
years I-DATE
most O
recently O
getting O
the O
parliament O
to O
extend O
your O
term O
of O
office O
for O
another O
term O
for O
another B-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
as O
being O
responsible O
for O
this O
current O
wave O
of O
anti-Syrian B-NORP
attitudes O
reflected O
in O
the O
elections O
that O
have O
occured O
over O
these B-DATE
past I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

Are O
you O
thinking O
about O
resigning O
? O

For O
sure O
I O
'm O
not O
resigning O
. O

I O
'm O
staying O
until O
the O
end O
of O
my O
term O
. O

and O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
I O
was O
elected O
by O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
parliament O
. O

The O
ex-prime O
minister O
Mr. O
uh O
gave O
me O
his O
votes O
as O
well O
. O

So O
why O
do O
they O
say O
that O
it O
was O
the O
Syrians B-NORP
that O
did O
that O
? O

It O
was O
in O
a O
free O
will O
by O
the O
members O
of O
parliament O
. O

The O
United B-ORG
Nations I-ORG
secretary O
general O
said O
this O
recently O
. O

He O
said O
we O
are O
now O
receiving O
reports O
that O
there O
may O
be O
elements O
that O
are O
still O
there O
. O

and O
we O
are O
considering O
the O
possible O
return O
of O
the O
verification O
team O
to O
ascertain O
what O
's O
going O
on O
. O

He O
was O
referring O
to O
the O
possibility O
that O
Syrian B-NORP
intelligence O
agents O
are O
still O
operating O
inside O
Lebanon B-GPE
even O
though O
the O
Syrian B-NORP
military O
has O
withdrawn O
. O

Have O
Syrian B-NORP
intelligence O
operatives O
left O
Lebanon B-GPE
? O

Well O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
there O
is O
a O
fact O
uh O
finding O
mission O
by O
the O
UN B-ORG
that O
is O
looking O
at O
this O
uh O
subject O
and O
uh O
there O
will O
be O
reporting O
in O
two B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
. O

And O
we O
will O
know O
the O
answer O
. O

but O
all O
I O
know O
myself O
is O
that O
all O
the O
have O
withdrawn O
with O
their O
intelligence O
. O

And O
now O
there O
is O
nobody O
of O
the O
Syrians B-NORP
. O

and O
uh O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
uh O
you O
will O
hear O
a O
lot O
of O
speculation O
always O
about O
this O
subject O
but O
never O
eh O
somebody O
showing O
any O
proof O
of O
that O
. O

The O
United B-ORG

for O

I O
'm O
quoting O
now O
for O
the O
disbanding O
and O
disarmament O
of O
all O
Lebanese B-NORP
and O
non-Lebanese B-NORP
militias O
. O

Do O
you O
want O
Hezbollah O
the O
Hezbollah B-ORG
militia O
to O
disarm O
to O
give O
up O
their O
weapons O
and O
only O
have O
a O
Lebanese B-NORP
army O
that O
has O
weapons O
? O

Well O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
this O
uh O
matter O
eh O
eh O
for O
Lebanese B-NORP
the O
Hezbollah B-ORG
the O
majority O
of O
Lebanese B-NORP
consider O
it O
as O
a O
national O
resistance O
because O
they O
freed O
Lebanon B-GPE
of O
Israel B-GPE
. O

We O
still O
have O
the O
. O

And O
this O
subject O
you O
can O
not O
do O
it O
by O
force O
. O

it O
must O
have O
a O
consensus O
between O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
. O

And O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
agree O
on O
that O
. O

And O
because O
of O
that O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
Lebanese B-NORP
to O
decide O
. O

and O
it O
should O
n't O
be O
done O
by O
force O
. O

All O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
still O
Lebanon B-GPE
is O
at O
war O
, O
it O
's O
not O
at O
peace O
. O

As O
you O
know O
we O
still O
have O
problems O
. O

and O
they O
have O
n't O
finished O
. O

one O
of O
them O
is O
the O
presentation O
of O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
who O
are O
in O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

And O
this O
is O
a O
very O
grave O
problem O
for O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

Lebanese B-NORP
consider O
in O
their O
constitution O
that O
there O
will O
not O
be O
any O
of O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
nor O
there O
will O
be O
any O
partition O
of O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

So O
all O
these O
problems O
have O
n't O
finished O
yet O
. O

So O
it O
's O
up O
to O
the O
Lebanese B-NORP
to O
decide O
between O
themselves O
and O
not O
do O
it O
by O
force O
. O

We O
are O
so O
happy O
that O
we O
have O
reached O
the O
stability O
that O
many O
countries O
in O
the O
area O
envy O
us O
. O

so O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
lose O
that O
stability O
. O

All O
we O
say O
is O
that O
we O
are O
in O
to O
know O
what O
will O
the O
UN B-ORG
investigation O
team O
concerning O
these O
assassinations O
will O
get O
to O
. O

And O
uh O
just O
between O
brackets O
before O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
UN B-ORG
I O
had O
asked O
for O
an O
investigation O
UN B-ORG
team O
to O
come O
and O
when O
they O
will O
come O
reach O
to O
a O
point O
when O
we O
'll O
know O
whoever O
is O
doing O
these O
assassinations O
. O

Then O
the O
truth O
will O
be O
known O
. O

And O
be O
sure O
. O

there O
are O
people O
who O
are O
against O
Lebanon B-GPE
. O

Fresenius B-ORG
, O
a O
West B-NORP

been O
discussing O
a O

You O
mention O
that O
I O
always O
had O
a O
very O
big O
question O
about O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Water I-WORK_OF_ART
Margin I-WORK_OF_ART
. O

What O
's O
so O
good O
about O
this O
book O
on O
earth O
that O
it O
is O
grouped O
as O
one O
of O
the O
four O
great O
classic O
novels O
. O

There O
are O
excellent O
parts O
of O
the O
book O
, O
but O
as O
a O
novel O
, O
the O
makeup O
of O
characters O
is O
quite O
flawed O
. O

For O
example O
, O
this B-PERSON
Hu I-PERSON
San I-PERSON
Niang I-PERSON
, O
with O
all O
her O
loved O
ones O
recklessly O
slaughtered O
by O
Li B-PERSON
Kui I-PERSON
, O
if O
she O
had O
any O
guts O
at O
all O
, O
she O
should O
have O
fought O
it O
out O
with O
that O
guy O
. O

Yet O
she O
became O
sworn O
sister O
with O
her O
enemy O
and O
degraded O
herself O
by O
marrying O
a O
short O
ugly O
man O
. O

What O
is O
the O
hell O
going O
on O
here O
. O

This O
group O
of O
so O
- O
called O
heroes O
did O
some O
righteous O
deeds O
, O
but O
they O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
lousy O
things O
as O
well O
. O

By O
mentioning O
that O
, O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
like O
a O
novel O
about O
gangster O
lowlifes O
. O

If O
a O
boy O
uses O
this O
book O
as O
inspiration O
, O
it O
seems O
he O
would O
have O
a O
great O
chance O
of O
going O
down O
the O
road O
of O
a O
criminal O
lowlife O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
its O
historical O
themes O
, O
it O
diverges O
too O
much O
from O
real O
history O
. O

Song B-PERSON
Jiang I-PERSON

uprising O
was O
not O
that O
awe O
- O
inspiring O
. O

It O
seems O
it O
was O
quelled O
by O
royalist O
Zhang B-PERSON
Shuye I-PERSON
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Water I-WORK_OF_ART
Margin I-WORK_OF_ART
is O
simply O
not O
on O
par O
with O
the O
other O
three O
books O

but O
declined O
to O

. O

IBM B-ORG
, O
which O
said O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE

it O
was O
inviting O
companies O
to O
participate O
in O
some O
semiconductor O
work O
, O
has O
become O
far O
more O
open O
about O
its O
technology O
as O
it O
has O
tried O
to O
rally O
U.S. B-GPE
industry O
to O
head O
off O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
, O
who O
now O
dominate O
the O
market O
for O
dynamic O

. O

While O
IBM B-ORG
, O
Armonk B-GPE

, O
makes O

it O

it O
does O

make O
the O

And O
IBM B-ORG
worries O
that O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
will O
take O
over O
that O
equipment O
market O
, O
too O
, O
unless O
U.S. B-GPE
semiconductor O
companies O
produce O
enough O
memory O
chips O
here O
to O
keep O
U.S. B-GPE
equipment O
makers O
healthy O
. O

Failure O
of O
U.S. B-GPE
equipment O
makers O
, O
IBM B-ORG
fears O
, O
would O
leave O
it O
dependent O
on O
many O
of O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
companies O
that O
compete O
with O
it O
in O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
market O
. O

IBM B-ORG
also O
said O
it O
expects O
to O
benefit O
from O
the O
expertise O
that O
Motorola B-ORG
and O
other O
companies O
can O
bring O
to O
bear O
on O
the O
difficult O
problems O
involved O
in O
semiconductor O
manufacturing O
. O

IBM B-ORG
already O
participates O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
industrywide O
effort O
to O
improve O
semiconductor O
- O
manufacturing O
techniques O
. O

IBM B-ORG
said O
it O
expects O
industrywide O
efforts O
to O
become O
prevalent O
because O
semiconductor O
manufacturing O
has O
become O
so O
expensive O
. O

A O

but O
costs O

today B-DATE
because O
the O
technology O
is O
so O
complex O

And O
IBM B-ORG
said O
it O
expects O
the O
costs O
to O
continue O
climbing O
. O

IBM B-ORG
, O
which O
said O
Motorola B-ORG
is O
paying O
just O
a O
nominal O
fee O
to O
cover O
the O
21 B-DATE

month I-DATE
agreement O
, O
acknowledged O
some O
companies O
had O
turned O
down O
its O
invitation O
to O
join O
in O
. O

But O
it O
said O
that O
was O
mainly O
because O
the O
project O
may O
not O
bear O
fruit O
until O
the B-DATE
mid-1990s I-DATE
. O

IBM B-ORG
said O
it O
thought O
more O
companies O
would O
become O
interested O
as O
the O
project O
progresses O
. O

The O
project O
involving O
Motorola B-ORG
concerns O
a O
technique O
, O
called O
X-ray O
lithography O
, O
that O
figures O
to O
be O
crucial O
to O
future O
generations O
of O
memory O
chips O
. O

Currently O
, O
chips O
are O
produced O
by O
shining O
light O
through O
a O
mask O
to O
produce O
an O
image O
on O
the O
chip O
, O
much O
as O
a O
camera O
produces O
an O
image O
on O
film O
. O

But O
details O
on O
chips O
must O
now O
be O
extraordinarily O
fine O
, O
and O
the O
wavelengths O
of O
even O
ultraviolet O
light O
are O
long O
enough O
so O
that O
the O
images O
they O
draw O
may O
be O
too O
blurry O
-- O
much O
as O
someone O
using O
a O
wide O
paintbrush O
could O
produce O
a O
broad O
line O
but O
would O
have O
trouble O
painting O
a O
thin O
one O
. O

X-rays O
, O
by O
contrast O
, O
travel O
straighter O
and O
can O
be O
focused O
more O
tightly O
than O
light O
. O

X-rays O
have O
problems O
, O
too O
. O

They O
can O
make O
the O
masks O
brittle O
and O
can O
pass O
through O
material O
they O
're O
not O
supposed O
to O
. O

But O
, O
assuming O
those O
problems O
can O
be O
overcome O
, O
they O
should O
allow O
for O
memory O
chips O
that O
could O
approach O
one B-QUANTITY

Pali B-GPE
was O
originally O
called O
Palifen B-GPE
, O
a O
transliteration O
of O
the O
place O
name O
used O
by O
the O
Ketagalan B-NORP
indigenous O
people O
. O

Located O
on O
the O
northwest O
corner O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
Pali B-GPE
faces O
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait I-LOC
to O
the O
northwest O
, O
rests O
against O
Mt. B-LOC
Kuanyin I-LOC
to O
the O
southeast O
, O
and O
looks O
across O
the O
river O
toward O
Tanshui B-GPE
to O
the O
northeast O
. O

Though O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
much O
of O
a O
hinterland O
, O
its O
geographic O
location O
has O
proved O
historically O
important O
, O
as O
one O
can O
see O
from O
the O
prehistoric O
cultures O
unearthed O

Later O
, O
when O
Han B-NORP
Chinese I-NORP
began O
trickling O
across O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
they O
mainly O
settled O
along O
rivers O
. O

Because O
Pali B-GPE
is O
relatively O
close O
to O
the O
mainland O
and O
sits O
at O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
river O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
natural O
harbor O
, O
in O
1757 B-DATE
the O
Qing B-NORP
court O
designated O
it O
to O
be O
one O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
small O
number O
of O
official O
ports O
for O
maritime O
transport O
with O
the O
mainland O
. O

Thus O
began O
an O
era O
in O
which O
great O
ships O
sailed O
in O
and O
out O
of O
Pali B-GPE
. O

However O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
silting O
and O
a O
destructive O
typhoon O
that O
struck O
in O
1796 B-DATE
, O
Pali B-GPE
began O
to O
give O
way O
in O
importance O
to O
Tanshui B-GPE
, O
located O
just O
across O
the O
river O
. O

Once O
mainly O
dependent O
on O
fishing O
, O
Pali B-GPE
increasingly O
came O
to O
rely O
on O
farming O
. O

But O
the O
hilly O
terrain O
and O
strong O
winds O
meant O
that O
there O
was O
little O
good O
land O
. O

While O
the O
hardy O
people O
of O
Pali B-GPE
barely O
kept O
their O
stomachs O
filled O
, O
their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
left O
in O
search O
of O
a O
better O
life O
. O

Neither O
the O
Japanese B-NORP
occupation O
-LRB- O
which O
began O
in O
1895 B-DATE
-RRB- O
nor O
the O
return O
to O
Chinese B-NORP
rule O
-LRB- O
in O
1945 B-DATE
-RRB- O
brought O
much O
joy O
or O
change O
to O
this O
rural O
area O
. O

But O
in O
the B-DATE
1970s I-DATE
, O
urban O
planning O
came O
to O
Pali B-GPE
. O

It O
proved O
to O
be O
the O
prelude O
to O
a O
symphony O
-LRB- O
or O
perhaps O
cacophony O
-RRB- O
of O
transformation O
. O

Changing O
the O
rhythm O
of O
Pali B-GPE
life O

During O
the O
height O
of O
real O
estate O
speculation O
and O
soaring O
land O
prices O
in O
Taipei B-GPE
, O
builders O
put O
up O

-LRB- O

, O
in O

-RRB- O
one O

another O
in O
Pali B-GPE
. O

Also O
, O
to O
try O
to O
reduce O
the O
outflow O
of O
population O
from O
Pali B-GPE
and O
to O
get O
the O
stagnant O
local O
economy O
moving O
, O
the O
government O
decided O
to O
link O
this O
formerly O
isolated O
village O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
. O

What O
had O
been O
Chungshan B-FAC
Road I-FAC
was O
turned O
into O
Provincial B-FAC
Highway I-FAC
#15 I-FAC
, O
and O
the O
opening O
of O
the B-FAC
Kuantu I-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
to O
traffic O
linked O
Pali B-GPE
directly O
to O
the O
busy O
Taipei B-GPE
districts O
of O
Shilin B-GPE
and O
Peitou B-GPE
. O

Gifted O
with O
a O
lovely O
setting O
between O
the O
mountains O
and O
the O
sea O
, O
Pali B-GPE
began O
to O
dream O
of O
a O
tourism O
boom O
. O

But O
fortune O
had O
other O
things O
in O
store O
. O

In O
order O
to O
pave O
the O
way O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
water O
treatment O
facility O
on O
the O
northeast O
edge O
of O
Pali B-GPE
, O
the O
plan O
to O
develop O
tourism O
in O
Pali B-GPE
was O
scrapped O
overnight O
. O

The O
government O
, O
applying O
urban O
planning O
principles O
, O
zoned O
the O
area O
for O
residential O
and O
industrial O
use O
, O
in O
order O
to O
create O
a O
construction O
site O
for O
the O
facility O
. O

Then O
in O
1987 B-DATE
came O
the O
program O
to O
bring O
gravel O
from O
eastern O
to O
western O
Taiwan B-GPE
for O
construction O
purposes O
, O
and O
a O
harbor O
was O
built O
on O
the O
Pali B-GPE
coast O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
gravel O
transporters O
. O

In O
accordance O
with O
the O
urban O
plan O
, O
new O
streets O
were O
cut O
this O
way O
and O
that O
through O
Pali B-GPE
's O
land O
, O
and O
high O
- O
rise O
buildings O
sprang O
up O
along O
the O
sides O
of O
these O
roadways O
. O

The O
sounds O
of O
backhoes O
at O
work O
resounded O
even O
from O
the O
black O
sand O
beaches O
. O

In O
1997 B-DATE
, O
the O
Hsiachuotzu B-GPE
garbage O
landfill O
formally O
opened O
, O
and O
it O
became O
common O
to O
see O
fleets O
of O
garbage O
trucks O
winding O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
Pali B-GPE
. O

This O
rural O
township O
, O
which O
was O
made O
responsible O
for O
storing O
the O
garbage O
from O
several O
communities O
in O
Taipei B-GPE
County I-GPE
, O
seemed O
resigned O
to O
the O
fate O
-LRB- O
suffered O
by O
many O
outlying O
areas O
-RRB- O
of O
having O
to O
choke O
on O
the O
garbage O
spit O
up O
by O
others O
. O

It O
is O
only O
recently O
that O
the O
residents O
of O
Hsiachuotsu B-GPE
, O
unable O
to O
stand O
the O
smell O
, O
have O
begun O
to O
protest O

as O

of O
the O
dramatic O
changes O
that O
have O
come O
to O
this O

: O
" O
These O

have O
destroyed O

It O

that O
a O

they O
would O

But O
just O
because O

does O

mean O
someone O
will O
buy O
it O
, O
and O
just O
because O
apartment O

are O
built O
does O
n't O
mean O
there O
are O
people O
who O
want O
to O
live O
there O

Worst O
of O
all O
, O
interpersonal O
relationships O
have O
been O
poisoned O
in O
the O
struggle O
over O
divvying O
up O
the O

because O
no O

Lin B-PERSON
concludes O
: O
" O
I O
am O
not O
by O
any O

But O
development O
is O
not O
necessarily O
the O

Can O
the O

" O

All O

One B-CARDINAL

so O

The O

certainly O
brought O
in O
a O

The O

simple O

deep O

It O
is O
n't O
enough O
for O
these O

Why O
such O

It O
has O

One B-CARDINAL

Why O

They O

They O
're O

you O

to O
the O

Now O

As O

Mr. O

had O
to O
prove O
malice O

, O
as O
proof O
of O

Mr. O

contended O
that O

the O

For O
all O

this O
admission O
would O
have O
been O
sufficient O
to O
condemn O
the O
Malcolm B-PERSON

But O
Judge O
Arthur B-PERSON
Alarcon I-PERSON
, O
joined O
by O
Judge O
Cynthia B-PERSON
Holcomb I-PERSON
Hall I-PERSON
, O
took O
the O
astonishing O
position O
that O
it O
is O
perfectly O
OK O

fabricate O

so O
long O
as O
a O

finds O
that O
the O

rational O
interpretations O

In O
his O
eloquent O
dissent O
, O
Judge O
Alex B-PERSON
Kozinski I-PERSON
observed O
that O
when O
a O
writer O
uses O
quotation O
marks O
in O
reporting O
what O
someone O
has O
said O
, O
the O
reader O
assumes O
that O
these O
are O
the O

precise O
words O
or O
at O
least O
his O
words O
purged O
of O
`` O
uh O

and O
`` O
you O
know O
'' O
and O
grammatical O
error O

While O
judges O
have O
an O
obligation O
under O

`` O

Ms. O
Malcolm B-PERSON
, O
for O
example O
, O
wrote O
that O
Mr. O

described O
himself O
as O
`` O
the O
greatest O
analyst O
who O
ever O
lived O

'' O

No O
such O
statement O
appears O
on O

The O
majority O
cited O
Mr. O

remark O
`` O
It O
's O
me O

against O
the O
rest O
of O
the O

as O
warrant O
for O
the O
Malcolm B-PERSON
fabrication O
. O

But O
, O
as O
Judge O
Kozinski B-PERSON
noted O
, O
the O
context O
shows O
that O
Mr. O
Masson B-PERSON

`` O
me O
alone O
'' O
remark O
referred O
not O
to O
his O
alleged O
pre-eminence O
in O
his O
profession O
but O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
his O
position O
on O
a O
particular O
issue O
was O
not O
shared O
by O
anyone O
else O
. O

Ms. O
Malcolm B-PERSON
had O
Mr. O

describing O
himself O

'' O

Again O
, O
no O
such O
statement O
appears O
on O
the O
tapes O
. O

The O
majority O
decision O
contended O
that O
the O
phrase O
was O
a O
rational O
interpretation O
of O
Mr. O
Masson B-PERSON

description O
of O
himself O
as O

that O
in O
any O
case O
it O
was O
not O
defamatory O

Judge O
Kozinski B-PERSON
found O
the O
derivation O
entirely O

writes O
that O
`` O

It O

until O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE

only O
a O
civil O
action O
at O
most O
would O

Yet O
it O
is O
also O
axiomatic O
that O
the O

belongs O
only O

the O

not O

Beginning O

with O
U.S. B-GPE
v. O
Hudson B-PERSON

Goodwin B-PERSON
, O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
has O
repeatedly O
held O
that O
a O
judicial O
power O
to O
declare O
conduct O

be O
against O
the O
public O
interest O
and O
hence O
criminal O
, O
while O

established O

the O

began O

In O

a O

For O

although O

has O
never O

statutorily O
defined O
. O

In O
1983 B-DATE
, O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court I-ORG
tried O
to O
supply O
a O
workable O
definition O
in O
the O
Dirks B-PERSON
v. O
SEC B-ORG
decision O
, O
which O
found O
that O
liability O
depended O
on O
whether O
the O

breached O
his O
fiduciary O
duty O
to O
the O

in O

obtain O
`` O
some O

whether O
the O

knew O

recklessly O
disregarded O
this O
fact O
. O

Gradually O

however O
, O
lower O

have O
pushed O
this O
definition O

its O
breaking O
point O

Bernard B-PERSON
`` I-PERSON
Bunny I-PERSON
'' I-PERSON
Lasker I-PERSON
, O
that O
the O
deal O
was O
in O
trouble O
. O

After O
placing O
orders O
to O
sell O
, O
Mr. O
Freeman B-PERSON
called O
Martin B-PERSON
Siegel I-PERSON
, O
an O
investment O
banker O
at O
Kidder B-ORG
, I-ORG
Peabody I-ORG
-AMP- I-ORG
Co. I-ORG
, O
who O
was O
advising O
on O
the O
deal O
, O
to O
confirm O
these O
rumors O
. O

Mr. O
Siegel B-PERSON
asked O
Mr. O
Freeman B-PERSON
who O
his O
source O
was O
and O
, O
on O
hearing O
that O
it O
was O
Bunny B-PERSON
Lasker I-PERSON
, O
responded O
: O
`` O
Well O
, O
your O
bunny O
has O
a O
good O
nose O
. O
'' O

The O
illegal O
`` O
tip O
'' O
of O
the O
bunny O
's O
good O
nose O
was O
then O
largely O
a O
confirmation O
of O
rumors O
already O
known O
to O
many O
in O
the O
market O
. O

Had O
the O
case O
gone O
to O
trial O
the O
same O
issues O
would O
have O
surfaced O
: O

Was O
there O
a O
fiduciary O
breach O
in O
order O
to O
obtain O
personal O
gain O
? O

Did O
Mr. O
Freeman B-PERSON
have O
notice O
of O
this O
? O

Finally O
, O
was O
the O
information O
material O
? O

Yet O
, O
all O
these O
issues O
are O
subsidiary O
to O
a O
more O
central O
issue O
: O
Who O
is O
and O
who O
should O
be O
making O
the O
criminal O
law O
here O
? O

It O
is O
not O
my O
contention O
that O
either O
Mr. O
Chestman B-PERSON
or O
Mr. O
Freeman B-PERSON
was O
an O
innocent O
victim O
of O
prosecutorial O
overzealousness O
. O

Arguably O
, O
both O
were O
on O
notice O
that O
their O
behavior O
was O
at O
least O
risky O
. O

But O
even O
if O
they O
behaved O
recklessly O
, O
reasons O
still O
exist O
to O
fear O
and O
resist O
this O
steady O
process O
of O
case O
- O
by O
- O
case O
judicial O
extension O
of O
the O
law O
of O
insider O
trading O
. O

Courts O
and O
legislatures O
make O
decisions O
in O
very O
different O
ways O
and O
are O
each O
susceptible O
to O
very O
different O
kinds O
of O
errors O
. O

After O
- O
the O
- O
fact O
judicial O
examination O
of O
an O
actor O
's O
conduct O
has O
always O
been O
the O
common O
law O
's O
method O
. O

When O
only O
civil O
liability O
is O
involved O
, O
this O
method O
has O
the O
undeniable O
strengths O
of O
factual O
specificity O
and O
avoidance O
of O
overgeneralization O
. O

Still O
, O
case O
- O
by O
- O
case O
retrospective O
decision O
making O
of O
this O
sort O
is O
vulnerable O
to O
the O
tunnel O
vision O
caused O
by O
a O
fixation O
on O
ad O
hoc O
-LRB- O
and O
usually O
sleazy O
-RRB- O
examples O
. O

When O
a O
court O
decides O
that O
a O
particular O
actor O
's O
conduct O
was O
culpable O
and O
so O
extends O
the O
definition O
of O
insider O
trading O
to O
reach O
this O
conduct O
, O
it O
does O
not O
see O
the O
potentially O
enormous O
number O
of O
other O
cases O
that O
will O
be O
covered O
by O
the O
expanded O
rule O
. O

Thus O
, O
a O
court O
is O
poorly O
positioned O
to O
make O
judgments O
about O
the O
social O
utility O
of O
the O
expanded O
rule O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
focusing O
on O
Mr. O
Freeman B-PERSON
's O
attempt O
to O
gain O
nonpublic O
information O
about O
a O
deal O
's O
collapse O
, O
one O
does O
not O
naturally O
think O
about O
the O
reverse O
side O
of O
the O
coin O
: O
What O
if O
the O
rumor O
had O
been O
false O
? O

Can O
a O
security O
analyst O
call O
an O
investment O
banker O
to O
make O
certain O
that O
a O
seemingly O
improbable O
rumor O
is O
in O
fact O
false O
? O

In O
the O
past O
, O
not O
only O
would O
reputable O
professionals O
have O
rushed O
to O
check O
out O
such O
rumors O
with O
the O
company O
, O
but O
companies O
listed O
on O
the O
major O
stock O
exchanges O
were O
encouraged O
by O
the O
exchanges O
to O
respond O
openly O
to O
such O
inquiries O
from O
securities O
analysts O
. O

Today B-DATE
, O
after O
Mr. O
Freeman B-PERSON
's O
plea O
, O
there O
is O
an O
uncertainty O
that O
is O
both O
unfair O
and O
inefficient O

In O
this O
light O

the O
comparative O
advantages O

become O
clear O
: O
-LRB- O
1 B-CARDINAL

Before O

the O

those O

not O

the O

the O

Although O

explains O
why O
the O
SEC B-ORG
has O
long O
resisted O
a O
legislative O
definition O
of O
insider O
trading O
-RRB- O
, O
judicial O
lawmaking O
inevitably O
creates O
uncertainty O
because O
of O
the O
shadowy O
outer O
edges O
and O
implications O
of O
most O
judicial O

At O

when O

The O

even O

illustrations O
of O
the O
rapid O

In O
1987 B-DATE

the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG

attempted O

Yet O
, O
late B-DATE

Congress B-ORG
effectively O
reversed O
this O

a O

include O
any O

`` O

At O

possibly O
all O

-RRB- O

Such O
a O

illustrates O
the O
fundamental O

Congress B-ORG
finds O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
pass O
sweepingly O
moralistic O

which O
the O

interpret O

We O

Predictably O

The O

say O
the O

meant O
to O
pressure O
the O
Taliban B-ORG

to O
abandon O
its O
support O
of O

to O
surrender O

told O

his O
nation O
is O
strongly O
against O

it O

the O

We O
abhor O

We O
are O
with O
the O

As O
far O

this O

Mr. O

that O
instead O

the O

should O
engage O

Serge B-PERSON
Lavroff I-PERSON
says O
the O

does O
not O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O

I O
had O
a O
very O
lonely O
childhood O
because O
I O
was O
the O
only O
child O
in O
the O
family O
, O
and O
most O
of O
my O
playmates O
in O
the O

had O
moved O
to O
the O

. O

Life O
, O
like O
that O
small O
river O
in O
front O
of O
my O
home O
, O
flowed O
quietly O
without O
the O

ripple O
. O

I O
often O
stayed O
on O
the O
riverbank O
by O
myself O
, O
watching O
the O
boats O
pass O

. O

They O
were O
all O
very O
small O

, O
and O
under O
each O

was O
a O
household O

I O
did O
not O
know O
where O
they O
came O
from O

where O
they O
were O

It O
seemed O
that O
I O
never O
saw O
the O

twice O

My O
mother O
sometimes O
asked O
: O
" O

why O
do O
you O
go O

I O

" O

I O
could O
not O

I O
started O
to O
think O
that O
this O

must O
be O
very O
large O
, O
but O
that O
it O
does O
not O

I O
just O
stood O

I O
was O
twelve B-CARDINAL

Actually O
I O
graduated O

According O
to O
preliminary O

the O

of O

that O
the O

It O

that O
your O

this O

clearly O

also O
a O

uh O

That O

Uh O

Director O
Xu B-PERSON
made O
a O
statement O
that O
was O
true O
, O
ah O
, O
that O
is O
, O
from O
the O
viewpoint O
of O
the O
average O
consumer O
, O
there O
is O
a O
faily O
large O
gap O
between O
the O
technology O
in O
Chinese B-NORP
cars O
and O
the O
technology O
in O
foreign O

. O

So O
, O
why O
are O
you O
so O
confident O
. O

I O
always O
want O
to O
refer O
back O
to O
our O
country O
's O
, O
um O
, O
household O
appliances O
, O
ah O
, O
light O
industry O
, O
or O
the O
household O
appliance O
sector O
and O
compare O
it O
to O
our O
current O
vehicles O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
are O
differences O
between O
the O
two B-QUANTITY
industries O
, O
but O
let O
's O
look O
at O
the O
trend O
, O
look O
at O
the O
tide O
. O

Who O
ever O
thought O
, O
ah O
, O
five B-DATE
or I-DATE
six I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago O
, O
thought O
China B-GPE
's O
household O
appliance O
products O
would O
not O
only O
take O
hold O
of O
every O
corner O
of O
entire O
China B-GPE
, O
but O
also O
take O
hold O
of O
the O
better O
part O
of O
the O
international O
market O
. O

To O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
also O
did O
n't O
expect O
it O
, O
so O
I O
discovered O
just O
how O
low O
my O
level O
was O
, O
really O
. O

Really O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
I O
really O
did O
n't O
expect O
it O
. O

Later O
on O
, O
I O
also O
thought O
about O
this O
, O
that O
I O
had O
n't O
expected O
it O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Because O
at O
the O
outset O
, O
when O
joint O
- O
venture O
brands O
and O
, O
this O
, O
import O
brands O
were O
coming O
in O
, O
what O
everybody O
was O
crowding O
for O
and O
grabbing O
up O
were O
all O
those O
joint O
- O
venture O
brands O
and O
import O
brands O
, O
because O
they O
thought O
the O
quality O
was O
good O
. O

Well O
, O
then O
later O
on O
, O
we O
now O
discover O
that O
our O
domestically O
produced O
appliances O
are O
also O
extremely O
good O
. O

Not O
only O
do O
we O
use O
them O
ourselves O
, O
but O
we O
also O
export O
them O
. O

That O
is O
the O
truth O
. O

but O
the O

is O
not O

In O
the O
early O
period O
after O
the O

, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
large O

, O
namely O
the O
USSR B-GPE
, O
the O

the O

Henceforth O
, O
Germany B-GPE
was O

in O
a O

for O
a O
long O
period O
. O

Not O
long O
after O
, O
the O
contest O
between O
the O
US B-GPE

the O
USSR B-GPE
in O
Europe B-LOC
caused O
a O

on O

Germany B-GPE
, O
being O

became O
the O

of O
the O

confrontation O
between O
the O
East B-LOC

Henceforth O

there O
has O
not O

a O

in O
the O

But O
, O
since B-DATE
the I-DATE

of I-DATE
1989 I-DATE
, O
a O
new O
turn O
has O
occurred O
in O
the O

Radical O

in O

the O

the O

the O

all O
occurred O
successively O

causing O

In O
this O
great O
change O
, O
Germany B-GPE
became O
the O
largest O
beneficiary O

The O
rise O
of O
a O

has O
changed O
the O
proportion O
of O
strength O
in O

were O

about O

The O

the O

has O

The O
reason O
is O

the O

its O
